item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on improving protein therapeutics using our proprietary technologies 
our core technologies  glycoadvance and glycopegylation  enable us to manipulate  enzymatically  the carbohydrate structures of glycoproteins  and thereby pursue the objective of improving the therapeutic profiles of proteins that have already been marketed or substantially developed 
our business strategy is to use our technologies to improve proteins for which there exists a substantial body of data demonstrating safety and efficacy 
we intend to apply this strategy to next generation products that we are developing on our own or in collaboration with others 
we also expect to use our technologies  through strategic partners  to improve products of other parties 
we have incurred operating losses each year since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect additional losses in and over the next several years as we expand product research and development efforts  increase manufacturing scale up activities and  potentially  begin sales and marketing activities 
we have financed our operations through private and public offerings of equity securities  proceeds from debt financings  and revenues from our collaborative agreements 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  expected revenue from collaborations and license arrangements  expected proceeds under the credit agreement we entered into in january  and interest income should be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements into  although changes in our collaborative relationships or our business  whether or not initiated by us  may cause us to deplete our cash and marketable securities sooner than the above estimate 
under the terms of a credit agreement we entered into in january to borrow up to million  all of which we expect to borrow during the first quarter of  we have agreed to limit our total outstanding debt to million 
after using a portion of the proceeds to repay existing debt  our total debt outstanding will be approximately million 
at any time after the fourth year of the ten year loan period  or if we fail to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least million  the bank has the option to require additional collateral from us in the form of a letter of credit  which may have the effect of requiring us to repay the outstanding loan balance to the bank  or a security interest in certain cash and short term investments 
see long term debt other arrangements credit agreement in the liquidity and capital resources section of this form k for a description of the material features of this borrowing 
liquidity and capital resources overview we had  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december   compared to approximately  in cash and cash equivalents as of december  the increase for was primarily attributable to the proceeds of equity and debt financings  which were offset by the use of cash to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures  and debt repayments 
the development of next generation proprietary protein therapeutics  which we are pursuing both independently and in collaboration with selected partners  will require substantial expenditures by us and our collaborators 
to finance those expenditures  we plan to continue financing our operations through private and public offerings of equity securities  proceeds from debt financings  and revenues from existing and future collaborative agreements 
our revenues are difficult to project and will be largely dependent on entering into new collaborations and on the financial terms of any new collaborations 
other than revenues from our collaboration with novo nordisk  and any future collaborations with others  we expect to generate no significant revenues until such time as products incorporating our technologies are commercialized  which is not expected during the next 
table of contents several years 
we expect an additional several years to elapse before we can expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our operating and investing requirements 
accordingly  we will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our business activities and fund our operations beyond significant cash flows and proceeds from sales of equity during  our operating activities consumed  which included the receipt of a nonrefundable  upfront fee of  upon entering into our collaboration with novo nordisk 
in addition  we invested  in capital expenditures  and made debt principal repayments of  to finance these and future expenditures  we received  from public and private offerings of our common stock and  in proceeds from debt financings 
we also entered into capital lease obligations during for assets with aggregate book values of  in september  we sold  shares of common stock in a registered offering to a group of institutional and individual investors  generating net proceeds of  in february  we sold  shares of common stock in a private placement to a group of institutional and individual investors  generating net proceeds of  in addition  employees purchased  shares of common stock during pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  resulting in net proceeds of  during  we received proceeds of  upon the exercise of options to purchase  shares of common stock 
long term debt proceeds from arrangements in this section  we describe the material features of our new issuances of debt  and capital lease obligations entered into  during in the following section  long term debt other arrangements  we describe the material features of long term debt arrangements that did not involve new borrowings during  including a significant new agreement that we entered into in january to borrow up to  all of which we expect to borrow during the first quarter of equipment loans in december  we borrowed  to finance the purchase of equipment and facility improvements  which collateralize the amount borrowed 
the terms of the financing require us to pay monthly principal and interest payments over months at an interest rate of 
during  we will be required to make principal and interest payments totaling  under this agreement 
in september  we borrowed  to finance the purchase of equipment and facility improvements  which collateralize the amount borrowed

capital lease obligations in september  we entered into a capital lease for  of equipment 
the terms of the lease required us to make an initial payment of  followed by monthly payments through september during  we will be required to make lease payments totaling  under this agreement 
we also entered into a capital lease obligation during september for  of software 
the terms of the lease require us to make monthly payments through september during  we will be required to make lease payments totaling  under this agreement 

table of contents in june  we entered into a capital lease for  of equipment

in april and may  we entered into capital leases for  of equipment 
the terms of the leases require us to make monthly payments through april during  we will be required to make lease payments totaling  under these agreements 
long term debt other arrangements in this section  we describe the material features of our debt arrangements that did not involve new borrowings during  including a significant new agreement that we entered into in january to borrow up to  all of which we expect to borrow during the first quarter of in the previous section  long term debt proceeds from arrangements  we describe the material features of long term debt arrangements entered into during credit agreement in january  we borrowed  from a bank for the purpose of funding improvements to our leased facility in horsham  pa 
the credit agreement with our bank provides for us to borrow from the bank an additional  and to utilize  of our restricted cash for the purpose of paying in full the  outstanding of our taxable industrial development authority bonds  which payment we expect to occur during the first quarter of during the first quarter of  we expect to enter into another agreement with the bank for it to acquire and reissue the  outstanding of our tax exempt industrial development authority bonds 
if the tax exempt bond acquisition described above does not occur  the existing credit agreement provides for us to borrow an additional  for the purpose of paying in full the outstanding amount of the tax exempt industrial development authority bonds 
initially  the interest rate on the bonds will vary quarterly  depending on libor rates 
we will have the option each quarter to bear interest on the outstanding principal at a libor based variable interest rate or a fixed rate offered by our bank 
if the tax exempt bond acquisition described above occurs  we will make quarterly  interest only payments on the related  debt for ten years followed by a single repayment of principal at the end of the ten year loan period 
for the debt outstanding under the existing credit agreement  we will make quarterly  interest only payments through march  commencing on march   we will make quarterly principal and interest payments over the remaining nine years of the ten year loan period 
the outstanding debt will be  if the tax exempt bond acquisition described above occurs and  if the tax exempt bond acquisition described above does not occur 
to provide credit support for the agreement  we granted a second mortgage to our bank on the land and building where our present headquarters are located  as well as on improvements  certain equipment  and other tangible personal property 
the second mortgage will automatically convert to a first mortgage upon payment in full of our industrial development authority bonds  which payment we expect to occur during the first quarter of in the credit agreement  we agreed to limit our total outstanding debt to  after using a portion of the proceeds to repay existing debt  our total debt outstanding will be approximately  at any time after the fourth year of the loan period  or if we fail to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least  the bank has the option to require additional collateral from us in the form of a letter of credit or a security interest in certain cash and short term investments 
montgomery county pennsylvania ida bonds in  we issued  through the montgomery county pennsylvania industrial development authority   of taxable and tax exempt bonds  of which  remains outstanding as of december  as mentioned above  we expect during the first quarter of to pay in full the outstanding loan balance of the taxable bonds and to have our bank acquire and reissue the tax exempt bonds 
the bonds were 
table of contents issued to finance the purchase of our headquarters building and the construction of a pilot scale manufacturing facility within our building 
the bonds are supported by an aa rated letter of credit  and a reimbursement agreement between our bank and the letter of credit issuer 
the interest rate on the bonds varies weekly  depending on market rates for aa rated taxable and tax exempt obligations  respectively 
during  the weighted average  effective interest rate was per year  including letter of credit and other fees 
the terms of the bond issuance provide for monthly  interest only payments and a single repayment of principal at the end of the twenty year life of the bonds 
however  under our agreement with our bank  we make monthly payments to an escrow account to provide for an annual prepayment of principal 
as of december   we had restricted funds relating to the taxable bonds of  which consisted of our monthly payments to an escrow account plus interest revenue on the balance of the escrow account 
during the first quarter of  we expect to use the restricted funds and a portion of the proceeds under the credit agreement we entered into in january to pay in full the outstanding balance of the taxable bonds 
to provide credit support for this arrangement  we granted a first mortgage on the land  building  improvements  and certain machinery and equipment to our bank 
we also agreed to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least two times the outstanding loan balance 
if we fail to comply with this requirement  we are required to deposit with the lender cash collateral up to  but not more than  the unpaid balance of the loan 
at december   we were required to maintain  of cash and short term investments 
arrangements in december  we borrowed approximately  to finance the purchase of equipment  which collateralize the amount borrowed 
the terms of the financing require us to pay monthly principal and interest payments over months at an interest rate of 
during  we will be required to make principal and interest payments totaling  under this agreement 
in november  we entered into a capital lease for  of equipment 
the terms of the lease require us to make monthly payments over months 
during  we will be required to make payments totaling  under this agreement 
capital expenditures during   and  we purchased   and  respectively  of property  equipment  and building improvements 
in addition  during and we entered into capital lease obligations for assets with aggregate book values of  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures during and consisted largely of the two following facility improvement projects we completed construction in of a pilot manufacturing facility at our headquarters location for the production of enzymes and sugar nucleotides at commercial scale in accordance with applicable us food and drug administration s current good manufacturing practices regulations 
the facility comprises approximately  square feet of processing areas and  square feet of utility space 
it has bacterial and fungal fermentation capabilities and houses two  liter fermenters 
we expended approximately  for this project  of which  and  were expended in and  respectively 
we entered into a lease agreement in for a  square foot building  which we intended to convert into laboratory and office space 
later in  we suspended plans to complete these renovations 
in november  we reinitiated renovation activities at an expected additional cost of  which is incremental to  previously invested in these renovations  on approximately  square feet of the facility  leaving approximately  square feet available for future expansion 
our construction in progress at december  and includes  and  respectively  in renovations to this facility 
in january  we borrowed  from a bank for the purpose of funding these improvements 
see long term debt other arrangements credit agreement in the liquidity and capital resources section of this form k for a description of the material features of this borrowing 

table of contents in  we expect our investment in capital expenditures to be approximately million  which includes the impact of resuming the facility renovations described above 
in addition to the credit agreement described above  we may finance some or all of these capital expenditures through capital leases or the issuance of new debt or equity 
if we issue new debt  we may be required to maintain a minimum cash and investments balance  or to transfer cash into an escrow account to collateralize some portion of the debt  or both

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a focuses on our liquidity  capital resources  and financial statements 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are developed and adjusted periodically by management based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our summary of significant accounting policies is described in note to our financial statements included in item of this form k 
management considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this md a 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
our history of negative operating cash flows is an indicator of impairment 
accounting standards require that if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a company s long lived asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the reported value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the recognized impairment would be calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the reported value of the asset 
valuation of acquired intellectual property the carrying value of acquired intellectual property acquired ip on our balance sheet as of december  was million 
we reviewed our acquired intellectual property acquired ip for impairment as of december  because the undiscounted sum of the estimated future cash flows from the acquired ip exceeded the carrying value  we have not recognized an impairment 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment of our acquired ip is a critical accounting estimate because the accounting estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to estimate future cash flows over the life of our acquired ip by making assumptions about the timing and probability of our success in entering into new collaborations  and developing and commercializing products that incorporate our technologies  either directly or with collaborators  and the recognition of an impairment would have a material impact on the assets reported on our balance sheet as well as our net loss 
management s assumptions underlying the estimate of cash flows require significant judgment because we have limited experience in entering into collaborations with others to develop products incorporating our technologies 
in addition  we have limited experience in developing products incorporating our technologies and we have no experience in commercializing any products 
in estimating the impact of future collaborations  we have made assumptions about the timing of entering into collaborations for potential products  most of which we are not yet developing 
we have used data from public and private sources to estimate the types of cash flows that would occur at various stages of development for each product 

table of contents as of december   we estimate that our future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  related to acquired ip are greater than the current carrying value of the asset 
any decreases in estimated future cash flows could have an impact on the carrying value of the acquired ip 
if we had determined the acquired ip to be fully impaired as of december   total assets would have been reduced by and net loss would have been increased by 
valuation of property and equipment our property and equipment  which have a carrying value of million as of december   have been recorded at cost and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets 
approximately million of the carrying value represents the cost and  we believe  the fair value of construction in progress 
we believe the remaining property and equipment carrying value of million does not exceed its fair value 
valuation of investment in convertible preferred stock in  we made an investment of  in convertible preferred stock of neuronyx  inc  and entered into a research and development collaboration with neuronyx for the discovery and development of drugs for treating parkinson s disease and other neurological diseases 
we recorded the equity investment at cost 
in october  neuronyx informed us that they had completed an equity financing  under which other neuronyx investors have an aggregate liquidation preference that is senior to our liquidation preference and exceeds the post money valuation of neuronyx 
as a result  we reduced the carrying value of our equity investment to zero as of september  by recording a non cash charge  which is reflected as an impairment of equity securities in our statements of operations 
revenue recognition our revenue from collaborative agreements consists of upfront fees  research and development funding  and milestone payments 
we recognize revenues consistent with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab was issued by the securities and exchange commission in december  and updates the guidance from staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
non refundable upfront fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement  but the actual performance period may vary 
we adjust the performance periods based on available facts and circumstances 
periodic payments for research and development activities are recognized over the period that we perform those activities under the terms of each agreement 
revenue resulting from the achievement of milestone events stipulated in the agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved 
milestones are based on the occurrence of a substantive element specified in the contract or as a measure of substantive progress towards completion under the contract 
in november  we entered into two research  development and license agreements with novo nordisk a s to use our glycopegylation technology to develop three next generation proteins within novo nordisk s therapeutic areas  one of which is currently marketed by them 
under the terms of the new agreements  we received a non refundable  upfront fee of  as required under sab  we deferred the upfront fee and will amortize this amount over an expected performance period of five years 
our estimate of the performance period is a critical accounting estimate because the accounting estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because the estimate depends on the preclinical and clinical progress of the three next generation proteins  and a change in the expected performance period could have a material impact on the deferred revenue reported on our balance sheet as well as our net loss 

table of contents stock based employee compensation we apply apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations in accounting for all stock based employee compensation 
we record deferred compensation for option grants to employees for the amount  if any  by which the market price per share exceeds the exercise price per share 
we amortize deferred compensation over the vesting periods of each option 
we have elected to adopt only the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no

revenue from collaborative agreements 
revenues from collaborative agreements decreased to  in from  in our revenues from collaborative agreements have historically been derived from a few major collaborators 
our collaborative agreements provide for some or all of the following elements upfront fees  research and development funding  milestone revenues  and royalties on product sales 
in november  we entered into two research  development and license agreements with novo nordisk a s 
under the terms of the new agreements  we received a non refundable  upfront fee of  as required under sab  we deferred the upfront fee and will amortize this amount over an average expected performance period of five years 
during the year ended december   novo nordisk accounted for  of our revenues  of which  represented amortization of the upfront fee 
during and  wyeth accounted for revenues of  and  respectively 
our collaboration with wyeth pharmaceuticals was terminated in september  and we expect to receive no further revenues under this agreement 
during  we completed activities related to our wyeth nutrition collaboration and recorded as revenue the last scheduled payment for research and development funding of  which we received in october separately  we recognized revenue during of  under a license agreement 
because our revenues could be substantially affected by entering into new collaborations and on the financial terms of any new collaborations  we cannot estimate our revenues 

table of contents research and development expense 
in january  we announced the selection of an improved erythropoietin epo as the target for our first proprietary drug development project 
epo is prescribed to stimulate production of red blood cells  and is approved for sale in major markets around the world for the treatment of anemia associated with oncology chemotherapy  end stage renal disease  and chronic renal insufficiency 
based on proof of concept data  we believe it is feasible to develop a long acting epo through glycopegylation 
we expect to complete various preclinical activities during the first half of  and our goal is to initiate clinical trials by the end of in october  we announced the selection of an improved granulocyte colony stimulating factor g csf as the target for our second proprietary drug development project 
g csf is prescribed to stimulate production of neutrophils a type of white blood cell  and is approved for sale in major markets around the world for treatment of neutropenia associated with oncology chemotherapy 
based on proof of concept data  we believe it is feasible to develop a long acting g csf through glycopegylation 
we are planning to continue various preclinical development activities during  with the goal of initiating clinical trials by the end of we are working in collaboration with novo nordisk to incorporate our technology in three next generation versions of marketed proteins  one of which is currently marketed by novo nordisk 
we are also conducting exploratory research  both independently and with collaborators  to identify proteins that are likely candidates for development using our technologies  which may be advanced for development through our own proprietary drug program or through our partnering and licensing program 
we are continuing some work on the development of our other programs  including new applications of our glycopegylation and glycoconjugation technologies 
our current research and development projects are divided between two categories i glycoadvance and glycopegylation and ii other glycotechnology programs  which includes projects investigating other applications of our intellectual property 
we are exploring the most cost effective means of continuing some of the projects classified as other glycotechnology programs 
the following chart sets forth our projects in each of these categories and the stage to which each has been developed development stage status glycoadvance and glycopegylation improved erythropoietin improved granulocyte colony stimulating factor other protein projects preclinical preclinical research active active active other glycotechnology programs non protein therapeutic applications research active nutritional applications n a evaluating outlicensing opportunities for each of our research and development projects  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials  and supplies for each project 
we may also incur third party costs related to these projects  such as contract research  consulting and preclinical development costs 
indirect expenses include depreciation expense and the costs of operating and maintaining our facilities  property  and equipment  to the extent used for our research and development projects  as well as the costs of general management of our research and development projects 
our research and development expenses increased to  in from  in we expect our research and development expenses to be significantly greater in than they were in  as a result of the development  preclinical and clinical activities we plan to conduct during the year 
the following table illustrates research and development expenses incurred during and in each period for our significant groups of research and development projects in thousands 
year ended december  glycoadvance and glycopegylation other glycotechnology programs indirect expenses 
table of contents glycoadvance and glycopegylation our glycoadvance and glycopegylation research and development expenses increased during  compared to  primarily due to increased preclinical development costs associated with our improved epo  purchases of laboratory services and research supplies  including proteins  and the reallocation of resources from our other glycotechnology programs 
other glycotechnology programs research and development expenses related to our other glycotechnology programs decreased during  compared to  consistent with our decision during to focus our resources on our glycoadvance and glycopegylation programs 
indirect expenses our indirect research and development expenses increased during  compared to  primarily due to increases related to depreciation of pilot manufacturing facility improvements  which were placed in service in january  additional personnel  and the purchase of more supplies and outside services than in substantially offsetting these increases was a reduction in severance expense during of  of which  was a non cash charge  related to an agreement entered into during the first quarter of with one of our former executive officers 
the process of bringing drugs from the preclinical research and development stage through phase i  phase ii  and phase iii clinical trials and fda approval is a time consuming and expensive process 
because our announced product candidates are currently in the preclinical stage and there are a variety of potential intermediate clinical outcomes that are inherent in drug development  we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and costs we will incur to complete these research and development projects 
in addition  the timing and costs to complete our research and development projects will be affected by the timing and nature of any collaboration agreements we may enter into with a third party  neither of which we can currently estimate 
material cash inflows from proprietary drug development projects are highly uncertain  and we cannot reasonably estimate the period in which we will begin to receive material net cash inflows from our major research and development projects 
cash inflows from development stage products are dependent on several factors  including entering into collaborative agreements  the achievement of certain milestones  and regulatory approvals 
we may not receive milestone payments from any existing or future collaborations if a development stage product fails to meet technical or performance targets or fails to obtain the required regulatory approvals 
further  our revenues from collaborations will be affected by the level of efforts committed and made by our collaborative partners 
even if we achieve technical success in developing drug candidates  our collaborative partners may not devote the resources necessary to complete development and commence marketing of these products or they may not successfully market potential products 
marketing  general and administrative expense 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the corresponding period in the period contained higher consulting expenses and costs associated with executive recruitment and relocation than the comparable period 
the decreases in those expenses during were partly offset by increases in payroll 
during  we expect our marketing  general and administrative expenses to increase by less than over 
table of contents other income and expense 
during the year ended december   we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  relating to our investment in series a convertible preferred stock of neuronyx  inc we recorded the equity investment  which was made in  at cost 
in october  neuronyx informed us they were nearing completion of a series c equity financing  under which series c and series b neuronyx investors would have an aggregate liquidation preference that is senior to the series a liquidation preference and exceeds the assumed post money valuation of neuronyx 
as a result  we reduced the carrying value of our equity investment to zero as of september  by recording the non cash impairment charge 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of other income upon receipt from genzyme general of a contract payment  which was due as a result of the restructuring of our agreement with novazyme pharmaceuticals  inc in march in september  genzyme acquired novazyme  and assumed novazyme s contractual obligation to us 
we did not recognize any other income during interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the corresponding period in the decrease was due to lower average cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  as well as lower interest rates  during our interest income during is difficult to project  and will depend largely on prevailing interest rates and whether we complete any collaborative agreements and any additional equity or debt financings during the year 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to zero for the corresponding period in in  we capitalized  of interest expense on our two capital construction projects  as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
in accordance with gaap  we recognized capitalized interest for these projects only to the extent of our actual interest expense  resulting in no reported interest expense for we expect our interest expense during to increase due to our entering into an agreement in january to borrow up to  all of which we expect to borrow during the first quarter of see long term debt other arrangements credit agreement in the liquidity and capital resources section of this form k for a description of the material features of this debt financing

revenues from collaborative agreements increased to  in from  in the increase in revenues during was primarily a result of our wyeth pharmaceuticals collaboration  which was terminated in the third quarter of of the increase   was non cash  and represented the remaining amortization of the upfront fee that wyeth paid in december as required under sab  we deferred the upfront fee and began to amortize this amount as revenue over the expected performance period of the wyeth agreement 
upon termination of the wyeth agreement  the unamortized portion of the upfront fee was recognized as revenue

marketing  general and administrative expense 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the corresponding period in the period contained higher personnel costs including payroll  recruiting  and relocation  legal  and consulting expenses than the comparable period  which increases resulted primarily from recruiting of senior executives and focusing our business on the development of next generation proprietary protein therapeutics

table of contents factors affecting the company s prospects risks related to development stage company if we fail to obtain necessary funds for our operations  we will be unable to maintain and improve our technology position and we will be unable to develop and commercialize our therapeutic proteins 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through proceeds from the public and private placements of equity securities 
we have also funded our operations to a lesser extent from proceeds from property and equipment financing  interest earned on investments  revenues from corporate collaborations and gains from the sale of investments 
we believe that our existing cash and short term investments  expected revenue from collaborations and license arrangements  anticipated financing of capital expenditures  and interest income should be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements into our present and future capital requirements depend on many factors  including the level of research and development investment required to develop our therapeutic proteins and improve our technology position  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  which can be unpredictable in drug development  the cost of obtaining or manufacturing protein  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability and willingness to enter into new agreements with collaborators and to extend our existing collaborations  and the terms of these agreements  our success rate or that of our collaborators in preclinical and clinical efforts associated with milestones and royalties  the timing  willingness  and ability of our collaborators to commercialize products incorporating our technologies  the costs of recruiting and retaining qualified personnel  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  our need or decision to acquire or license complementary technologies or new drug targets  and changes in product candidate development plans that may be needed to address any difficulties in clinical studies or during commercialization 
we will require significant amounts of additional capital in the future  and we do not have any assurance that funding will be available when we need it on terms that we find favorable  if at all 
we may seek to raise these funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  credit facilities  or through corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders percentage ownership will be reduced and they may experience substantial dilution 
we may also issue equity securities that provide for rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities  these debt securities would have rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of our common stock  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
if we enter into a credit facility  the agreement may require us to maintain compliance with financial covenants and restrict our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  make redemptions or repurchases of capital stock  make loans  investments 
table of contents or capital expenditures  or engage in other activities 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or drug candidates  or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of opportunities  develop products or technologies  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or limited  and we may need to downsize or halt our operations 
we have a history of losses  and we may incur continued losses for some time 
we have incurred losses each year  including net losses of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  given our planned level of operating expenses  we expect to continue incurring losses for some time 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
to date  we have derived substantially all of our revenue from corporate collaborations  license agreements  and investments 
we expect that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will result from these sources and from the licensing of our technologies 
we also expect to spend significant amounts to expand our research and development on our proprietary drug candidates and technologies  maintain and expand our intellectual property position  expand our manufacturing scale up activities  and expand our business development and commercialization efforts 
we may continue to incur substantial losses even if our revenues increase 
in  we expect our investment in capital expenditures to be approximately million 
in addition to the credit agreement we entered into in january  we may finance some or all of these capital expenditures through capital leases or the issuance of new debt or equity 
our level of operating expenditures will vary depending upon the stage of development of our proprietary proteins and the number and nature of collaboration agreements into which we enter 
we have not yet commercialized any products or technologies  and we may never become profitable 
we have not yet developed any products or commercialized any products or technologies  and we may never be able to do so 
since we began operations in  we have not generated any revenues  except for interest income and revenues from collaborative agreements and investments 
we do not know when or if we will complete any of our product development efforts  receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates  or successfully commercialize any approved products 
even if we are successful in developing products that are approved for marketing  we will not be successful unless our products  and products incorporating our technologies  gain market acceptance 
the degree of market acceptance of these products will depend on a number of factors  including the receipt of regulatory approvals in the countries  and for the uses  we seek  the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the safety and clinical efficacy of our products and their potential advantages over existing therapeutic products  the adequacy and success of distribution  sales and marketing efforts  and pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  such as insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators 
physicians  patients  payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept  utilize or recommend any of our products or products incorporating our technologies 
as a result  we are unable to predict the extent of future losses or the time required to achieve profitability  if at all 
even if we or our collaborators successfully develop one or more products that incorporate our technologies  we may not become profitable 

table of contents risks related to development of products and technologies we have limited product development and manufacturing experience  and we may be unable to develop therapeutic proteins and commercialize our technologies 
until recently  we have not focused on the development of our own proprietary products 
we are now seeking to use our glycoadvance and glycopegylation technologies to develop proprietary next generation proteins  generally in collaboration with a partner 
our technologies may not result in the successful modification  optimization or development of proteins that are safe or efficacious 
because the development of new pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain  our technologies may not produce any commercially successful proteins 
if we fail to successfully obtain protein supplies on reasonable terms or modify the proteins we select for development  we will not be able to commercialize our next generation drug candidates  and our customers may not be able to develop drug candidates incorporating our technologies 
to date  we have manufactured only small quantities of our enzymes  sugar nucleotides and other reagents 
we intend to manufacture these reagents for use in our proprietary product development programs and for use by our collaborators 
our success depends on our ability to manufacture these compounds on a commercial scale  at reasonable cost  and in accordance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  prescribed by the us food and drug administration  or fda 
we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of the products we develop  even to meet our needs for pre clinical or clinical development  and we may have problems complying  or maintaining compliance  with cgmp 
in addition to the normal scale up risks associated with any manufacturing process  we may face unanticipated problems unique to the manufacture of enzymes  sugar nucleotides  other reagents  or proteins 
if we are unable to develop commercial scale manufacturing capacity  we would seek collaborators  licensees  or contract manufacturers to manufacture the compounds necessary to commercialize our technologies 
we may not be able to find parties willing and able to manufacture these compounds at acceptable prices 
any manufacturing facility must adhere to the fda s evolving regulations on cgmp  which are enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
the manufacture of products at any facility will be subject to strict quality control  testing  and record keeping requirements  and continuing obligations regarding the submission of safety reports and other post market information 
ultimately  we or our contract manufacturers may not meet these requirements 
if we encounter delays or difficulties in connection with manufacturing  commercialization of our products and technologies could be delayed  or we could breach our obligations under our collaborative agreements 
our success depends on our ability  and the ability of our partners  to meet the challenges of protein drug development 
the development of protein drugs involves a range of special challenges at various stages of the process 
in the preclinical phase of product development  we and our partners will face several potential problems  including obtaining supplies of the recombinant protein on commercially reasonable terms  successfully remodeling the native protein using our glycoadvance and glycopegylation technologies  and achieving adequate yields of the next generation protein 
we also may have to address difficult issues  such as protein refolding problems and contamination  which could delay or stop our progress 
if we cannot obtain native proteins or do not succeed in developing and scaling up our processes to enable the production of sufficient supplies of protein for large clinical trials or commercialization  in each case  at a commercially reasonable cost and on schedule  our programs could be significantly delayed or discontinued 
product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail in clinical trials for several reasons  such as results indicating that the product candidate is less effective than desired eg  the trial failed to meet its primary objectives or that it has harmful or problematic side effects 
even if clinical trials are successful  problems can arise later during commercialization 
we are aware that one marketed epo product was associated with pure red cell aplasia in post marketing surveillance studies 
this highlights the fact that even after a product is approved for marketing  problems may arise which can negatively affect sales and increase costs 

table of contents our failure to solve any of these problems could delay or prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technologies and could negatively impact our business 
our success depends on the success of our collaborative relationships and the success of our collaborators 
we will be relying to a large extent on collaborative partners to co develop our products and to commercialize products made using our technologies 
we do not anticipate continuing the development of our proprietary drug candidates beyond early phase ii studies unless we have a corporate partner 
we anticipate that substantially all of our revenues during the next several years will continue to be generated from collaboration or license agreements 
our partnering strategy entails many risks  including we may be unsuccessful in entering into collaborative agreements for the co development of our products or the commercialization of products incorporating our technologies  we may not be successful in adapting our technologies to the needs of our collaborative partners  our collaborators may not be successful in  or may not remain committed to  co developing our products or commercializing products incorporating our technologies  our collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to incorporating our technologies into their products  our collaborators may seek to develop other proprietary alternatives to our products or technologies  our collaborators are not obligated to market or commercialize our products or products incorporating our technologies  and they are not required to achieve any specific commercialization schedule  our collaborative agreements are generally terminable by our partners on short notice  and continued consolidation in our target markets may limit our ability to enter into collaboration agreements  or may result in terminations of existing collaborations 
given these risks  there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts 
any of our present or future collaborators may breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner 
in addition  we may dispute the application of payment provisions under any of our collaborative agreements 
if any of these events occur or if we fail to enter into or maintain collaborative agreements  we may not be able to commercialize our products and technologies  and our prospects would be significantly harmed 
we may be exposed to product liability and related risks 
the use in humans of compounds developed by us or incorporating our technologies may result in product liability claims 
product liability claims can be expensive to defend  and may result in large settlements of claims or judgments against us 
even if a product liability claim is not successful  the adverse publicity  time  and expense involved in defending such a claim may interfere with our business 
we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses 

table of contents risks related to intellectual property infringing the patents of others could result in litigation and delay development of our proprietary products 
the failure to obtain or maintain adequate patents  and other intellectual property protection  could impact our ability to compete effectively 
our commercial success depends in part on avoiding infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
as we seek to develop next generation proprietary products  we will have to investigate the patent protection for our target proteins 
there have been significant litigation and interference proceedings regarding patent rights  and the patent situation regarding particular products is often complex and uncertain 
for example  with respect to epo  the target of our first development program  the status of issued patents is currently being litigated and may delay our ability to market an improved epo in the us as we choose other targets  we may face uncertainty and litigation could result  which could lead to liability for damages  prevent our development and commercialization efforts  and divert resources from our business strategy 
it is possible that we will not be aware of pending patent applications that are relevant to our product candidates  either because our searches do not find them or because they are not yet publicly available 
the cost of any litigation challenging our right to pursue our target proteins or technologies could be substantial 
others seeking to develop next generation versions of proteins  or the holders of patents on our target proteins  may have greater financial resources  making them better able to bear the cost of litigation 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop  manufacture  and market products  form strategic alliances  and compete in the marketplace 
the failure to obtain  maintain or protect patents and other intellectual property could impact our ability to compete effectively 
to compete effectively  we need to develop and maintain a proprietary position with regard to our own technologies  products and business 
legal standards relating to the validity and scope of claims in our technology field are still evolving 
therefore  the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights in our core technologies and products made using these technologies is also uncertain 
the risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents  we may be subject to interference proceedings  we may be subject to opposition proceedings in foreign countries  the claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection  we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  the patents licensed or issued to us or our customers may not provide a competitive advantage  other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us or our customers  other companies may independently develop similar or alternative technologies  or duplicate our technologies  other companies may design around technologies we have licensed or developed  and enforcement of patents is complex  uncertain and expensive 

table of contents we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any of our pending applications  and we cannot be certain that any of our issued patents will give us adequate protection from competing products 
for example  issued patents may be circumvented or challenged  declared invalid or unenforceable  or narrowed in scope 
in addition  since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that we were the first to make our inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions 
in the event that another party has also filed a patent application relating to an invention claimed by us  we may be required to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the us patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial uncertainties and cost for us  even if the eventual outcome were favorable to us 
it is also possible that others may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business 
as to those patents that we have licensed  our rights depend on maintaining our obligations to the licensor under the applicable license agreement  and we may be unable to do so 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding relating to our patents or applications  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
our ability to enforce our patent protection could be limited by our financial resources  and may be subject to lengthy delays 
if we are unable to effectively enforce our proprietary rights  or if we are found to infringe the rights of others  we may be in breach of our license agreements with our partners 
third parties from time to time may assert that we are infringing their patents  trade secrets or know how 
in addition  future patents may issue to third parties that our technology may infringe 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our partners against any such claims 
furthermore  parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief  which could effectively block our ability or our partners ability to further develop or commercialize some or all of our products or technologies in the us and abroad  and could result in the award of substantial damages 
if we are found to infringe  we may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such licenses at a reasonable cost  if at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such required license could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition to patents and patent applications  we depend upon trade secrets and proprietary know how to protect our proprietary technology 
we require our employees  consultants  advisors  and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to any other parties 
we require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us their ideas  developments  discoveries  and inventions 
these agreements may not  however  provide adequate protection for our trade secrets  know how  or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure 
international patent protection is uncertain 
patent law outside the us is uncertain  and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
we may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of foreign patents belonging to us or our competitors  which proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts 
finally  some of our patent protection in the us is not available to us in foreign countries due to the differences in the patent laws of those countries 
we may have to develop or license alternative technologies if we are unable to maintain or obtain key technology from third parties 
we have licensed patents and patent applications from a number of institutions 
some of our proprietary rights have been licensed to us under agreements that have performance requirements or other contingencies 
the failure to comply with these provisions could lead to termination or modifications of our rights to these licenses 
additionally  we may need to obtain additional licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties to facilitate development of our proprietary technology base 
if our existing licenses are terminated or if we are unable to obtain such additional licenses on acceptable terms  our ability to perform our own research and development and to comply with our obligations under our collaborative agreements may be delayed while we seek to develop or license alternative technologies 

table of contents risks related to competition if our competitors succeed in developing more effective or less costly products  we will may not be able to commercialize any next generation protein therapeutics 
our business is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
new developments in molecular biology  medicinal chemistry  and other fields of biology and chemistry are expected to continue at a rapid pace in both industry and academia 
our potential competitors include both public and private pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic institutions  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations which are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection 
a number of these competitors are working on the development of next generation protein therapeutics 
some of these competitors include maxygen  applied molecular evolution  nektar  enzon  human genome sciences  biorexis and alkermes 
other companies have programs focused on developing next generation or improved versions of epo and g csf  and some are already marketing improved versions of these products 
these companies include amgen  gryphon  transkaryotic therapeutics  human genome sciences  ariad and affymax 
other companies are active in this area  and we expect that competition will increase 
there are several companies that are engaged in glycobiology research 
these companies include crucell  glycart  glycofi and momenta 
compared to us  many of these companies have more financial  scientific  and technical resources  product development  manufacturing and marketing capabilities  experience conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of new products  and experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for products 
competitors may succeed in developing products and technologies that are more effective and less costly than ours and that would render our products or technologies  or both  obsolete or noncompetitive 
we know that other companies with substantial resources are working on the development of next generation proteins  and they may achieve better results in remodeling our target proteins or the target proteins of our potential collaborators 
competitors also may prove to be more successful in designing  manufacturing and marketing products 
if we are successful in developing our own drug candidates or versions of drugs that are no longer patented  we will compete with other drug manufacturers for market share 
if we are unable to compete successfully  our commercial opportunities will be diminished 
in addition  while there is no abbreviated regulatory pathway for follow on biologics  this possibility is under discussion in the us and other jurisdictions 
if an abbreviated regulatory process is adopted for the approval of follow on biologics in any major market  competition could increase in related segments of the therapeutic protein market 
we may be unable to retain key employees or recruit additional qualified personnel 
because of the specialized scientific nature of our business  we are highly dependent upon qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel  including our research and development team and our president and ceo  c 
boyd clarke 
the development of our business is dependent upon our management team s ability to evaluate collaboration opportunities and on our ceo s ability to focus the company s efforts 
our anticipated research and development efforts will require additional expertise and the addition of new qualified personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified management and research and development personnel in the pharmaceutical field 
therefore  we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
the loss of the services of existing personnel  as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific  
table of contents technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner  would harm our research and development programs  our ability to manage day to day operations  attract collaboration partners  attract and retain other employees  and generate revenues 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
risks related to government regulation we are subject to extensive government regulation  and we or our collaborators may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
the research  development  manufacture and control  marketing  and sale of our reagents and product candidates manufactured using our technologies are subject to significant  but varying  degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in the us and other countries 
pharmaceutical product candidates manufactured using our technologies must undergo an extensive regulatory approval process before commercialization 
this process is regulated by the fda and by comparable agencies in the eu and other countries 
the us and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials  require additional testing  delay or withhold registration and marketing approval  and mandate product withdrawals 
the specific risks of protein drugs may result in the application of more stringent regulatory requirements prior to approval of our product candidates 
even if regulatory approvals were obtained  our manufacturing processes would be subject to continued review by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
any later discovery of unknown problems with our products  products incorporating our technologies  or manufacturing processes could result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes  including potential withdrawal of the products from the market 
in addition  if regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate or the manufacture and control of our reagents  then we may not obtain necessary approvals to market and sell the product candidate or reagents 
neither we nor our collaborators have submitted any product candidates incorporating our technologies for approval to the fda or any other regulatory authority 
if any product candidate manufactured using our technology is submitted for regulatory approval  it may not receive the approvals necessary for commercialization  the desired labeling claims  or adequate levels of reimbursement 
any delay in receiving  or failure to receive  these approvals would adversely affect our ability to generate product revenues or royalties 
in addition  new governmental regulations may delay or alter regulatory approval of any product candidate manufactured using our technology  and could affect competition by making market entry easier for manufacturers of follow on biologics 
we cannot predict the impact of adverse governmental action that might arise from future legislative and administrative action 
third party reimbursement for our collaborators or our future product candidates may not be adequate 
even if regulatory approval is obtained to sell any product candidates incorporating our technologies  our future revenues  profitability  and access to capital will be determined in part by the price at which we or our collaborators can sell such products 
there are continuing efforts by governmental and private third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means 
we expect a number of federal  state  and foreign proposals to control the cost of drugs through governmental regulation 
we are unsure of the form that any health care reform legislation may take or what actions federal  state  foreign  and private payors may take in response to the proposed reforms 
therefore  we cannot predict the effect of any implemented reform on our business 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  such as medicare and medicaid in the us  private health insurers  and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products  particularly for indications for which there is no current effective treatment or for which medical care typically is not sought 
adequate third party coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product research and development 
inadequate coverage and reimbursement levels provided by government and third party payors for use of our or our collaborators products may cause these products to fail to achieve market acceptance and would cause us to lose anticipated revenues and delay achievement of profitability 

table of contents risks related to facilities  business interruption  and the environment the use of hazardous materials in our operations may subject us to environmental claims or liability 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  and radioactive compounds 
we conduct experiments that are quite common in the biotechnology industry  in which we use small quantities of chemical hazards  including those that are corrosive  toxic and flammable  and trace amounts of radioactive materials 
the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials cannot be entirely eliminated 
we do not maintain a separate insurance policy for these types of risks 
in the event of an accident or environmental discharge  we may be held liable for any resulting damages  and any liability could exceed our resources 
we are subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling  and disposal of these materials and specified waste products 
the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant 
destructive actions by activists or terrorists could damage our facilities  interfere with our research activities  and cause ecological harm 
activists and terrorists have shown a willingness to injure people and damage physical facilities  equipment and biological materials to publicize or otherwise further their ideological causes 
our operations and research activities  and services conducted for us by third parties  could be adversely affected by such acts 
any such damage could delay our research projects and decrease our ability to conduct future research and development 
damage caused by activist or terrorist incidents could also cause the release of hazardous materials  including chemicals  radioactive and biological materials  which could be costly to remediate and damaging to our reputation 
any significant interruption to our ability to conduct our business operations  research and development activities  or manufacturing operations could reduce our revenue and increase our expenses 
risks related to stock market our stock price may continue to experience fluctuations 
the market prices of securities of thinly traded biotechnology companies  such as ours  generally are highly volatile 
for example  in the past months  the price of our common stock reached a low of per share in october   and a high of per share in february  during the past months the price of our common stock has traded as low as per share in february   and as high as per share in january  in this market environment  the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such a sale might occur would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock  at least for the short term 
we have a number of investors who hold relatively large positions in our securities 
a decision by any of these investors to sell all or a block of their holdings of our common stock could cause our stock price to drop significantly 
the market also continues to experience significant price and volume fluctuations  some of which are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in recent years  the price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 
many factors could have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock  including preclinical and clinical trial results  product development delays  an announcement or termination of a collaborative relationship by us or any of our partners or competitors  developments relating to our patent position or other proprietary rights  
table of contents announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products  government regulations  public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or others  and general market conditions 
any litigation brought against us as a result of this volatility could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources  which could negatively impact our financial condition  revenues  results of operations  and the price of our common stock 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities in a fluctuating market  many or all of our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution  and if we need to raise capital by issuing equity securities at a time when our stock price is down  we may have difficulty raising sufficient capital to meet our requirements 
if any of the risks described in these factors affecting the company s prospects occurred  or if any unforeseen risk affected our performance  it could have a dramatic and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
foreign exchange risks changes in foreign currency exchange rates could result in increased costs 
we have entered into agreements denominated in euros  and  in the future  we may enter into agreements denominated in euros or other foreign currencies 
to date  we have not entered into any contracts to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in the future  depending upon the amounts payable under any such agreements  we may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk of unpredictable changes in these costs 
however  due to the variability of timing and amount of payments under any such agreements  foreign exchange contracts may not mitigate the potential adverse impact on our financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our holdings of financial instruments are comprised primarily of government agency securities 
all such instruments are classified as securities held to maturity 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities  while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum 
as of december   the marketable securities that we held consisted of obligations of u
