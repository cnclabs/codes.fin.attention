critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the useful lives of the assets are based upon management s expectations for the period of time that the asset will be used for the generation of revenue 
management periodically reviews the assets for changes in circumstances that may impact their useful lives 
impairment of long lived assets 
management periodically reviews property and equipment for impairment using historical cash flows as well as current estimates of future cash flows 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions that are subject to a high degree of judgment 
in addition  at least annually  or as circumstances dictate  management assesses the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets which requires assumptions regarding the future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the assets 
in determining fair value  the company relies primarily on discounted cash flow analyses that incorporates an investment horizon of five years and utilizes a risk adjusted discount factor 
if these assumptions change in the future  management may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company has classified the revenues  expenses and related assets and liabilities of four grady s american grill restaurants that were sold in fiscal and four grady s american grill restaurants that are held for sale  as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred assets will not be realized 
management has considered all available evidence both positive and negative  including the company s historical operating results  estimates of future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in estimating its deferred tax asset  management used its operating plan as the basis for a forecast of future taxable earnings 
management did not incorporate growth assumptions and limited the forecast to five years  the period that management believes it can project results that are more likely than not achievable 
absent a significant and unforeseen change in facts or circumstances  management re evaluates the realizability of its tax assets in connection with its annual budgeting cycle 
the company operates in a very competitive industry that can be significantly affected by changes in local  regional or national economic conditions  changes in consumer tastes  weather conditions and various other consumer concerns 
accordingly  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered by management to be realizable  more likely than not  could change in the near term if estimates of future taxable income change 
this could result in a charge to  or increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
other estimates 
management is required to make judgments and or estimates in the determination of several of the accruals that are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the following accruals are subject to a higher degree of judgment 
management uses estimates in the determination of the required accruals for general liability  workers compensation and health insurance 
these estimates are based upon a detailed examination of historical and industry claims experience 
the claim experience may change in the future and may require management to revise these accruals 
the company is periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management is required to assess the probability of any adverse judgments as well as the potential ranges of any losses 
management determines the required accruals after a careful review of the facts of each legal action and assistance from outside legal counsel 
the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in these matters 
management continually reassesses its assumptions and judgments and makes adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates that are described above 
for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report

in light of these disposals and the continued decline in sales and cash flow in its grady s american grill division  in the second quarter of fiscal  the company reviewed the carrying amounts for the balance of its grady s american grill restaurant assets 
the company estimated the future cash flows expected to result from the continued operation and the residual value of the remaining restaurant locations in the division and concluded that  in eight locations  the undiscounted estimated future cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the related assets 
accordingly  the company concluded that these assets had been impaired 
the company measured the impairment and recorded an impairment charge related to these assets aggregating  in the second quarter of fiscal  consisting of a reduction in the net book value of the grady s american grill trademark of  and a reduction in the net book value of certain fixed assets in the amount of  the impairment charge relating to continuing operations was  and the amount relating to discontinued operations was  in determining the fair value of the aforementioned restaurants  the company relied primarily on discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated an investment horizon of five years and utilized a risk adjusted discount factor 
in light of the continuing negative trends in both sales and cash flows  the increase in the pervasiveness of these declines amongst individual stores  and the accelerating rate of decline in both sales and cash flow  the company also determined that the useful life of the grady s american grill trademark should be reduced from to five years 
the company continues to pursue various management actions in response to the negative trend in its grady s business  including evaluating strategic business alternatives for the division both as a whole and at each of its restaurant locations

the improvement in the quick service segment was mainly due to improved margins in the company s grand rapids  michigan burger king market 
the company acquired these restaurants on october   and has implemented new procedures that have reduced food costs as a percentage of sales

the company s assessment of its ability to realize the net deferred tax asset was based on the weight of both positive and negative evidence  including the taxable income of its current operations 
the company believes the positive evidence includes the company s profitability in and  consistent historical profitability of its chili s  italian dining and burger king divisions  and the resolution of substantially all of its bagel related contingent liabilities 
the company believes the negative evidence includes the persistent negative trends in its grady s american grill division and the recent sales declines in its burger king division  and statutory limitations on available carryforward tax benefits

nonetheless  realization of the net deferred tax asset will require approximately million of future taxable income 
the company operates in a very competitive industry that can be significantly affected by changes in local  regional or national economic conditions  changes in consumer tastes  weather conditions and various other consumer concerns

quick service 
the quick service segment of the restaurant industry is a very mature and competitive segment  which is dominated by several national chains 
market share is gained through national media campaigns promoting specific sandwiches  usually at a discounted price 
the national chains extend marketing efforts to include nationwide premiums and movie tie ins 
during fiscal  the fast food hamburger segment of the restaurant industry generally experienced positive growth  however  fierce competition in the quick service segment negatively affected the company s burger king results 
to date in fiscal  the competition that prevailed in the latter part of fiscal has continued 
mcdonald s and wendy s promotional campaigns and new products have been successful in taking away market share from burger king 
the company believes that the introduction of appealing new products and improved promotional campaigns is a prerequisite to successfully competing for market share in the quick service segment 
full service 
the full service segment of the restaurant industry is also mature and competitive 
this segment has a few national companies that utilize national media efficiently 
this segment also has numerous regional and local chains that provide service and products comparable to the national chains but which cannot support significant marketing campaigns 
the company operates three restaurant concepts that compete in the full service segment 
during fiscal  the company experienced strong results in its chili s division 
these results were achieved by the application of the company s disciplined operating systems and successful marketing and menu strategies 
the company also believes that the results in its chili s division were aided by effective product and marketing support from the franchisor

the company has experienced significant competitive intrusion in the markets where it has italian dining restaurants 
the company expects the competitive pressures to continue in fiscal during fiscal  the results of the company s grady s american grill division did not meet the company s expectations 
the company believes that the results in this division were negatively affected by competitive intrusion in the company s markets and limitations in the company s ability to efficiently market its grady s american grill restaurants 
during fiscal  the company sold four restaurants 
the company plans to sell four more restaurants in fiscal the company will continue to consider opportunities to divest under performing or non strategic restaurants in fiscal the company expects the grady s american grill division s operating performance to continue to decline during fiscal income taxes 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred assets will not be realized 
management has considered all available evidence both positive and negative  including the company s historical operating results  estimates of future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
the company believes the positive evidence includes the historically consistent profitability of its chili s  italian dining and burger king divisions  and the resolution of substantially all of its bagel related contingent liabilities 
the company believes the negative evidence includes the persistent negative trends in its grady s american grill division and the recent sales declines in its burger king division 
the company is currently experiencing unusual uncertainty concerning whether  when and to what extent the recent sales declines in its burger king division will be reversed 
in estimating its deferred tax asset  management used its operating plan as the basis for a forecast of future taxable earnings 
management did not incorporate growth assumptions and limited the forecast to five years  the period that management believes it can project results that are more likely than not achievable 
absent a significant and unforeseen change in facts or circumstances  management re evaluates the realizability of its tax assets in connection with its annual budgeting cycle 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the company s principal sources and uses of cash dollars in thousands fiscal year ended october  october  october  net cash provided by operating activities    cash flows from investing activities acquisition of business  net of cash  purchase of property and equipment    purchase of other assets  proceeds from the sale of assets   cash flow from financing activities borrowings repayment of long term debt  net    purchase of common stock  loan financing fees repayment of capitalized lease cash provided by discontinued operations   the company requires capital principally for building or acquiring new restaurants  replacing equipment and remodeling existing restaurants 
during the three year period ended october   the company financed these activities principally using cash flows from operations  proceeds from the sale of assets and its credit facilities 
the company s restaurants generate cash immediately through sales 
as is customary in the restaurant industry  the company does not have significant assets in the form of trade receivables or inventory  and customary payment terms generally result in several weeks of trade credit from its vendors 
therefore  the company s current liabilities have historically exceeded its current assets 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was  compared to  in fiscal lower income from restaurant operations and changes in operating assets and liabilities that used cash were partially offset by the gain on the note receivable collection  a reduction in general and administrative costs and lower interest expense 
during fiscal  the company had  in capital expenditures in connection with the opening of new restaurants and the refurbishing of existing restaurants 
during fiscal the company opened three new full service restaurants and one quick service restaurant 
the company also replaced two existing quick service restaurant buildings with new buildings at the same locations and acquired two additional quick service restaurants in facilities leased from a related party

the company s average borrowing rate on october  was 
the revolving credit agreement is subject to certain restrictive covenants that require the company  among other things  to achieve agreed upon levels of cash flow 
under the revolving credit agreement the company s funded debt to consolidated cash flow ratio may not exceed and its fixed charge coverage ratio may not be less than on october  the company was in compliance with these requirements with a funded debt to consolidated cash flow ratio of and a fixed charge coverage ratio of as of and for the period ended october  the company s primary cash requirements in fiscal will be capital expenditures in connection with the opening of new restaurants  remodeling of existing restaurants  maintenance expenditures  and the reduction of debt under the company s debt agreements 
during fiscal  the company anticipates opening two or three full service restaurants 
the company does not plan to open any new quick service restaurants 
the actual amount of the company s cash requirements for capital expenditures depends in part on the number of new restaurants opened  whether the company owns or leases new units and the actual expense related to remodeling and maintenance of existing units 
while the company s capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to range from  to  if the company has alternative uses or needs for its cash  the company believes it could reduce such planned expenditures without affecting its current operations 
the company has debt service requirements of approximately  in fiscal  consisting primarily of the principal payments required under its mortgage facility 
the company anticipates that its cash flow from operations  together with the  available under its revolving credit agreement as of october   will provide sufficient funds for its operating  capital expenditure  debt service and other requirements through the end of fiscal as of october   the company had a financing package totaling  consisting of a  revolving credit agreement the bank facility and a  mortgage facility the mortgage facility  as described below 
the mortgage facility currently includes separate mortgage notes  with initial terms of either or years 
the notes have fixed rates of interest of either or 
the notes require equal monthly interest and principal payments 
the mortgage notes are collateralized by a first mortgage deed of trust and security agreement on the real estate  improvements and equipment on of the company s chili s restaurants nine of which the company mortgaged its leasehold interest and of the company s burger king restaurants three of which the company mortgaged its leasehold interest 
the mortgage notes contain  among other provisions  financial covenants which require the company to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least for each of six subsets of the financed properties 
the company was not in compliance with the required consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio for two of the subsets of the financed properties as of october  both of these subsets are comprised solely of burger king restaurants and had fixed charge coverage ratios of and 
the company sought and obtained waivers of these covenant defaults from the mortgage lenders through november  if the company is not in compliance with these covenants as of november   the company will most likely seek additional waivers 
the company believes it would be able to obtain such waivers but there can be no assurance thereof 
if the company is unable to obtain such waivers it is contractually entitled to pre pay the outstanding balances under one or more of the separate mortgage notes such that the remaining properties in the subsets would meet the required ratio 
however  any such prepayments would be subject to prepayment premiums and to the company s ability to maintain its compliance with the financial covenants in its bank facility 
alternatively  the company is contractually entitled to substitute one or more better performing restaurants for under performing restaurants such that the reconstituted subsets of properties would meet the required ratio 
however  any such substitutions would require the consent of the lenders in the bank facility 
for these reasons  the company believes that its rights to prepay mortgage notes or substitute properties may be impractical depending on the circumstances existing at the time 
on june   the company refinanced its bank facility with a  revolving credit agreement with jp morgan chase bank  as agent  and four other banks 
the bank facility is collateralized by the stock of certain subsidiaries of the company  certain interests in the company s franchise agreements with brinker and burger king corporation and substantially all of the company s personal property not pledged in the mortgage facility

the bank facility provides for borrowings at the adjusted libor rate plus a contractual spread which is as follows ratio of funded debt to cash flow libor margin greater than or equal to less than x but greater than or equal to less than x but greater than or equal to x less than x the bank facility also contains covenants requiring maintenance of funded debt to cash flow and fixed charge coverage ratios as follows maximum funded debt to cash flow ratio covenant fiscal q through q fiscal q through q q fiscal q through q q fiscal q through q thereafter fixed charge coverage ratio the company s funded debt to consolidated cash flow ratio may not exceed through the third quarter of fiscal and by the end of fiscal the company s funded debt to consolidated cash flow ratio on october  was 
to maintain the required ratios throughout fiscal  the company plans to continue to dispose of under performing restaurants  using the proceeds to reduce debt and to continue its efforts to optimize cash flow from its restaurant operations 
if the company does not maintain the required funded debt to consolidated cash flow ratio  that would constitute an event of default under the bank facility 
the company would then need to seek waivers from its lenders or amendments to the covenants

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
it nullifies the guidance in emerging issues task force  which recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date an entity committed itself to an exit plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company adopted the provisions of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the company s results 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company does not intend to adopt the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
however  the company early adopted the disclosure provisions in fiscal and included this information in note to the company s financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation was subsequently revised by the fasb in december fin r 
the objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company s interest in the vie is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if they occur 
fin r also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
fin r is effective for periods after june  for variable interest entities in which the company holds a variable interest it acquired before february  for entities acquired or created before february   this interpretation is effective no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march   except for those variable interest entities that are considered to be special purpose entities  for which the effective date is no later that the end of the first reporting period that ends after december  the company is still assessing the impact  if any  the interpretation will have on the company s financial statements 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s operations during the past several years 
increases in labor  food  and other operating costs could adversely affect the company s operations 
in the past  however  the company generally has been able to modify its operating procedures or increase menu prices to substantially offset increases in its operating costs 
many of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
although the company has been able to and will continue to attempt to pass along increases in labor costs through food and beverage price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increases can be reflected in its prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without diminishing  to some degree  customer spending at the company s restaurants
