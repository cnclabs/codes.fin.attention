item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis overview kerr mcgee corporation is one of the largest us based independent oil and gas exploration and production companies and the world s third largest producer and marketer of titanium dioxide pigment 
the company has three reportable business segments  oil and gas exploration and production  production and marketing of titanium dioxide pigment chemical pigment  and production and marketing of other chemicals chemical other 
the company s assets total approximately billion 
proved oil and gas reserves are approximately billion barrels of oil equivalent and the company s equity production capacity for titanium dioxide pigment is  tonnes per year 
for  revenues from continuing operations totaled billion  of which billion was generated by the company s oil and gas exploration and production operations and billion was generated by the company s chemical operations 
revenues for the exploration and production operations are generated primarily from the sale of crude oil and natural gas  as well as marketing revenues associated with the company s sale of nonequity gas 
revenues for the company s chemical operations are generated from the sale of titanium dioxide pigment and other chemical products 
an overview of each operating unit and certain other economic considerations are included below to provide background for the various discussions that will follow in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
a detailed discussion of each operating unit s business and properties is included in items and of this form k 
exploration and production the company s exploration and production business is primarily focused on finding and developing new oil and gas reserves 
the success of the company depends heavily on a successful exploration program 
as a benchmark  the company works to replace at least of its production each year through a combination of its drilling and development programs and tactical acquisitions 
during  kerr mcgee replaced of its worldwide production from continuing operations  of which resulted from replacement through the company s exploration program 
kerr mcgee has established a competitive average finding  development and acquisition cost of per barrel of oil equivalent boe and annual average production replacement of over the past five years  and remains focused on adding value to its reserve base 
the company faces many challenges in executing a successful exploration program  including obtaining accurate and reliable geological and geophysical data  understanding reservoir complexity  and inherent risks associated with deepwater exploration  among others 
consequently  a portion of the company s total exploration costs is dry hole cost for unsuccessful drilling activity 
the company works to mitigate these risks by attracting and retaining talented exploration and engineering personnel with wide ranging experience in its core exploration areas 
the company utilizes advanced technology to maximize the impact of its exploration efforts including both extensive geological and geophysical data acquisition and analysis as well as state of the art visualization interpretation techniques 
in addition  kerr mcgee maintains an extensive world wide acreage position which the company believes provides it with a significant competitive advantage in its effort to maintain and develop a high quality prospect inventory 
the company believes its prospect inventory is a key component in mitigating the inherent risk of its exploration program 
in addition  profitability and cash flows for exploration and production operations are heavily dependent on market prices for crude oil and natural gas  as well as production costs  taxation levels and other operating costs 
to mitigate uncertainties related to commodity price fluctuations  the company hedged the sales price of a substantial portion of its oil and gas sales 
the company has entered into additional hedge contracts for to maximize the predictability of its cash flows 
in addition to hedging  the company monitors its cost performance in an effort to maximize overall profitability and ensure its ability to compete within the industry 
in  the company completed a major divestiture program which was partially directed at reducing the overall production cost of its asset portfolio 
completion of this program contributed to a reduction in the company s per unit production costs 
changes in operating costs from year to year are discussed in the segment operations section below 
while the company s drilling program and subsequent development of successful projects generally yield attractive economic returns  they do require a substantial capital commitment 
an overview of historical capital spending  as well as a discussion of the capital spending budget  major projects and exploratory drilling program are included in the capital spending section of md a below 
on an ongoing basis  the carrying values of the company s oil and gas properties are evaluated for recoverability relative to their future cash flows 
likewise  reservoir performance and reserve quantities are periodically reviewed 
negative revisions to reserve quantities or negative changes in the market prices of crude oil and natural gas can adversely affect the company s estimates of future cash flows and may result in asset impairments 
because of the large capital investment required to develop oil and gas fields and the uncertain mineral resources associated with each field  asset impairment evaluations are common in the oil and gas industry and are indicative of projects for which previous capital investments are no longer recoverable under current economic conditions 
such impairments may occur in the future  however  the company cannot predict the timing or magnitude of future asset impairment charges 
chemical the chemical operating unit has focused its strategy on its titanium dioxide pigment operations 
as part of this strategic decision  the company continues to investigate divestiture options for the electrolytic business and plans to exit the forest products business by the end of when the lease on its only facility still in operation expires 
the profitability of the company s pigment operations is tied to consumption of  and demand for  titanium dioxide pigment  which generally follow global economic trends discussed in the operating environment and outlook section below 
the profitability of the company s pigment operations also depends on the company s ability to manage operating costs 
as part of its efforts to manage operating costs  the company closed its synthetic rutile plant in mobile  alabama  in june the mobile plant supplied a portion of the feedstock for the company s pigment plants in the united states  however  through ongoing supply chain initiatives  feedstock can now be purchased more economically than it could be manufactured at the mobile plant 
in connection with the shutdown  the company recorded after tax charges of million for severance  accelerated depreciation and other decommissioning expenses during chemical is working on technological advancements that will allow it to add plant capacity with low cost expansions to take advantage of future market growth 
as a result of these efforts  production began through a new high productivity oxidation line at the savannah  georgia  chloride process pigment plant in january this new technology is expected to result in low cost  incremental capacity increases through modification of existing chloride oxidation lines and should allow for improved operating efficiencies through simplification of hardware configurations and reduced maintenance requirements 
based on the future outcome of these technological advancements  the company may need to review its existing configuration at the savannah plant to optimize the plant s resources in relation to capacity requirements 
the company will evaluate the performance of the new high productivity line  analyze the implications on the capacity of existing assets and have a plan for reconfiguration  if any  by the latter part of if the new high productivity line performs as expected  the outcome of this review may result in the redeployment of certain assets to alternate uses and or the need to idle certain other assets 
if this occurs  the future useful life of such assets may be adjusted  resulting in the acceleration of depreciation expense 
the avestor joint venture was created by kerr mcgee and hydro quebec  one of north america s largest utilities  to commercialize and produce a lithium metal polymer battery 
the company s investment in the joint venture aligns core competencies with new business expansion opportunities 
commercial battery production and sales commenced in late to the telecommunications industry 
it is expected that production will continue to increase during avestor s unique technical and product offering capability is expected to create additional high market value opportunities in the utility and industrial power generation markets 
with market demand growing  the company anticipates sales to match plant capacity 
other economic considerations other challenges facing kerr mcgee include balancing its opportunities for growth with the company s desire to maintain a lower debt structure  reducing the company s overall cost structure to improve longer term profitability  managing ongoing and legacy environmental obligations  and maintaining the over funded status of its us qualified pension plan 
strategically  kerr mcgee has committed its focus to growing its exploration and production operations and improving the profitability of its titanium dioxide pigment business 
this has been achieved through selective acquisitions  the success of the company s exploration program and technological advancements 
at the same time  the company must balance the capital commitment required to grow its core operations with its goal of reducing the company s total debt burden to remain competitive and to increase financial flexibility 
discussions of the company s cash flow  liquidity and debt reduction plans in are included in the financial condition section below 
in the global marketplace  economic pressures continue and the economy is recovering more slowly than anticipated 
in order to remain competitive  the company has taken a disciplined approach in reviewing its cost structure and initiated a work force reduction plan during the third quarter of as a result of the program  the company s eligible us nonbargaining work force was reduced by approximately  or employees 
the reduction consisted of both voluntary retirements and involuntary terminations 
qualifying employees terminated under this program are eligible for enhanced benefits under the company s pension and postretirement plans  along with severance payments 
the program was substantially completed by the end of  with certain retiring employees staying into the first half of for transition purposes 
in connection with the work force reduction  the company took a pretax charge of million during  of which million was for curtailment and special termination benefits associated with the company s retirement plans and million was for severance related costs 
because of the nature of kerr mcgee s current and historical operations  the company has significant environmental remediation responsibilities and continues to provide reserves for these remediation projects 
during  the company expensed an additional million net of reimbursements for environmental costs and funded million of expenditures associated with its environmental projects 
a discussion of the status and circumstances surrounding these projects is included in the environmental matters discussion below 
with the substantial stock market losses experienced between and  many corporations are facing a significant financial challenge with respect to the funded status of their pension plans 
the company s us qualified pension plan remains over funded and estimated returns on plan assets continue to exceed the company s other periodic pension costs  generating a net periodic pension benefit of million in no contributions to the company s us qualified pension plan will be necessary in the critical assumptions used in measuring the company s pension and postretirement obligations and the sensitivity of the various estimates associated with the company s benefit plans are discussed in the critical accounting policies section below 
operating environment and outlook oil and gas exploration and production during  global geopolitical uncertainties affected investment decisions in the oil and gas industry 
however  these risks were mitigated by consistently strong oil and gas prices 
the near month futures price of west texas intermediate wti crude oil closed at or above per barrel for most of the year  and natural gas maintained an average price above per million british thermal units mmbtu during crude oil during  disruptions to crude oil production in venezuela and nigeria due to political unrest and ethnic violence  combined with uncertainties linked to the war in iraq  created global uncertainty about the reliability of crude oil supply 
us crude oil inventories began below the normal operating range resulting from a reduction in us imports due to a strike in venezuela and strong demand for distillates during the us heating season 
in january  opec announced plans to increase production by million barrels per day to compensate for the venezuelan shortfalls 
however  this increase was not enough to overcome a perceived shortfall in supply due to low us inventories and expectation of a war in iraq 
crude oil wti prices were near per barrel by the end of the first quarter 
following the onset of the iraqi war  prices fell sharply to approximately per barrel due to the war s short duration  coupled with increases in crude oil imports from saudi arabia and venezuela 
decreasing us domestic oil production  delays in iraqi oil production increases and the effect of opec s april production cut of million barrels per day resulted in wti crude futures prices recovering to above per barrel early in the third quarter 
prices generally remained at this level for the remainder of the year 
numerous factors are expected to influence the us crude oil market in oil production in nigeria  venezuela and iraq continued to recover  although not to full capacity 
opec s recent remarks concerning the intention to shift its strategy to revenue enhancement from market share protection could also impact crude oil markets 
finally  a continued rebound in global economies could absorb some oversupply 
natural gas higher trending natural gas prices in are the result of fundamental shifts in the natural gas supply and demand balance 
gas prices began the year at about per mmbtu and reached a high of more than per mmbtu during february due to storage levels falling to record lows 
this event heightened concerns regarding the decline of us gas supplies  and deliverability issues continued to underpin market activity throughout the year 
by fall  us gas storage volumes had recovered to comfortable levels  but fears of the previous winter s supply shortfall  as well as reports of declining domestic production  kept prices strong 
throughout summer and fall  natural gas prices remained above per mmbtu  maintaining a range of to per mmbtu until december  when seasonally cold winter weather began to push prices up towards per mmbtu 
the environment for us natural gas prices remains volatile and will be influenced by several factors  including the balance between supply and demand  weather patterns  the rate and development of liquefied natural gas imports  crude oil and distillate prices  and government policy 
to mitigate the above uncertainties related to price fluctuations  the company has entered into hedges covering approximately of expected worldwide crude oil and condensate production  and of the us natural gas production 
by ensuring greater predictability of cash flows to fund major exploration and capital programs  hedging enhances the company s ability to meet financial requirements 
details of the company s commodity hedging program are included in the market risks section below 
chemicals in the global titanium dioxide pigment industry  the company is the third largest producer and marketer and one of five companies that own chloride technology 
the chloride process produces a pigment with optical properties preferred by the paint  coatings and plastics industries 
in early  chloride technology accounted for of the company s gross pigment production capacity 
the remaining capacity is sulfate process production  which produces pigment used primarily in paper and specialty products 
titanium dioxide is a quality of life product  and its consumption follows general economic trends 
throughout  challenging business conditions existed for the company s chemical operations due to near recessionary conditions in europe  high energy prices  the effect of the sars epidemic on economic conditions in asia and continued weakness in the us manufacturing sector 
these economic forces placed pressure on product prices  overall product demand and profitability 
while overall global economic growth was stagnant to recessionary during the first half of  the last quarter of did begin to show improvement as observed in the leading us economic indicators and euro zone gdp 
general economic conditions are expected to improve in for north america and europe  with continued growth in the asian markets 
the strategy for kerr mcgee s chemical unit focuses on continued improvement in asset productivity  process and product capability  cost reductions  and providing superior products for market segment growth 
multiple initiatives are in place to capture new market growth through segmentation strategies that align products with customer needs  low cost plant expansions to increase volume capacity  continuous improvement programs to increase efficiency and lower operating costs  and technology based programs to improve product quality and lower costs 
results of consolidated operations net income loss and per share amounts for each of the years in the three year period ended december   were as follows millions of dollars  except per share amounts net income loss net income loss per share basic diluted the major variances in net income on an operating unit basis after income taxes are outlined in the table below 
the variances in individual line items in the consolidated statement of operations are explained in the section that follows 
favorable unfavorable variance versus versus millions of dollars net operating profit exploration and production chemical pigment chemical other net interest expense other income expense discontinued operations cumulative effect of accounting change net income the increase in exploration and production net operating profit is primarily due to a decrease in asset impairments of million in and net gains associated with assets held for sale of million in versus losses of million in the remaining million increase is due to the deferred tax effect of million resulting from a increase in the uk corporate tax rate for oil and gas companies  combined with lower production costs and depreciation and depletion expense and higher average realized sales prices for both crude oil and natural gas in  partially offset by lower oil and gas sales volumes and higher exploration expense 
the decline in chemical pigment net operating profit in is principally the result of plant closure and workforce reduction provisions totaling million and higher average per unit production costs  partially offset by higher pigment sales prices 
lower interest expense in is due to lower average debt outstanding and a slightly lower weighted average interest rate 
the negative variance for other income expense is mainly due to higher general and administrative costs  workforce reduction costs and lower net gains on the revaluation of nonoperating derivatives and trading securities  partially offset by lower litigation provisions and a gain on sale of devon energy corporation devon shares 
discontinued operations for all three years resulted from the company s decision in early to dispose of its exploration and production interests in indonesia and kazakhstan and its interest in the bayu undan project in the east timor sea offshore australia 
these divestiture decisions were made as part of the company s strategic plan to rationalize noncore oil and gas properties 
the negative variance from discontinued operations in and the positive variance in are both due primarily to the million gain on sale in related to the disposals in indonesia and australia 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is the result of the company s adoption of the financial accounting standards board s statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
see the new revised accounting standards section below for a discussion of the adoption 
the decline in exploration and production net operating profit resulted from asset impairments of million  losses associated with assets held for sale of million and the deferred tax effect of million for the uk corporate tax law change  as well as higher lease operating expense  shipping and handling expense  depreciation and depletion  and exploration expenses 
the improvement in chemical s pigment net operating profit in was principally the result of higher pigment sales volumes and lower average per unit production costs 
higher interest expense in was due to significantly higher average debt outstanding and lower capitalized interest  partially offset by a lower overall average interest rate 
the negative variance for other income expense was mainly due to the adoption of fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which resulted in the company recognizing a million net unrealized gain on shares of devon reclassified to trading from the available for sale category of investments 
additionally  a net of tax litigation provision of million and after tax foreign currency losses of million contributed to the other income expense variance for versus the positive variance from the change in accounting principle also resulted from the company s adoption of fas in this standard required the recording of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
kerr mcgee recorded the fair value of all its outstanding foreign currency forward contracts and the fair value of the options associated with the company s debt exchangeable for common stock decs of devon owned by the company 
the net effect of recording these fair values resulted in a million decrease in income as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and a million reduction in equity other comprehensive income for the foreign currency contracts designated as hedges 
statement of operations comparisons billions of dollars revenues the increase in revenues was primarily due to higher average realized sales prices for crude oil  natural gas and titanium dioxide pigment  combined with higher gas marketing sales revenue 
these increases were partially offset by lower production quantities due primarily to oil and gas properties divested during and revenues in increased slightly over due to a full year of revenues from the rocky mountain region compared with only five months in following the acquisition of hs resources  combined with the favorable impact of higher pigment sales volumes  partially offset by the recognition of lower revenues from properties divested during these variances are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of reclassifications made to revenues for and millions of dollars costs and operating expenses    costs and operating expenses for increased million over the prior year  primarily due to higher gas marketing product costs of million which offsets higher third party gas marketing revenues  higher pigment production costs of million and shutdown provisions of million associated with the closure of chemical s mobile facility and forest products operations 
these increases were partially offset by lower lease operating expense of million mainly due to oil and gas property divestitures 
costs and operating expenses increased million in from the level  resulting principally from higher gas marketing  gathering and pipeline costs of million full year of rocky mountain operations in versus five months in  higher lease operating expenses of million full year of rocky mountain operations and new natural gas production brought online in the gulf of mexico region  and higher pigment production cost of million increased pigment production volumes 
millions of dollars selling  general and administrative expenses for  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million over the prior year  resulting primarily from provisions totaling million associated with the work force reduction plan and other transition and severance related costs  together with additional compensation expense of million resulting from loan prepayments required to release shares from the company s employee stock ownership plan 
also contributing to the increase were higher corporate and exploration and production general and administrative costs of million and million  respectively  partially offset by lower litigation provisions of million prior year forest products litigation 
the increase in corporate general and administration was principally due to higher compensation related costs of million related mostly to performance bonus and amortization of restricted stock compensation  along with higher general and auto liability costs of million 
the increase in general and administrative costs for the exploration and production operations of million is due primarily to lower billings of costs on operated properties to partners  which were partially offset by lower cost for contract services and direct labor 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million primarily as a result of the million reserve for litigation established mainly in connection with certain forest products litigation in mississippi  louisiana and pennsylvania 
this litigation is discussed in note to the financial statements 
shipping and handling expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to higher costs for transportation from new deepwater fields in the gulf of mexico  including nansen  boomvang and navajo  and increased costs in the uk north sea  as well as higher pigment shipping costs 
the increase in pigment shipping costs is primarily related to higher ocean freight prices due to supply constraints on the availability of vessels 
the increase was also due to higher transportation for new deepwater fields in the gulf of mexico  combined with higher costs in the rocky mountain region due to a full year of costs related to the former hs resources operations 
abandonment expense of million and million associated with the company s exploration and production operations has been reclassified from costs and operating expenses to depreciation and depletion for and to be consistent with the presentation after adoption of fas millions of dollars depreciation and depletion depreciation and depletion expense totaled million in  million in and million in the decrease for is due to lower depletion expense for divested or held for sale properties of million and lower depletion on the leadon field of million  partially offset by higher depletion expense in the gulf of mexico region of million mainly due to higher production from the nansen  boomvang and navajo fields which began producing in the increase was due to higher depletion expense for the rocky mountain region of million full year of ownership and for the uk region of million 
partially offsetting these increases was lower expense in the gulf of mexico region of million due to normal declines in production and held for sale properties  which more than offset the impact of new production from the nansen  boomvang and navajo fields 
impairment losses on held for use assets totaled million in  million in and million in these impairments were related to assets with remaining investments that were no longer expected to be recovered through future cash flows 
impairments in were related primarily to various mature oil and gas fields in the us onshore and gulf of mexico shelf areas 
the impairments in included million for the leadon field in the north sea  million for certain nonoperated fields in the north sea  million for several older gulf of mexico shelf properties  and million related to the company s planned shutdown of the forest products operations 
the impairments were comprised of million associated with the shut down of the north sea hutton field and million for certain chemical facilities in belgium and the us during  the company selectively marketed its owned leadon field to third parties 
although no divestiture negotiations are currently under way  the company continues to review its options with respect to the field and  particularly  the associated floating production  storage and offloading fpso facility 
management presently intends to continue operating and producing the field until such time as the operating cash flow generated by the field does not support continued production or until a higher value option is identified 
given the significant value associated with the fpso relative to the size of the entire project  the company will continue to pursue a long term solution that achieves maximum value for leadon which may include disposing of the field  monetizing the fpso by selling it as a development option for a third party discovery  or redeployment in other company operations 
as of december   the carrying value of the leadon field assets totaled million 
given the uncertainty concerning possible outcomes  it is reasonably possible that the company s estimate of future cash flows from the leadon field and associated fair value could change in the near term due to  among other things  i unfavorable changes in commodity prices or operating costs  ii a production profile that declines more rapidly than currently anticipated  and or iii unsuccessful results of continued marketing activities or failure to locate a strategic buyer or suitable redeployment opportunity 
accordingly  management anticipates that the leadon field will be subject to periodic impairment review until such time as the field is abandoned or sold 
if future cash flows or fair value decrease from that presently estimated  an additional write down of the leadon field could occur in the future 
in connection with the company s divestiture program initiated in  certain oil and gas properties were identified for disposal and classified as held for sale properties 
upon classification as held for sale  the carrying value of the related properties is analyzed in relation to the estimated fair value less costs to sell  and losses are recognized  if necessary 
upon ultimate disposal of the properties  any gain or additional loss on sale is recognized 
losses of million and gains of million were recognized in upon conclusion of the divestiture program in the us and north sea  and for the sale of the company s interest in the south china sea liuhua field and other noncore us properties onshore and gulf of mexico shelf areas 
the company recognized losses of million in associated with oil and gas properties held for sale in the us onshore and gulf of mexico shelf areas  the us north sea and ecuador 
proceeds realized from these disposals totaled million in and million in the proceeds from the sale of such properties have been used to reduce long term debt 
from time to time  other oil and gas properties may be identified for disposal when such properties are considered noncore or nearing the end of their productive lives 
millions of dollars exploration expense exploration costs were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase was due to higher dry hole costs of million  primarily exploratory drilling in the deepwater gulf of mexico  and higher exploration department costs of million 
the increase was due to higher dry hole costs of million  mainly exploratory drilling in the deepwater gulf of mexico and in the north sea  higher nonproducing leasehold amortization of million  and higher geophysical costs of million 
interest and debt expense totaled million in  million in and million in the million decrease in was due to lower average borrowings under revolving credit facilities and commercial paper of approximately million and slightly lower average interest rates on the company s long term debt 
the million increase in was due to an annual average debt balance that was approximately billion higher than due to the acquisition of hs resources in august and capitalized interest that was lower by million  partially offset by overall average interest rates that were approximately lower than in the prior year 
other income expense includes the following for each of the years in the three year period ended december  millions of dollars foreign currency translation gain loss loss from equity affiliates gain on sale of devon stock unrealized gain on devon stock reclassified to trading category of investments exchangeable debt embedded options and devon stock revaluations gains losses on non hedge natural gas derivatives other other income expense the majority of the and foreign currency losses resulted from the company s uk operations  where the company has experienced unfavorable changes in the us dollar british pound sterling exchange rates 
the loss from equity affiliates for  and was primarily the result of the investment in the avestor joint venture formed in to develop new lithium metal polymer batteries 
the gain on sale of devon stock resulted from the sale of approximately million shares that were in excess of the total shares the company believes will be required to extinguish the debt exchangeable for common stock due in august the company sold its remaining devon shares in january for a pretax gain of million 
all other devon shares will be held through august in connection with the maturity of the debt exchangeable for common stock 
the effective tax rate for was  compared with in and in the effective rate is higher than the us statutory rate primarily due to the impact of taxation on foreign operations 
the tax benefit was reduced from the us statutory rate due to the deferred tax effect of million for the increase in the uk corporate tax rate for oil and gas companies  together with the impact of taxation on foreign operations 
segment operations operating profit loss from each of the company s segments is summarized in the following table millions of dollars operating profit loss exploration and production  chemicals pigment other total chemicals operating profit loss exploration and production revenues revenues  production statistics and average prices received from sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas are shown in the following table millions of dollars  except per unit amounts revenues crude oil and condensate sales    natural gas sales  gas marketing activities other total    production crude oil and condensate thousands of barrels per day natural gas mmcf per day total equivalent barrels of oil thousands of barrels per day average prices crude oil and condensate per barrel natural gas per mcf includes the results of the company s oil and gas commodity hedging program  which began in in  hedges reduced the average sales price of crude oil and natural gas sold by per barrel and 
per mcf  respectively 
in  hedge activity reduced the average sales price of crude oil and natural gas sold by per barrel and 
per mcf  respectively 
oil sales revenues declined million in compared with  primarily as a result of lower production due to the divestiture of various properties 
this decrease in oil production was partially offset by higher realized prices 
the average realized price for oil increased per barrel  adding million to oil revenues  while lower oil production reduced revenues by million 
the oil production decline was primarily due to the sale of various noncore properties during and the company began a divestiture program in mid to improve the overall quality of its asset portfolio  targeting high operating cost  noncore assets 
the program was completed in property sales were concentrated in the us onshore region  gulf of mexico shelf and the uk north sea  as well as ecuador and the south china sea 
after adjusting for divestitures  oil production was approximately the same as oil sales revenues for declined million compared with  primarily driven by lower realized prices of 
per barrel 
the oil production volumes remained relatively flat compared with natural gas sales revenues increased million in  primarily as a result of a per mcf increase in the average realized price for natural gas  partially offset by a decline in production volumes 
higher realized prices increased revenue by million  while lower gas production reduced revenues by million 
production declines resulted primarily from property divestitures concentrated mainly in the u 
s onshore and gulf of mexico shelf areas 
after adjusting for divestitures  gas production volumes declined by compared with natural gas sales revenue decreased million in compared with lower realized prices of 
per mcf resulted in a revenue decline of million that was partially offset by an increase of million due to higher sales volumes 
in  gas sales volumes increased or mmcf day over the levels  primarily due to a full year of gas production from the wattenberg field in colorado  which was acquired in august the variances in revenues from gas marketing activities are discussed in the gas marketing activities section below 
operating costs and expenses operating costs and expenses relating to the sale of crude oil  condensate and natural gas are shown in the following table 
millions of dollars lease operating expense production taxes total lifting costs transportation expense depreciation  depletion and amortization accretion expense abandonment obligations general and administrative expense exploration expense impairments on assets held for use loss gain associated with assets held for sale gas gathering  pipeline and other total operating cost and expenses    lease operating expense during  lease operating expense decreased or million compared with on a per unit basis  lease operating expense decreased by about to per barrel of oil equivalent boe sold in from per boe in lower costs were primarily related to the divestiture of noncore  high operating cost properties 
lease operating expense increased million in compared with  resulting in costs of and per boe  respectively 
higher lease operating expense in was the result of new production from the nansen and boomvang fields in the deepwater gulf of mexico and from a full year of production from the leadon field in the uk north sea  which commenced production in late a full year of operating expenses from the wattenberg field acquired in august also contributed to the increase 
production taxes during  production taxes decreased by million  primarily due to the elimination of royalty payments in the uk north sea area and lower production volumes 
these factors were partially offset by higher commodity prices as production taxes are generally based on sales revenue 
production taxes in decreased by million compared with as a result of lower commodity prices primarily natural gas prices  partially offset by higher sales volumes 
transportation expense transportation costs  representing the costs paid to third party providers to transport oil and gas production  increased million during transportation costs in reflected a million increase over levels 
the increase for both periods resulted from transportation costs associated with new deepwater gulf of mexico producing fields such as boomvang  nansen and navajo as well as increased costs in the u 
k north sea area 
in addition  transportation costs include a full year of costs associated with the wattenberg field 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense decreased million in  representing a decline compared with the decrease in dd a expense is primarily the result of production declines associated with the divestiture program that began in mid and asset impairments that were recorded in primarily the leadon field 
on a per unit basis  dd a increased to per boe in from per boe in although total dd a expense was lower  higher unit costs resulted from the company s divestiture activity and the overall mix of producing properties between and in accordance with accounting standards  depreciation was not recorded for various assets that were designated as held for sale in and  although production quantities for these properties continued to be included in the calculation of total unit dd a 
dd a expense in was million higher than in this increase was primarily due to higher production in on a per unit basis  dd a expense increased to per boe in from per boe in the increase in unit costs was due primarily to higher dd a rates for various new fields that were brought on production in late and  including the nansen and boomvang fields in the gulf of mexico as well as the leadon field in the uk north sea 
in addition  a full year of production from the wattenberg field acquired in august contributed to the increase 
accretion expense accretion expense of million in is related to the company s discounted abandonment liability recognized in as a result of implementing fas general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses were million higher in compared with this resulted from million of nonrecurring employee severance and related costs in associated with the company s work force reduction plan 
additionally  the company incurred higher costs associated with employee benefits and the pension plan  as well as lower billings of costs on operated properties to partners 
these costs were partially offset by lower costs for direct labor and contract services 
g a expense in was million higher than in  primarily as a result of higher contract services and increased labor and benefits costs 
exploration expense exploration expense in was million higher than in primarily as a result of higher dry hole costs from increased exploration activity during the year 
in addition  staffing levels were increased during to support the company s worldwide exploration efforts and continued development of the company s high potential prospect inventory 
exploration expense in increased million compared with the prior year primarily as a result of higher dry hole costs from increased exploration activity during the year 
in addition  higher amortization expense for nonproducing leaseholds and increased costs for geological and geophysical projects contributed to the increase 
impairments on held for use assets and the gain or loss on assets held for sale have been discussed in the statement of operations comparisons section above 
gas marketing activities in the rocky mountain region  kerr mcgee purchases third party natural gas for aggregation and sale with the company s own production from the wattenberg field in colorado 
in addition  kerr mcgee has purchased transportation capacity to markets in the midwest to facilitate sale of its natural gas outside the immediate vicinity of its production 
this activity began with the company s acquisition of hs resources in august and has increased since that time 
revenues from sale of third party gas and associated gas purchase cost relating to gas marketing activities are shown in the following table 
millions of dollars gas marketing revenues gas purchase costs including transportation net marketing margin marketing volumes thousand mmbtu day marketing revenues increased million in compared with primarily due to higher purchase and resale of natural gas in the rocky mountain area and higher natural gas prices 
gas purchase costs increased proportionately for the same period  an increase of million 
marketing revenues increased million in compared with  primarily as a result of a full year of marketing activity in the rocky mountain area after the hs resources acquisition

during the third quarter of  kerr mcgee chemical llc placed its electrolytic manganese dioxide emd manufacturing operation in henderson  nevada  on standby to reduce inventory levels because of the harmful effect of low priced imports on the company s emd business 
in response to the pricing activities of importing companies  kerr mcgee chemical llc filed a petition for the imposition of anti dumping duties with the us department of commerce international trade administration and the us international trade commission on july  in its petition  the company alleged that manufacturers in certain countries export emd to the united states in violation of the us anti dumping laws and requested that the us department of commerce apply anti dumping duties to the emd imported from such countries 
the department of commerce found probable cause to believe that manufacturers in the specified countries engaged in dumping and initiated an anti dumping investigation with respect to such manufacturers 
partly as a result of the anti dumping petition  demand for us emd product increased  and the plant resumed operations in december the company withdrew its anti dumping petition in february but will continue to monitor market conditions 
financial condition millions of dollars current ratio to to to total debt    total debt less cash net debt    total debt less cash and decs    stockholders equity    net debt to total capitalization total debt less cash and decs to total capitalization floating rate debt to total debt including fixed rate debt with interest rate swap to variable rate the negative working capital at the end of and is not indicative of a lack of liquidity as the company maintains sufficient current assets to settle current liabilities when due 
current asset balances are minimized as one way to finance capital expenditures and lower borrowing costs 
if needed  the company also has unused lines of credit and revolving credit facilities as discussed in the liquidity section that follows 
kerr mcgee operates with the philosophy that over a five year plan period the company s capital expenditures and dividends should be paid from cash generated by operations 
on a cumulative basis  the cash generated from operations for the past five years has exceeded the company s capital expenditures and dividend payments 
debt and equity transactions are utilized for acquisition opportunities and short term needs due to timing of cash flow 
percentages net debt to total capitalization net debt to total capitalization is total debt less cash divided by total debt less cash plus stockholders equity 
a reduction in net debt of million from  combined with an increase in stockholders equity of million resulted in a improvement in the percentage of net debt to total capitalization as compared to the company s goal is to reduce its percentage of net debt to total capitalization to or below by the end of although debt was reduced million from to  a decrease in equity resulting primarily from the net loss and dividends declared resulted in a slightly higher percentage of net debt to total capitalization in compared with cash flow millions of dollars cash flow from operating activities    cash flow from operating activities has increased significantly over the past two years 
cash flow from operating activities increased million  from billion in to billion in  primarily due to an increase in income excluding noncash items  partially offset by changes in various working capital items 
year end cash was million  compared with million at december  the company invested billion in its capital program  which included million of unsuccessful exploratory drilling costs 
the capital program for was million lower than in the prior year  resulting primarily from lower capital expenditures in the north sea  rocky mountain and us onshore regions  partially offset by higher capital expenditures in the gulf of mexico and china and higher dry hole costs 
during  the company completed the divestiture of several oil and gas properties and other assets  generating proceeds of million 
these proceeds were used primarily to pay down debt 
the company also invested million in selected oil and gas property acquisitions related to the acquisition of an additional interest in the uk gryphon and south gryphon fields and an onshore property acquisition in south texas 
cash outlays for investing activities include a million investment by the chemical unit in avestor  its lithium metal polymer battery joint venture in canada 
other investing cash inflows included million in proceeds related to the sale of devon stock

included in the total repayments of million is million related to open market repurchases of long term debt issuances on which the company recorded a loss of million for early extinguishment in other expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
however  by executing the open market repurchases  the company will avoid approximately million in future interest expense 
the company added million in debt at december   due to the consolidation of the kerr mcgee gunnison trust 
this synthetic lease arrangement was restructured to an operating lease arrangement in january  and the related debt will no longer be reflected on the company s balance sheet 
the consolidation  which resulted in a noncash increase in debt and property  is discussed in more detail in the off balance sheet arrangements section below 
cash flow was used to pay the company s dividends of million in as of december   the company s senior unsecured debt was rated bbb by standard poor s and fitch and baa by moody s 
see note for details of the company s debt 
at december   the company s outstanding debt had increased significantly from prior year levels to fund the acquisition of hs resources and major development projects in the gulf of mexico and the north sea 
throughout and  the company aggressively pursued its strategy of divesting noncore  high cost assets  the proceeds from which have been used primarily to reduce the company s outstanding debt 
the company expects to further reduce debt by approximately million during by using excess cash flows and by using devon common stock to repay the million face amount of debt exchangeable for devon common stock decs owned by the company 
liquidity the company believes that it has the ability to provide for its operational needs and its long and short term capital programs through its operating cash flow partially protected by the company s hedging program  borrowing capacity and ability to raise capital 
the company s primary source of funds has been from operating cash flow  which could be adversely affected by declines in oil  natural gas and pigment prices  all of which can be volatile as discussed in the preceding outlook section 
should operating cash flows decline  the company may reduce its capital expenditures program  borrow under its commercial paper program  draw upon revolving credit facilities and or consider selective long term borrowings or equity issuances 
kerr mcgee s commercial paper programs are backed by the revolving credit facilities currently in place 
should the company s commercial paper or debt rating be downgraded  borrowing costs will increase  and the company may experience loss of investor interest in its debt instruments as evidenced by a reduction in the number of investors and or amounts they are willing to invest 
at december   the company had unused lines of credit and committed amounts under revolving credit agreements totaling billion 
the company maintains two revolving credit agreements consisting of a five year million facility signed january   and a day million facility renewed on november  in addition  the company had other unused credit facilities of million at december  of the total of billion  million and million can be used to support commercial paper borrowings in the us and europe  respectively  by certain wholly owned subsidiaries and are guaranteed by the parent company 
the borrowings can be made in us dollars  british pound sterling  euros or local european currencies 
interest for each of the revolving credit facilities and lines of credit is payable at varying rates 
the company holds derivative financial instruments that require margin deposits if unrealized losses exceed limits established with individual counterparty institutions 
from time to time  the company may be required to advance cash to its counterparties to satisfy margin deposit requirements 
no margin deposits were outstanding at december  between january   and march   margin calls totaled million  however  these amounts have since been refunded to the company 
at december   the company classified million of its short term obligations as long term debt 
the company has the intent and the ability  as evidenced by committed credit agreements  to refinance this type of debt on a long term basis 
the company s practice has been to continually refinance its commercial paper or draw on its backup facilities  while maintaining borrowing levels believed to be appropriate 
the company issued notes exchangeable for common stock in august  which allow each holder to receive between 
and share of devon common stock or  at the company s option  an equivalent amount of cash at maturity in august as of february   devon common stock was trading at per share 
embedded options in the decs provide the company a floor price on devon s common stock of per share the put option 
the company also has the right to retain up to of the shares if devon s stock price is greater than per share the decs holders have an embedded call option on of the shares 
if devon s stock price at maturity is greater than per share but less than per share  the company s right to retain devon stock will be reduced proportionately 
the company is not entitled to retain any devon stock if the price of devon stock at maturity is less than or equal to per share 
using the black scholes valuation model  the company recognizes any gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the put and call options in other income 
the fluctuation in the value of the put and call derivative financial instruments will generally offset the increase or decease in the market value of the devon stock classified as trading 
the remaining devon shares  accounted for as available for sale securities  were partially liquidated in december  with the remaining shares sold in january the available for sale devon shares were in excess of the number of shares the company believes will be required to extinguish the decs  however  should the price of the stock fall below per share at the maturity of the decs  the company would be required to either purchase additional devon shares to settle the decs or settle a portion of the decs with cash 
the company also has available  to issue and sell  a total of billion of debt securities  common or preferred stock  or warrants under its shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission  which was last updated in february off balance sheet arrangements during and  the company identified certain financing needs that it determined would be best handled by off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated  special purpose entities 
three leasing arrangements were entered into for financing the company s working interest obligations for production platforms and related equipment at three company operated fields in the gulf of mexico 
also  the company entered into an accounts receivable monetization program to sell its receivables from certain pigment customers 
each of these transactions has provided specific financing for the company s business needs and or projects and does not expose the company to significant additional risks or commitments 
the leases have provided a tax efficient method of financing a portion of these major development projects  and the sale of the pigment receivables offers an attractive low cost source of liquidity 
during  the company entered into a leasing arrangement for its interest in the production platform and related equipment for the gunnison field in the garden banks area of the gulf of mexico 
this leasing arrangement is similar to two arrangements entered into in for the nansen and boomvang fields in the east breaks area of the gulf of mexico 
in each of these three arrangements  the company entered into lease commitments with separate business trusts that were created to construct independent spar production platforms for each field development 
under the terms of the agreements  the company s share of construction costs for the platforms was initially financed by synthetic lease credit facilities between the trust and groups of financial institutions for million  million and million for gunnison  nansen and boomvang  respectively  with the company making lease payments sufficient to pay interest at varying rates on the financings 
upon completion of the construction phase  separate business trusts with third party equity participants acquired the assets and became the lessor owner of the platforms and related equipment 
the company and these trusts have entered into operating leases for the use of the spar platform and related equipment 
during  the nansen and boomvang synthetic leases were converted to operating lease arrangements upon completion of construction of the respective production platforms 
completion of the gunnison platform occurred in december  at which time a portion of the gunnison synthetic lease was converted to an operating lease 
the remaining portion of the gunnison synthetic lease was converted to an operating lease on january  under this type of financing structure  the company leases the platforms under operating lease agreements  and neither the platform assets nor the related debt is recognized in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
however  since only a portion of the gunnison synthetic lease had been converted to an operating lease structure as of year end  the remaining assets and liabilities of the synthetic lessor trust are consolidated in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december   which includes million in property  plant and equipment  million in accrued liabilities  million in long term debt and million in minority interest 
the consolidation of the synthetic lessor trust occurred in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard as discussed in the new revised accounting standards section below 
since the remaining portion of the gunnison synthetic lease was converted to an operating lease structure in january  the related property and debt will not be reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet in in conjunction with the operating lease agreements  the company has guaranteed that the residual values of the nansen  boomvang and gunnison platforms at the end of the operating leases shall be equal to at least of their fair market value at the inception of the lease 
for nansen and boomvang  the guaranteed values are million and million  respectively  in  and for gunnison the guaranteed value is million in estimated future minimum annual rentals under these leases and the residual value guarantees are shown in the table of contractual obligations below 
in december  the company began an accounts receivable monetization program for its pigment business through the sale of selected accounts receivable with a three year  credit insurance backed asset securitization program 
on july   the company restructured the existing accounts receivable monetization program to include the sale of receivables originated by the company s european chemical operations 
the maximum available funding under the amended program is million 
in addition  certain other terms of the program have been modified as part of the restructuring 
under the terms of the program  selected qualifying customer accounts receivable may be sold monthly to a special purpose entity spe  which in turn sells an undivided ownership interest in the receivables to a third party multi seller commercial paper conduit sponsored by an independent financial institution 
the company sells  and retains an interest in  excess receivables to the spe as over collateralization for the program 
the company s retained interest in the spe s receivables is recorded in trade accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet 
the retained interest is subordinate to  and provides credit enhancement for  the conduit s ownership interest in the spe s receivables  and is available to the conduit to pay certain fees or expenses due to the conduit  and to absorb credit losses incurred on any of the spe s receivables in the event of termination 
however  the company believes that the risk of credit loss is very low since its bad debt experience has historically been insignificant 
the company also holds preference stock in the special purpose entity equal to of the receivables sold 
the preference stock is essentially a retained deposit to provide further credit enhancements  if needed  but is otherwise recoverable by the company at the end of the program 
the company records a loss on the receivable sales equal to the difference in the cash received plus the fair value of the retained interests and the carrying value of the receivables sold 
the fair value of the retained interests servicing fees  excess receivables and preference stock of the spe is based on the discounted present value of future cash flows 
at year end and  the outstanding balance on receivables sold under the program totaled million and million  respectively 
during and  the company entered into sale leaseback arrangements with general electric capital corporation gecc covering assets associated with a gas gathering system in the rocky mountain region 
the lease agreements were entered into for the purpose of monetizing the related assets 
the sales price for the equipment was million 
the sales price for the equipment was million  however  an million settlement obligation existed for equipment previously covered by the lease agreement  resulting in net cash proceeds of million in the operating lease agreements have an initial term of five years  with two month renewal options  and the company may elect to purchase the equipment at specified amounts after the end of the fourth year 
the operating lease agreement has an initial term of four years  with two month renewal options 
in the event the company does not purchase the equipment and it is returned to gecc  the company guarantees a residual value ranging from million at the end of the initial terms to million at the end of the last renewal option 
the company recorded no gain or loss associated with the gecc sale leaseback agreements 
estimated future minimum annual rentals under this agreement and the residual value guarantee are shown in the table of contractual obligations below 
in conjunction with the company s sale of its ecuadorean assets  which included the company s nonoperating interest in the oleoducto de crudos pesados ltd 
ocp pipeline  the company has entered into a performance guarantee agreement with the buyer for the benefit of ocp 
under the terms of the agreement  the company guarantees payment of any claims from ocp against the buyer upon default by the buyer and its parent company 
claims would generally be for the buyer s proportionate share of construction costs of ocp  however  other claims may arise in the normal operations of the pipeline 
accordingly  the amount of any such future claims cannot be reasonably estimated 
in connection with this guarantee  the buyer s parent company has issued a letter of credit in favor of the company up to a maximum of million  upon which the company can draw in the event it is required to perform under the guarantee agreement 
the company will be released from this guarantee when the buyer obtains a specified credit rating as stipulated under the guarantee agreement 
in addition  the company enters into certain indemnification agreements related to title claims  environmental matters  litigation and other claims 
the company has recorded no material obligations in connection with its indemnification agreements 
obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into purchase obligations  contracts  leases and borrowing arrangements 
the company has no debt guarantees for unrelated parties 
as part of the company s project oriented exploration and production business  kerr mcgee routinely enters into contracts for certain aspects of a project  such as engineering  drilling  subsea work  etc 
these contracts are generally not unconditional obligations  thus  the company accrues for the value of work done at any point in time  a portion of which is billed to partners 
kerr mcgee s commitments and obligations as of december   are summarized in the following table millions of dollars payments due by period after type of obligation total long term debt   operating leases for nansen  boomvang and gunnison all other operating leases drilling rig commitments purchase obligations ore contracts gas purchase and transportation contracts other purchase obligations leased equipment residual value guarantees total    excludes the million of debt associated with the gunnison trust 
as discussed above  the synthetic lease was restructured to an operating lease in january the related future minimum lease payments are included with operating leases for gunnison 
capital spending capital expenditures are summarized as follows millions of dollars est 
exploration and production  including dry hole costs    chemicals other  including discontinued operations total     capital spending  excluding acquisitions  totaled billion in the three year period ended december   and dividends paid totaled million in the same three year period  which compares with billion of net cash provided by operating activities during the same period 
during the three year period  the company made one major acquisition the acquisition of hs resources for million cash plus common stock and assumed debt 
kerr mcgee has budgeted approximately billion for its capital program in management anticipates that the capital program  dividends and debt reduction can be provided for through internally generated funds 
the available capacity for borrowings may be used for selective acquisitions that support the company s growth strategy or to support the company s capital expenditure program should internally generated cash flow fall short in any one measurement period 
oil and gas the company s exploration and production capital spending continues to be focused on global growth and deepwater projects 
successful exploration and appraisal drilling in the deepwater gulf of mexico has resulted in the development of three major projects during the last two years nansen working interest  boomvang  and gunnison 
the red hawk and constitution projects currently under development are also in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
constitution will be developed with a truss spar  capitalizing on the success of the truss spar technology introduced at the nansen  boomvang and gunnison fields  while red hawk is being developed using innovative cell spar technology 
red hawk is expected to reach initial production in mid  while constitution is expected to reach first production by mid the company expects initial production at its bohai bay development by the end of two bohai bay discoveries are being developed with a centrally located floating production  storage and offloading vessel  along with fixed platforms for dry wellheads 
kerr mcgee operates this development with a working interest 
of the million total budget for  million is allocated to the gulf of mexico  million to the north sea  million to us onshore  million to other international projects  million to technology enhancements and million for dry hole costs 
in addition  the company has budgeted approximately million excluding noncash amortization of nonproducing leasehold costs for other exploration program expenses in the company s exploration program is expected to fund approximately wells  with emphasis on balancing risks and potential rewards in both shallow and deep waters and us onshore 
chemicals capital expenditures for chemical operations are budgeted at million for process and technology improvements that increase productivity and enhance product quality will account for approximately of the capital budget 
this includes the remaining estimated expenditures related to the high productivity oxidation line that began production in january at the savannah  georgia  chloride process pigment plant 
chemical has also budgeted million of additional investment in avestor for market risks the company is exposed to a variety of market risks  including credit risks  the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and certain commodity prices 
the company addresses its risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of insurance and derivative financial instruments 
see notes and for additional discussions of the company s financial instruments  derivatives and hedging activities 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the us dollar is the functional currency for the company s international operations  except for its european chemical operations  for which the euro is the functional currency 
periodically  the company enters into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies 
certain of these contracts purchases of australian dollars and british pound sterling  and sales of euro have been designated and have qualified as cash flow hedges of the company s anticipated future cash flow needs for a portion of its capital expenditures  raw material purchases and operating costs 
these contracts generally have durations of less than three years 
the resulting changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
selected pigment receivables have been sold in an asset securitization program at their equivalent us dollar value at the date the receivables were sold 
the company is collection agent and retains the risk of foreign currency rate changes between the date of sale and collection of the receivables 
under the terms of the asset securitization agreement  the company is required to enter into forward contracts for the value of the euro denominated receivables sold into the program to mitigate its foreign currency risk 
gains or losses on the forward contracts are recognized currently in earnings 
the company has entered into other forward contracts to sell foreign currencies  which will be collected as a result of pigment sales denominated in foreign currencies  primarily in european currencies 
these contracts have not been designated as hedges even though they do protect the company from changes in foreign currency rates 
following are the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates  weighted average contractual exchange rates and estimated contract values for open contracts at year end and to purchase sell foreign currencies

in connection with the issuance of million notes due april   the company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement in the terms of the agreement effectively change the interest the company will pay on the debt until maturity from the fixed rate to a variable rate of libor plus 
the company considers the swap to be a hedge against the change in fair value of the debt as a result of interest rate changes 
the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap was million at december  during february  the company reviewed the composition of its outstanding debt and entered into additional interest rate swaps  converting an aggregate of million in fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
under the interest rate swaps  million of notes due october   will pay a variable rate of libor plus  million of notes due october   will pay a variable rate of libor plus  and million of notes due september   will pay a variable rate of libor plus 
the interest rate swaps have been designated as hedges against changes in the fair value of the related debt resulting from interest rate changes 
the estimated fair value of the interest rate swaps  including the original swap outstanding at december   totaled million as of february  commodity price risk the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices 
to increase the predictability of its cash flows and to support capital projects  the company initiated a hedging program in and periodically enters into financial derivative instruments that generally fix the commodity prices to be received for a portion of its oil and gas production in the future 
at december   the outstanding commodity related derivatives accounted for as hedges had a liability fair value of million  which is recorded as a current liability 
the fair value of these derivative instruments at december   was determined based on prices actively quoted  generally nymex and dated brent prices 
at december   the company had after tax deferred losses of million in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with these contracts 
the company expects to reclassify the entire amount of these losses into earnings during the next months  assuming no further changes in fair market value of the contracts 
during  the company realized a million loss on us oil hedging  a million loss on north sea oil hedging and a million loss on us natural gas hedging 
during  the company realized a million loss on us oil hedging  a million loss on north sea oil hedging and a million loss on us natural gas hedging 
the losses offset the higher oil and natural gas prices realized on the physical sale of crude oil and natural gas 
losses for hedge ineffectiveness are recognized as a reduction of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations and were not material for or at december   the following commodity related derivative contracts were outstanding daily average contract type period volume price natural gas mmbtu mmbtu fixed price swaps nymex q  q  q   costless collars nymex q  basis swaps cig and northwest q  q   q  crude oil bbl bbl fixed price swaps wti q  q  q  q  fixed price swaps brent q  q  q  q  these contracts may be subject to margin calls above certain limits established with individual counterparty institutions

in addition to the company s hedging program  kerr mcgee rocky mountain corp 
holds certain gas basis swaps settling between and through december  the company treated these gas basis swaps as non hedge derivatives  and changes in fair value were recognized in earnings 
on december   the company designated those swaps settling in as hedges since the basis swaps have been coupled with natural gas fixed price swaps  while the remainder settling between and will continue to be treated as non hedge derivatives 
at december   these derivatives are recorded at their fair value of million  of which million is recorded as a current asset and million is recorded in investments other assets 
at december   these derivatives were recorded at their fair value of million in investments other assets 
the net gains associated with these non hedge derivatives were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and are included in other income in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company s marketing subsidiary  kerr mcgee energy services kmes  markets natural gas primarily equity gas in the denver area 
existing contracts for the physical delivery of gas at fixed prices have not been designated as hedges and are marked to market in accordance with fas kmes has also entered into natural gas swaps and basis swaps that offset its fixed price risk on physical contracts 
these derivative contracts lock in the margins associated with the physical sale 
the company believes that risk associated with these derivatives is minimal due to the credit worthiness of the counterparties 
the net asset fair value of these derivative instruments was not material at year end and the fair values of the outstanding derivative instruments at december   were based on prices actively quoted 
during  the net loss associated with these derivative contracts totaled million  of which million is included as a reduction of revenue and million is included in other income 
for and  the net loss associated with these derivative contracts totaled million and million  respectively  and is included as a reduction of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
the losses on the derivative contracts are substantially offset by the fixed prices realized on the physical sale of the natural gas 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and that ultimately affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by the company generally do not impact the company s reported cash flows or liquidity 
generally  accounting rules do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve a selection of the appropriate policies for applying the basic principles 
interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to the company 
the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are assessment of unproved oil and gas properties for impairment  crude oil and natural gas reserve estimation  site dismantlement and asset retirement obligations  recoverability of assets  environmental remediation  derivative instruments  litigation  tax accruals  and benefit plans 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  including engineers  legal counsel  actuaries  environmental studies and historical experience in similar matters 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates as additional information becomes known 
successful efforts method of accounting the company has elected to use the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical costs  rentals  and exploratory dry holes  are charged against income as incurred 
costs of successful wells and related production equipment and developmental dry holes are capitalized and amortized by field using the unit of production method as oil and gas is produced 
the successful efforts method reflects the inherent volatility in exploring for and producing oil and gas 
the accounting method may yield significantly different operating results than the full cost method 
under the successful efforts method  the costs of drilling an exploratory well are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the discovery 
in the case of onshore wells and offshore wells in relatively shallow water  that determination usually can be made upon or shortly after cessation of drilling operations 
however  such determination may take longer depending on  among other things  the amount of hydrocarbons encountered  results of future appraisal drilling and proximity to existing infrastructure especially in the case of deepwater and international exploration 
as a consequence  the company has capitalized costs associated with exploratory wells on its balance sheet at any point in time that may be charged to earnings in a future period if management determines that commercial quantities of hydrocarbons have not been discovered 
at december   the company had capitalized costs of approximately million associated with such ongoing exploration activities  primarily in the deepwater gulf of mexico and china 
oil and gas reserves and standardized measure of future cash flows the estimates of oil and gas reserves and associated future net cash flows are prepared by the company s geologists and engineers 
only proved oil and gas reserves are included in any financial statement disclosure 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
even though the company s geologists and engineers are knowledgeable and follow authoritative guidelines for estimating reserves  they must make a number of subjective assumptions based on professional judgments in developing the reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field 
revisions in the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary due to a number of factors  including reservoir performance  new drilling  oil and gas prices and cost changes  technological advances  new geological or geophysical data  or other economic factors 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning historical changes in reserve estimates and standardized measure of future cash flows for each of the last three years 
the company cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions 
depreciation and depletion rates are calculated using both reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties 
as the estimated reserves are adjusted  the depreciation and depletion expense for a property will change  assuming no change in production volumes or the costs capitalized 
estimated reserves also are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property  which are further used to analyze a property for potential impairment 
in addition  reserves are used to estimate the company s supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to its oil and gas producing activities 
changes in estimated reserves are considered changes in estimates for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis 
site dismantlement and asset retirement obligations the company has significant obligations for the dismantlement and removal of its oil and gas production and related facilities 
estimating future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments since most of the removal activities will occur several years in the future 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations that may ultimately impact the amount of the obligation 
in june  the fasb issued fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which the company adopted on january  the impact of this new standard is discussed below in the new revised accounting standards section 
impairment of assets all long lived assets are assessed for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be greater than its future net cash flows 
the evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events  such as future sales prices for oil  gas or chemicals  future costs to produce these products  estimates of future oil and gas reserves to be recovered  development costs and the timing thereof  the economic and regulatory climates  and other factors 
the need to test a property for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices  unfavorable adjustments to oil and gas reserves  increases in operating costs  and changes in environmental or abandonment regulations 
assets held for sale are reviewed for potential loss on sale when the company approves the plan to sell and thereafter while the asset is held for sale 
losses are measured as the difference between fair value less costs to sell  and the assets carrying value 
estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
the company completed its annual test for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of june   with no impairment loss indicated 
the company cannot predict when or if future impairment charges for held for use assets  goodwill or intangibles  or losses associated with held for sale properties will be recorded 
derivative instruments the company is exposed to risk from fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates 
to reduce the impact of these risks on earnings and to increase the predictability of its cash flow  from time to time the company enters into certain derivative contracts  primarily swaps and collars for a portion of its oil and gas production  forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies  and interest rate swaps 
the company accounts for all its derivative instruments  including hedges  in accordance with fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the commodity  foreign currency and interest rate contracts are measured at fair value and recorded as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
when available  quoted market prices are used in determining fair value  however  if quoted market prices are not available  the company estimates fair value using either quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics or other valuation techniques 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements generally are limited to major institutions 
environmental remediation  litigation and other contingency reserves kerr mcgee management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental  legal or other contingent matters because of continually changing laws and regulations  inherent uncertainties associated with court and regulatory proceedings as well as cleanup requirements and related work  the possible existence of other potentially responsible parties  and the changing political and economic environment 
for these reasons  actual environmental  litigation and other contingency costs can vary significantly from the company s estimates 
for additional information about contingencies  refer to the environmental matters section that follows and note tax accruals the company has operations in several countries around the world and is subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries 
the estimation of the amounts of income tax to be recorded by the company involves interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations  evaluation of tax audit findings  and assessment of how the foreign taxes affect domestic taxes 
although the company s management believes its tax accruals are adequate  differences may occur in the future  depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters 
benefit plans the company provides defined benefit retirement plans and certain nonqualified benefits for employees in the us  us  germany and the netherlands and accounts for these plans in accordance with fas  employers accounting for pensions 
the various assumptions used and the attribution of the costs to periods of employee service are fundamental to the measurement of net periodic cost and pension obligations associated with the retirement plans 
one of the significant assumptions used to account for the company s pension plans is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return forecasting methodology is based on a capital asset pricing model using historical data 
based on this information  the company selected for and for us pension plans 
another significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate 
the company selects a discount rate as of december each year for us plans to reflect average rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments during december of that year 
the average moody s long term aa corporate bond yield for december is used as a guide in the selection of the discount rate for us pension plans 
for december  the average moody s long term aa corporate bond yield was  and the company chose as its discount rate at the end of for december  the average moody s long term aa corporate bond yield was  and the company chose as its discount rate at the end of this decrease in the discount rate effective december   is expected to increase net periodic pension cost by million but not affect expected contributions to fund the pension plans 
the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans 
the company determines this assumption based on its long term plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions 
based on this information  the company selected at december  and  for us pensions plans 
the net effect the us pension plans had on results of operations for was million of income due to the expected return on assets exceeding other pension charges 
the total expected return on assets of the us pension plans for was million  compared with an actual return of million 
during  the company s contributions to the retirement plans totaled million for certain us nonqualified plans and foreign plans 
when calculating expected return on plan assets for us pension plans  the company uses a market related value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses differences between actual return and expected return over five years 
as of january   the amount of unrecognized losses on us pension assets was million 
as these losses are recognized during future years in the market related value of assets  they will result in cumulative increases in net periodic pension cost of million in through a basis point increase decrease in the company s expected long term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of would decrease increase net periodic pension cost for us pension plans for by million 
the change would not affect expected contributions to fund the company s us pension plans 
the company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits and accounts for the related plans in accordance with fas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the postretirement benefit cost and obligation are also dependent on the company s assumptions used in the actuarially determined amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates discussed above  health care cost trend rates  inflation rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
see note for a discussion of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of as it relates to the company s postretirement health care plan 
the above description of the company s critical accounting policies is not intended to be an all inclusive discussion of the uncertainties considered and estimates made by management in applying accounting principles and policies 
results may vary significantly if different policies were used or required and if new or different information becomes known to management 
environmental matters the company s affiliates are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the united states and in foreign countries in which they operate 
under these laws  the company s affiliates are or may be required to obtain or maintain permits and or licenses in connection with their operations 
in addition  under these laws  the company s affiliates are or may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment due to the disposal or release of certain chemical  petroleum  low level radioactive and other substances at various sites 
environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent  and compliance costs are significant and will continue to be significant in the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
sites at which the company s affiliates have environmental responsibilities include sites that have been designated as superfund sites by the us environmental protection agency epa pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla  as amended  and that are included on the national priority list npl 
as of december   the company s affiliates had received notices that they had been named potentially responsible parties prp with respect to existing epa superfund sites on the npl that require remediation 
the company does not consider the number of sites for which its affiliates have been named a prp to be the determining factor when considering the company s overall environmental liability 
decommissioning and remediation obligations  and the attendant costs  vary substantially from site to site and depend on unique site characteristics  available technology and the regulatory requirements applicable to each site 
additionally  the company s affiliates may share liability at some sites with numerous other prps  and the law currently imposes joint and several liability on all prps under cercla 
the company s affiliates are also obligated to perform or have performed remediation or remedial investigations and feasibility studies at sites that have not been designated as superfund sites by epa 
such work is frequently undertaken pursuant to consent orders or other agreements 
current businesses the company s oil and gas affiliates are subject to numerous international  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection 
in the united states  these include the federal water pollution control act  commonly known as the clean water act  the clean air act and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment  the issuance of permits in connection with exploration  drilling and production activities  the release of emissions into the atmosphere  and the discharge and disposition of waste materials 
environmental laws and regulations also govern offshore oil and gas operations  the implementation of spill prevention plans  the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites  and the remediation and monitoring of contaminated sites 
the company s chemical affiliates are subject to a broad array of international  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  including the clean water act  the clean air act  cercla and rcra 
these laws require the company s affiliates to undertake various activities to reduce air emissions  eliminate the generation of hazardous waste  decrease the volume of wastewater discharges and increase the efficiency of energy use 
discontinued businesses the company s affiliates historically have held interests in various businesses in which they are no longer engaged or which they intend to exit 
such businesses include the refining and marketing of oil and gas and associated petroleum products  the mining and processing of uranium and thorium  the production of ammonium perchlorate  and other activities 
additionally  the company expects to complete its exit from the forest products business by the end of although the company s affiliates are no longer engaged in certain businesses or have announced their intention to exit certain businesses  residual obligations may still exist  including obligations related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations  including the clean water act  the clean air act  cercla and rcra 
these laws and regulations require company affiliates to undertake remedial measures at sites of current or former operations or at sites where waste was disposed 
for example  company affiliates are required to conduct decommissioning and environmental remediation at certain refineries  distribution facilities and service stations they owned and or operated before exiting the refining and marketing business in company affiliates also are required to conduct decommissioning and remediation activities at sites where they were involved in the exploration  production  processing and or sale of uranium or thorium 
additionally  the company s chemical affiliate may be required to decommission and remediate its wood treatment facilities as part of its plan to exit the forest products business 
environmental costs expenditures for environmental protection and cleanup for each of the last three years and for the three year period ended december   are as follows millions of dollars total charges to environmental reserves recurring expenses capital expenditures total in addition to past expenditures  reserves have been established for the remediation and restoration of active and inactive sites where it is probable that future costs will be incurred and the liability is reasonably estimable 
for environmental sites  the company considers a variety of matters when setting reserves  including the stage of investigation  whether epa or another relevant agency has ordered action or quantified cost  whether the company has received an order to conduct work  whether the company participates as a prp in the remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs process and  if so  how far the ri fs has progressed  the status of the record of decision by the relevant agency  the status of site characterization  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  the number and financial condition of other potential prps  and whether the company reasonably can evaluate costs based upon a remedial design and or engineering plan 
after the remediation work has begun  additional accruals or adjustments to costs may be made based on any number of developments  including revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contamination  inability to implement a planned engineering design or to use planned technologies and excavation methods  changes in costs of labor  equipment and or technology  any additional or updated engineering and other studies  and weather conditions 
as of december   the company s financial reserves for all active and inactive sites totaled million 
this includes million added in for active and inactive sites 
in the consolidated balance sheet  million of the total reserve is classified as a deferred credit  and the remaining million is included in current liabilities 
management believes that currently the company has reserved adequately for the reasonably estimable costs of known environmental contingencies 
however  additional reserves may be required in the future due to the previously noted uncertainties 
additionally  there may be other sites where the company has potential liability for environmental related matters but for which the company does not have sufficient information to determine that the liability is probable and or reasonably estimable 
the company has not established reserves for such sites 
the following table reflects the company s portion of the known estimated costs of investigation and or remediation that are probable and estimable 
the table summarizes epa superfund npl sites where the company and or its affiliates have been notified it is a prp under cercla and other sites for which the company had some ongoing financial involvement in investigation and or remediation at year end in the table  aggregated information is presented for certain sites that are individually not significant having a remaining reserve balance of less than million or for which the company has not recorded a reserve because the liability is not probable and or reasonably estimable

new revised accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fas requires that an asset retirement obligation aro associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset be recognized as a liability in the period in which it is incurred or becomes determinable as defined by the standard  with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the cost of the tangible asset  including the initially recognized asset retirement cost  is depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
the aro is recorded at fair value  and accretion expense will be recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value 
the fair value of the aro is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at the company s credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
the company adopted fas on january   which resulted in an increase in net property of million  an increase in abandonment liabilities of million and a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities of million 
the net impact of these changes resulted in an after tax charge to earnings of million to recognize the cumulative effect of retroactively applying the new accounting principle 
in accordance with the provisions of fas  kerr mcgee accrues an abandonment liability associated with its oil and gas wells and platforms when those assets are placed in service  rather than its past practice of accruing the expected abandonment costs on a unit of production basis over the productive life of the associated oil and gas field 
no market risk premium has been included in the company s calculation of the aro for oil and gas wells and platforms since no reliable estimate can be made by the company 
in connection with the change in accounting principle  abandonment expense of million in and million in has been reclassified from costs and operating expenses to depreciation and depletion in the consolidated statement of operations to be consistent with the presentation 
in january  the company announced its plan to close the synthetic rutile plant in mobile  alabama  and closed the plant in june since the plant had a determinate closure date  the company accrued an abandonment liability of million associated with its plans to decommission the mobile facility in connection with the adoption of fas in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
for certain guarantees  fin requires recognition at the inception of a guarantee of a liability for the fair value of the obligation assumed in issuing the guarantee 
fin also requires expanded disclosures for outstanding guarantees  even if the likelihood of the guarantor having to make any payments under the guarantee is considered remote 
the recognition provisions of fin were effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  the company has not issued or modified any material guarantees within the scope of fin during  therefore  implementation of this new standard has not impacted its consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation clarifies the application of arb  consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
because application of the majority voting interest requirement in arb may not identify the party with a controlling financial interest in situations where controlling financial interest is achieved through arrangements not involving voting interests  this interpretation introduces the concept of variable interests and requires consolidation by an enterprise having variable interests in a previously unconsolidated entity if the enterprise is considered the primary beneficiary  meaning the enterprise will absorb a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses or residual returns 
for variable interest entities in existence as of february   fin  as originally issued  required consolidation by the primary beneficiary in the third quarter of in october  the fasb deferred the effective date of fin to the fourth quarter 
in accordance with the provisions of fin  the company has consolidated the business trust created to construct and finance the gunnison production platform 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of the trust are reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december   which includes million in property  plant and equipment  million in accrued liabilities  million in long term debt and million in minority interest see notes and 
the company has reviewed the effects of fin relative to its other relationships with possible variable interest entities  such as the lessor trusts that are party to the nansen and boomvang operating leases and certain joint venture arrangements  and has determined that consolidation of these entities is not required 
the company applies the provisions of fas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  for the accounting of oil and gas mineral rights held by lease or contract and accordingly classifies these assets as property  plant and equipment 
this classification is the long standing and current industry standard and is consistent with most mineral rights case law that is  mineral rights generally are treated as interests in real property and real property laws are used to interpret the leases 
however  the sec has asked that the emerging issues task force eitf consider whether mineral rights are intangible assets under the guidance provided by fas no 
 business combinations  and fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
if such interests are deemed to be intangible assets by the eitf  mineral rights to extract oil and gas for both undeveloped and developed leaseholds may be reclassified separately as intangible assets 
even though management believes the company s current balance sheet classification is required under generally accepted accounting principles  reclassification may be necessary in the future when further guidance is provided by the eitf 
however  it is not currently clear which mineral rights might have to be reclassified as intangible assets all producing and nonproducing leaseholds  only nonproducing leaseholds or only leaseholds acquired in business combinations since the effective date of fas no 
any such reclassification would not affect the company s total assets  net worth  cash flows or results of operations 
a reclassification could negatively impact one of the company s debt covenants and certain contractual obligations that require the company to maintain a certain level of tangible net worth  absent waiver or amendment of such provisions 
these mineral rights would continue to be amortized in accordance with fas no 
at december  and  the company had total producing leasehold costs for mineral interests of approximately billion  net of accumulated depletion and amortization  and nonproducing leasehold costs of approximately 
billion  net of accumulated depletion and amortization 
of these amounts  leasehold costs  net of accumulated depletion and amortization  acquired in business combinations since the effective date of fas no 
were approximately billion and billion of producing leasehold costs at december  and  respectively  and 
billion of nonproducing leasehold costs at both december  and item a
