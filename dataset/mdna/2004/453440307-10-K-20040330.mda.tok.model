information pertaining to the company s business segments is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and to general practices within the insurance industry 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis 
insurance reserves the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including legal and other fees as well as a portion of the company s general expenses  for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
the company computes insurance policy benefits primarily using the net premium method based on anticipated investment yield  mortality morbidity on health insurance and withdrawals 
liabilities for insurance policy benefits on certain short term medical coverages were computed using completion factors and expected loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data 
these methods are widely used in the life and health insurance industry to estimate the liabilities for insurance policy benefits 
inherent in these calculations are management and actuarial judgments and estimates within industry standards which could significantly impact the ending reserve liabilities and  consequently  operating results 
actual results may differ  and these estimates are subject to interpretation and change 
management believes that the company s method of estimating the liabilities for insurance policy benefits provides a reasonably accurate level of reserves at december   however  if the company s reserves are insufficient to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses  the company would have to augment its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings  and these charges could be material

liquidity insurance group the insurance group normally provides cash flow from i operations  ii the receipt of scheduled principal payments on its portfolio of fixed income securities  and iii earnings on investments 
such cash flow is used partially to finance liabilities for insurance policy benefits 
these liabilities represent long term and short term obligations which are calculated using certain assumed interest rates 
asset quality the nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders 
of the aggregate carrying value of the insurance group s investment assets  approximately was invested in investment grade fixed income securities  cash and cash equivalents  resale agreements and policy loans and at december  also at such date  approximately of the company s fixed maturities were investment grade 
these investments carry less default risk and  therefore  lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments 
at december  approximately of the carrying value of fixed maturities was invested in diversified non investment grade fixed income securities investments in such securities have different risks than investment grade securities  including greater risk of loss upon default  and thinner trading markets 
the company does not have any mortgage loans or non performing fixed maturities 
investment impairments the company reviews its investments regularly and monitors its investments continually for impairments 
for the years ended december  and  the company recorded a realized loss for other than temporary impairments of million and million  respectively 
in and  million and million  respectively  of the loss relates to an interest related impairment recognized on certain interest only securities io securities resulting from unexpected prepayments of the mortgage obligations underlying the io securities due to falling interest rates 
the company has invested in io securities to help actively manage its interest rate exposure 
typically these securities account for less than of ihc s total portfolio assets and are rated aaa or better 
in a rising interest rate environment  io securities will increase in value which acts to mitigate the unrealized loss on the balance of the bond portfolio 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  io sec urities will decline in value  but there will be an unrealized gain in the rest of the bond portfolio 
although these securities performed as expected  the company applies the methodology of emerging issues task force  recognition of interest income and impairment of purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets eitf in determining when an io security is considered other than temporarily impaired 
the company recorded a realized loss in both and under eitf  since there had been a decrease in expected cash flows combined with a decline in the io securities fair value below cost 
the company s gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities totaled million at december  substantially all of these securities were investment grade 
the unrealized losses  primarily within the corporate securities portfolio  have been evaluated in accordance with the company s policy and were determined to be temporary in nature at december  the company holds all securities as available for sale and accordingly marks all of its securities to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income 
share repurchase program ihc has a program  initiated in  under which it repurchases shares of its common stock 
in  the board of directors authorized an additional  shares to be repurchased under the plan 
as of december    shares were still authorized to be repurchased under the plan 
the following table summarizes information with respect to the share repurchase program maximum number number of average price of shares which month of shares of repurchased can be repurchase repurchased shares repurchased january february march april may june july august september october november december risk management the company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities 
options may be utilized to modify the duration and average life of such assets  see note f iv of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following summarizes the estimated pre tax change in fair value based upon hypothetical parallel shifts in the us treasury yield curve of the fixed income portfolio assuming immediate changes in interest rates at specified levels at december  estimated estimated change change in interest rates fair value in fair value in millions basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline the company monitors its investment portfolio on a continuous basis and believes that the liquidity of the insurance group will not be adversely affected by its current investments 
this monitoring includes the maintenance of an asset liability model that matches current insurance liability cash flows with current investment cash flows 
this is accomplished by first creating an insurance model of the company s in force policies using current assumptions on mortality  lapses and expenses 
then  current investments are assigned to specific insurance blocks in the model using appropriate prepayment schedules and future reinvestment patterns 
the results of the model specify whether the investments and their related cash flows can support the related current insurance cash flows 
additionally  various scenarios are developed changing interest rates and other related assumptions 
these scenarios help evaluate the market risk due to changing interest rates in relation to the business of the insurance group 
in the company s analysis of the asset liability model  a to basis point change in interest rates on the insurance group s liabilities would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company 
with respect to its liabilities  if interest rates were to increase  the risk to the company is that policies would be surrendered and assets would need to be sold 
this is not a material exposure to the company since a large portion of the insurance group s interest sensitive policies are burial policies that are not subject to the typical surrender patterns of other interest sensitive policies  and many of the insurance group s universal life and annuity policies come from liquidated companies which tend to exhibit lower surrender rates than such policies of continuing companies 
additionally  there are charges to help offset the benefits being surrendered 
if interest rates were to decrease substantially  the risk to the company is that some of its investment assets would be subject to early redemption 
this is not a material exposure because the company would have additional gains in its portfolio to help offset the future reduction of investment income 
with respect to its investments  the company employs from time to time as warranted investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures 
balance sheet total investments and cash and cash equivalents increased million at december  largely due to the purchase of policy blocks in the fourth quarter of the million increase in insurance policy benefits and the million increase in funds on deposit is primarily a result of the purchase in the fourth quarter of the company issued million in junior subordinated debt securities to its wholly owned unconsolidated trusts  during the million increase in total stockholders equity is due to net income generated in the year ended december   partially offset by a decrease in unrealized gains on investments and by the net purchase of the company s common stock

all of such receivables are either due from its affiliate  independence american  highly rated companies or are adequately secured 
no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary at december  as of december   the balance due from independence american is million 
corporate corporate derives its funds principally from i dividends and interest income from the insurance group  ii management fees from its subsidiaries  and iii investment income from corporate liquidity

it is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity 
in the event additional funds are required  it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable

if the rating agencies downgrade the company s insurance companies  the company s results of operations and competitive position in the industry may suffer ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
standard life is rated a excellent and madison life is rated a excellent by am best company  inc best 
best s ratings reflect its opinions of an insurance company s financial strength  operating performance  strategic position  and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed to investors 
the ratings of standard life and madison life are subject to periodic review by best 
if best reduces either or both madison life s or standard life s ratings from its current levels  the company s business could be adversely affected 
the company s loss reserves are based on an estimate of its future liability  and if actual claims prove to be greater than the company s reserves  its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected the company maintains loss reserves to cover the its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including legal and other fees as well as a portion of the company s general expenses  for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
because setting reserves is inherently uncertain  the company cannot be sure that current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 
if the company s reserves are insufficient to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses  the company would have to augment its reserves and incur a change to its earnings  and these charges could be material 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
rather  reserves represent an estimate of what the company expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost 
these estimates  which generally involve actuarial projections  are based on the company s assessment of facts and circumstances then known  as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity  frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
these variables are affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  inflation  judicial trends and legislative changes 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable in advance 
additionally  there may be a significant reporting lag between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is reported to the company 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities  particularly those in which the various considerations affecting the type of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made 
reserve estimates are continually refined in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled 
adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates ar e changed 
certain proposed federal and state legislation may  if adopted  adversely affect the company s employer medical stop loss business individuals who obtain health coverage through self insured plans cannot currently sue their employer in state court for punitive or compensatory damages  but can seek legal recourse in federal court where an employer can be ordered to cover a wrongfully denied benefit 
in the continuing debate over health care reform  certain federal and state legislation has been proposed which could have the effect of making plan sponsors  administrators  or certain other parties liable for punitive damages in state court 
while the company cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or what  if any  impact enactment of any of these would have on its employer medical stop loss business  the number of employers offering health benefits or choosing self insured plans could be reduced  plans could increase the portion paid by employees thereby reducing participation  pricing and coverage options could be affected  and the insurance group could be faced with greater liability exposures 
the company s inability to assess underwriting risk accurately could reduce its net income the company s success is dependent on its ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained 
if the company fails to assess accurately the risks it retains  the company may fail to establish the appropriate premium rates and the company reserves may be inadequate to cover its losses  requiring augmentation of the company s reserves  which in turn could reduce the company s net income 
decreases in the fair market value of fixed income securities may greatly reduce the value of the company s investment portfolio  and as a result  the company s financial condition may suffer at december   million of the company s million investment portfolio was invested in fixed income securities 
the fair market value of these fixed income securities and the investment income from these fixed income securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
with respect to the company s investments in fixed income securities  the fair market value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  while net investment income realized by the company from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
in addition  actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
an investment has prepayment risk when there is a ri sk that the timing of cash flows that result from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates 
historically  the impact of market fluctuations has affected the company s financial statements 
because all of the company s fixed income securities are classified as available for sale  changes in the fair market value of the company s securities are reflected in the company s accumulated other comprehensive income 
no adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates 
therefore  interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect the company s stockholders equity  total comprehensive income and or cash flows 
if the company fails to comply with extensive state and federal regulations  the company will be subject to penalties  which may include fines and suspension and which may adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition the company is subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision 
most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors 
this regulation  generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which the company does business  relates to  among other things approval of policy forms and premium rates  standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  which are a measure developed by the national association of insurance commissioners and used by state insurance regulators to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized  licensing of insurers and their agents  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates  restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy  requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders  requiring certain methods of accounting  periodic examinations of the insurance group s operations and finances  prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed  and requiring reserves for unearned premium  losses and other purposes 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies  holding company issues and other matters 
recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation is expected to lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 
the insurance group s business depends on compliance with applicable laws and regulations and its ability to maintain valid licenses and approvals for its operations 
regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant  renew  or revoke licenses and approvals 
regulatory authorities may deny or revoke licenses for various reasons  including the violation or regulations 
in some instances  the insurance group follows practices based on its interpretations of regulations  or those that it believes to be generally followed by the industry  which may be different from the requirements or interpretations of regulatory authorities 
if the insurance group does not have the requisite licenses and approvals and does not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporar ily suspend the insurance group from carrying on some or all of its activities or otherwise penalize it 
that type of action could have a material adverse effect on the insurance group s business 
also  changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal  state or foreign  or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities  could have a material adverse effect on the insurance group s business
