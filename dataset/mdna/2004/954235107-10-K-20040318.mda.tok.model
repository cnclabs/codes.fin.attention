item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is based upon our financial statements as of the dates and for the periods presented in this section 
you should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary data and notes thereto found in item safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements in this form k that relate to future plans  events  expectations  objectives or performance or assumptions underlying such matters are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include  among other things  statements that relate to west marine s future plans  expectations  objectives  performance and similar projections  as well as facts and assumptions underlying these statements or projections 
you should not place undue reliance on such forward looking statements as they speak only as of the date they are made  and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized 
actual results may differ materially from the results expressed or implied in these forward looking statements due to various risks  uncertainties or other factors 
set forth below are certain important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
because consumers often consider boats to be luxury items  the market is subject to changes in consumer confidence and spending habits 
a slowdown in the domestic economy or an increase in interest rates may adversely affect sales volumes  as well as our ability to maintain current gross profit levels 
our operations could be adversely affected if unseasonably cold weather  prolonged winter conditions or extraordinary amounts of rainfall occur during the peak boating season in the second and third quarters 
our direct sales division has faced market share erosion in areas where either we or our competitors have opened stores 
management expects this trend to continue 
as west marine expands into new ventures  concepts and acquisitions  such as boat services and express stores  we face additional challenges including those related to hiring personnel and our unfamiliarity with local demographics 
new markets may also have competitive conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are different from our existing markets 
our acquisition of boat america operations involves a number of risks  including reduced boatus store sales cannibalization in locations served by existing west marine stores as we enhance service levels  gain incremental sales and increase market penetration  unanticipated costs and challenges that could result from integrating the operations and personnel of boatus into our operations and a decline in the economy that could threaten the economic assumptions of the transaction 
our growth has been principally related to our stores operations 
our continued growth depends to a significant degree on our ability to continue to expand our operations through the opening and profitable operation of new stores  as well as our ability to increase net sales at our existing stores 
our planned expansion is subject to a number of factors  including the adequacy of our capital resources  our ability to locate suitable store sites and negotiate acceptable lease terms  to hire  train and integrate employees and to adapt our distribution and other operations systems 
the markets for recreational watersports and boating supplies are highly competitive 
competitive pressures resulting from competitors pricing policies are expected to continue 
the cost of insurance has increased substantially in the past couple of years 
we believe that insurance coverage is prudent for risk management and anticipate that our insurance costs will continue to increase 
for certain types or levels of risk  we might determine that we cannot obtain commercial insurance at acceptable prices 
therefore  we might choose to forego or limit our 
table of contents purchase of relevant insurance  choosing instead to self insure one or more types or levels of risk 
if we suffer a substantial loss that is not covered by commercial insurance  the loss and attendant expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
the price of our common stock may be subject to volatile fluctuations based on general economic and market conditions and by our ability to meet analysts expectations 
failure to meet such expectations  even slightly  could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
variations in the market price of our common stock may be the result of changes in the trading characteristics that prevail in the market for our common stock including low trading volumes  trading volume fluctuations and other similar factors 
we cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future 
additional factors which may affect our financial results include inventory management issues  the impact of the internet and e commerce on the supply chain  fluctuations in consumer spending on recreational boating supplies  environmental regulations  demand for and acceptance of our products and other risk factors disclosed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of west marine s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this form k 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
revenue recognition 
we record sales  net of estimated returns  when merchandise is purchased by customers at retail locations 
when merchandise is shipped from a warehouse directly to a customer  we record sales when such merchandise is received by the customer 
return allowances  which reduce net sales by our best estimate of expected product returns  are estimated using historical experience 
comparable store sales 
we define comparable store sales as sales from stores that have been open at least months and where selling square footage did not change by more than in the previous months 
sales from the boatus stores acquired in january from boat america will be included in comparable store sales statistics beginning in march merchandise inventories 
our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
inventory cost includes certain indirect costs related to the purchasing  transportation and warehousing of merchandise 
we make certain assumptions to adjust inventory value based upon historical experience and current information in order to determine that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
potentially obsolete inventories are marked down based upon current levels of discontinued product and historical analysis of the liquidation of discontinued inventory below cost 
the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal 
vendor allowances 
we receive allowances from vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including cash discounts and purchase quantity discounts 
we recognize such allowances as a reduction to cost of goods sold as the related products are sold 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as store closures  indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
at the time a decision is made to close a store  we record an impairment charge  if appropriate  and accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 

table of contents income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income  state tax apportionment and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
foreign currency translation 
in the preparation of consolidated financial statements  the assets and liabilities of west marine s canadian subsidiary are denominated in canadian dollars and translated to us dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date  income and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the reporting period 
the related translation adjustments are reflected in the other comprehensive income section of the consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
almost all of the revenues and expenditures of west marine are denominated in us dollars 
however  foreign currency gains and losses from transactions denominated in foreign currencies  including inter company transactions  are included in operating results and have not been significant to date 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement components expressed as a percent of net sales net sales cost of goods sold including buying and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to in  west marine had net sales of million  an increase of million  or  over net sales of million in net income was million  or per diluted share  in compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal was a week year  compared to a week year in net sales attributable to our stores division increased million  or  to million in  mostly due to the addition of new stores  which contributed million  and stores purchased from boat america  which contributed million to net sales growth 
other contributing sources include boat shares  tent sales and remodeled stores 
comparable store sales are a key performance metric for our management 
the war in iraq  the soft economy  unseasonably cold and wet weather nationwide and higher fuel prices all contributed to a decrease in our comparable store sales of million  or  in the largest decreases were in sales of discretionary items  such as electronics  and in boating frequency related items  such as maintenance products 
comparable store sales by region for were as follows southeast  northeast  west coast 
management believes that the soft economy had a larger impact on sales in the west coast region 
during the first quarter of  approximately of our stores in the northeast region were closed for up to three days due to inclement weather  adversely affecting sales 
the southeast region contributed approximately percent of our total sales in comparable store sales for are based on a similar week period last year 
port supply sales through our distribution centers increased million  or  to million in  primarily as a result of increased government sales during the year 
direct sales net sales increased million  or  to million  primarily due to gains in international sales aided by favorable foreign exchange rates 
gross profit is another key performance metric for our management 
gross profit increased million  or  in compared to gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in  primarily due to 
table of contents lower product costs  supply chain efficiencies and increased sales volume of higher margin private label products compared to a decline in sales of lower margin products  such as electronics 
management expects the upward trends in additional supply chain efficiencies and increased proportion of private label merchandise in our sales mix to continue 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in  primarily due to expenses related to the operations of the boatus stores acquired  including million expended during the first quarter for incremental integration costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in from in non capital expenditures incurred in preparation for the opening of new retail stores also called pre opening costs are expensed as incurred 
the future profitability of our company is largely dependent on our ability to increase sales and gross profit while containing selling  general and administrative expenses 
income from operations increased million  or  in compared to income from operations  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in  from in  primarily due to increases in selling  general and administrative expenses related to the acquisition of boatus retail operations 
interest expense increased million  or  in compared to  primarily as a result of financing the acquisition of boatus retail operations  for which we also incurred a million charge for extinguishment of then existing debt 
our income tax rate of of pre tax income decreased from in the prior year  primarily due to an income tax benefit of approximately million related to the recognition of state tax credits 
compared to in  west marine had net sales of million  an increase of million  or  over net sales of million in net income was million  or per diluted share  in compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in both and were week years 
net sales attributable to our stores division increased million  or  to million in  mostly due to the addition of new stores  which contributed million to net sales growth 
comparable store net sales increased million  or  in port supply sales through our distribution centers decreased million  or  to million in  primarily as a result of increased sales to port supply customers through retail stores 
direct sales net sales decreased million  or  to million  primarily due to the increase in the number of store locations 
gross profit increased million  or  in compared to gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in  primarily due to lower product costs  supply chain efficiencies  increased sales volume of higher margin private label products and a reduction in inventory shrinkage losses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in  primarily due to increases in direct expenses related to the addition of new stores 
non capital expenditures incurred in preparation for opening new retail stores are expensed as incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in income from operations increased million  or  in compared to income from operations  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in  from in interest expense decreased million  or  in compared to  as a result of lower average borrowings and lower interest rates 
our income tax rate of of pre tax income decreased from in the prior year  primarily due to the impact of no longer amortizing goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources our cash needs are primarily for working capital to support our inventory requirements and capital expenditures  pre opening expenses and beginning inventory for new stores and for remodeling or relocating older stores 
we may also require additional capital in the event we choose to pursue acquisition opportunities 
we believe existing credit facilities and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs through 
table of contents operating activities during  our primary sources of liquidity were cash flow from operations and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by operations during was million  consisting primarily of net income  excluding depreciation and amortization  of million  million in deferred taxes and tax benefits and a million increase in accounts payable  offset by a million increase in inventory and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the inventory increase reflects the increase in the number of stores  including the acquisition of stores from boat america  as well as our commitment to increasing fill rates and advanced stocking of merchandise at stores in preparation for the peak boating season 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  consisting primarily of million of net borrowings under our line of credit and million received from the exercise of stock options and the net sales of common stock pursuant to our associate stock purchase plan  offset by million in repayment of a term loan and million used to payoff of our former line of credit 
capital growth in  we spent million on capital expenditures  including million in cash for the acquisition of the retail stores  catalog and wholesale operations of boat america 
we expect to spend from million to million on capital expenditures during  mainly for new stores 
we intend to fund our expansion through cash generated from operations and bank borrowings 
financing arrangements at the end of fiscal  we had a million credit line expiring in january  and borrowings under this credit line were million  bearing interest at rates ranging from to 
from january  until may   the borrowing limit is raised to million for peak seasonal inventory financing needs 
the credit line is guaranteed by west marine and its subsidiaries and is secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of west marine and its subsidiaries 
the credit line includes a million sub facility for standby and commercial letters of credit  of which up to million is available for the issuance of commercial letters of credit and up to million is available for standby letters of credit 
the credit line also includes a sub limit of up to million for same day advances 
at the end of  borrowings under a previous credit line were million  bearing interest at rates ranging from to 
depending on our election at the time of borrowing  our credit line bears interest at either a the higher of i the bank s prime rate plus or ii the federal funds rate plus or b libor plus 
the credit line contains various covenants which require us to maintain certain financial ratios  including debt service coverage  debt to earnings and current ratios 
the covenants also require us to maintain minimum levels of net worth and place limitations on the levels of certain investments 
these covenants also restrict the repurchase or redemption of our common stock and payment of dividends  investments in subsidiaries and annual capital expenditures 
as of january   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
at the end of  we had million of outstanding stand by letters of credit  compared to million at year end at the end of and  we had million and million  respectively  of outstanding commercial letters of credit 
for both and  the weighted average interest rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was 
contractual obligations aggregated information about our unconditional contractual obligations as of january  is presented in the following table dollars in thousands 
total after years contractual cash obligations long term debt operating leases other long term liabilities total cash contractual obligations assumes that our long term debt is repaid at maturity and not re financed 
operating leases are the only financing arrangements not reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
other long term liabilities consist of our outstanding commercial and standby letters of credit 

table of contents we are a party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and obligate us to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as delivery of functioning software products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
in addition  virtually all of our purchase commitments are cancelable by us without payment  and we have excluded such commitments  along with all associate employment commitments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any unconsolidated special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
seasonality historically  our business has been highly seasonal 
in  of our net sales and all of our net income occurred during the second and third quarters  principally during the period from april through july  which represents the peak months for boat buying  usage and maintenance in most of our markets 
management expects the seasonal fluctuation in net sales to become more pronounced as we continue to expand our operations 
business trends the health of our business is directly related to the number of domestic boat owners and the frequency of boating activities 
according to the national marine manufacturers association  new boat sales increased approximately in the ten years from to however  new boat sales declined in both and from a ten year high in  corresponding with general softening of the us economy during the same period 
this trend may continue in the future 
however  management believes that the improved boat show attendance and heightened consumer confidence experienced during may indicate a coming reversal of this two year decline 
after september   consumers began spending more time with family and stayed closer to home during vacation periods 
we believe this trend may favor a general increase in the frequency of boating activities 
weather  however  affects boating frequency more than any other factor 
for the long term  demographics appear to favor the boating industry through the end of the decade 
according to the us census bureau  the portion of the population aged to  which represents a key component of boat owners and our customer base  is expected to grow significantly before peaking in our growth has been principally fueled by geographic expansion through the opening of new stores and the acquisition of boat america s retail operations in january future net sales and profit growth  if any  will be increasingly dependent on our ability to open new profitable stores 
our direct sales division continues to face market share erosion in markets where either we or our competitors have opened new stores 
we expect this trend to continue 
we operate in a highly competitive industry  and we expect competition to increase in the future 
an increase in competition in our markets may result in pressure on our pricing policies
