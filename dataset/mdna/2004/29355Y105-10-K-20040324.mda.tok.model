item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a medical products company engaged in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of percutaneous vessel introducers  safety needles and related vascular delivery products  the design  development  manufacture and marketing of implantable stimulation leads  lead delivery systems  and lead accessories for cardiac rhythm management  neuromodulation  and hearing restoration markets  and the manufacture of medical devices and components for other medical product companies on a contract basis 
at the beginning of  we were operating in two distinct operating segments the delivery systems division and the gynecology division 
on april   we sold the gynecology division to coopersurgical  inc for approximately million  recognizing a gain of approximately million on the sale 
we continued to manufacture catheters and monitors for coopersurgical until december  when we transferred the manufacturing responsibilities to it 
as a result  we have reported the results of the gynecology division as discontinued operations for the year ended december  and prior years 
we used approximately million of the proceeds to pay off our outstanding debt and focused on increasing the profitability of our existing products  as well as the development and acquisition of new products 
on october   we completed our acquisition of the operating assets of bci from biomec inc and began to operate the bci business through our wholly owned subsidiary  enpath lead technologies  inc elt 
we paid million less assumed liabilities of approximately million plus a working capital adjustment of  in addition  we will make a contingent payment of  on march   based on the final sales results of the acquired bci business 
there is also a second contingent payment due on march   which is based on the increase in proprietary sales in over  that we estimate will be in the range of to million 
we have included elt s results in our consolidated financial statements from october  to december  following the acquisition  enpath medical  inc is comprised of two operating divisions the delivery systems division dsd  formerly medamicus  inc and the lead technologies division ltd  elt  formerly bci 
the divisions are aggregated into one reportable segment the manufacture and sale of medical devices 
the divisions have similar technology  manufacturing  customers and regulatory activities and we expect to jointly conduct sales and marketing and research and development activities  where appropriate  to take advantage of similarities in customers and product development 
our revenues are primarily derived from the design  development  manufacture and marketing of medical devices 
our consolidated revenue was million  consisting of million from dsd and million from ltd for the period from october through december  revenue at dsd was down  compared to primarily due to the million drop in lvlds kit and accessory sales to medtronic  off set in part by increased sales of new products to new customers 
our consolidated gross profit was million  consisting of million from dsd and  from ltd for the period from october through december  gross profit at dsd was down million compared to primarily due to the loss of the high gross profit lvlds kit and accessory sales to medtronic 
our consolidated expenses were million  consisting of million from dsd and million from ltd 
dsd increased spending on research and development and sales and marketing activities in as they continued to develop new products and build an internal sales team 
dsd general and administrative costs were higher  primarily due to increased investor relations activities  as well as increased costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
the million of expenses from ltd included a one time charge of million to write off the purchased in process research and development associated with the purchase of bci 
as a result  we had net income of  or 
per diluted share in  compared to  or

combined summary compared to delivery systems division lead technologies division consolidated change change revenues     gross profit expenses research development     purchased in process r d   sales marketing     general administrative    interest  other     total expenses     income before tax     income tax benefit expense    net income loss     eps diluted from october  to december  consisted only of the delivery systems division delivery systems division we manufacture and market a family of percutaneous venous vessel introducers with proprietary features  as well as our own proprietary valved introducer 
vessel introducers enable physicians to create a conduit through which they can insert infusion catheters  implantable ports and pacemaker leads into a blood vessel 
in addition to this core traditional introducer product line  we have developed and manufacture advanced delivery introducers that have fixed curve or articulating distal tip sections that can be manipulated to enable the health care professional to access parts of the patient s anatomy such as the left ventricle of the heart that cannot be reached by traditional introducers 
these sophisticated advanced delivery introducers are designed and manufactured to meet the unique needs of each procedure being performed 
we also manufacture safety products  primarily a safety needle that can be retracted into a protective sheath while still in the patient  greatly reducing the possibility of a needle stick and infection to the health care professional after the needle has been in contact with a patient s blood 
finally  we perform contract manufacturing and engineering services under which we design and manufacture products at our facilities to third party customer specifications 
lead technologies division we develop  and manufacture proprietary and custom designed implantable stimulation leads  adapters and delivery systems for cardiac resynchronization therapy crt and neuromodulation 
we also provide laser processing and contract manufacturing services for our medical device customers for implantable and disposable devices 
results of operations delivery systems division compared to total revenues from operations were  for compared to  for  representing a decrease 
sales of our core introducer products increased to  in  compared to  in this increase was primarily due to continued growth in sales to both new and existing customers 
we had hoped to see a larger increase in our introducer product sales during with the launch of our flowguard valved introducer in the second quarter 
unfortunately  due to a design issue related to the handle resin  we voluntarily pulled the product off the market in june and spent the remainder of resolving the issue 
the issue has been resolved and we anticipate re launching the product in the first half of we expect sales of our core introducer products to grow rapidly in as we begin to ship our flowguard product to the marketplace and add additional customers and products 
sales of our advanced delivery products decreased to  in  compared to  in these sales were primarily comprised of left ventricle lead delivery system lvlds procedural kits and components sold to medtronic in support of its launch of the insync pacing device to treat congestive heart failure 
as we previously reported  medtronic has transitioned packaging of these procedural kits to its own facility 
we provided medtronic with several components for these kits during  but we have seen a significant decline in orders for these components throughout the year 
we anticipate that our advanced delivery product sales will be flat or slightly lower in as we continue to experience a decline in medtronic component sales  off set by new advanced delivery product roll outs 
we are currently working on twelve development projects related to advanced delivery products with a variety of companies 
we are conducting the product development work and incorporating some portions of our own intellectual property in each of these projects 
each relationship is typically accompanied by a supply agreement that would provide us an additional revenue stream if the final product is commercialized 
sales of safety needles were  in  compared to  in  representing an increase of  most of these increased sales are the result of the incorporation of the safety needle into medtronic kits for us distribution starting in the second quarter of on april   we announced a supply agreement with cook incorporated under which we appointed cook the exclusive distributor of our single pack axia rsn safety needles in the united states 
we shipped a small initial order of safety needles to cook during the third and fourth quarters and we expect to ramp up sales to cook during we also shipped small quantities of needles to a number of potential customers to begin their evaluation of the product 
we expect safety product sales to accelerate in as we begin to ramp up shipments of safety needles to cook under the new supply agreement 
other sales  consisting of contract manufacturing  engineering services and freight charges were  in  compared to  in this increase was primarily due to increased engineering service sales  off set by decreases in contract manufacturing sales during the comparable periods 
gross profit decreased to  in  compared to  in gross profit as a percent of sales decreased from to for the comparable periods 
our gross profits in decreased as a percent of sales when compared to for several reasons 
a major reason for the decrease is due to the drastic reduction in our high gross profit medtronic advanced delivery product sales 
we also made a conscious decision to retain all of our production staff while we resolved the flowguard resin issue and we used the time to conduct training and rearrange our production floor for greater efficiency 
as a result  we had higher manufacturing overhead costs than would be typical for the lower level of production we generated 
we also have relatively high fixed costs related to the amortization of our investment in obtaining the rights to the arterial safety needle market  as well as depreciation on the automated safety needle assembly equipment beginning in april  as compared to sales of safety needles 
we also incurred additional costs in the first quarter of when we manually assembled safety needles  as well as additional costs in the second quarter of when we wrote off inventory associated with the flowguard valved introducer 
finally about of our sales were for engineering services that carry a margin rate substantially lower than our typical proprietary product sales 
we expect some improvement in our margins in but would not expect to get back to our historical margins until the flowguard is fully launched and safety needle sales increase to higher levels than currently attained 
research and development expenses were  or of sales in  compared to  or of sales in these increases were primarily due to increasing our engineering staff and continuing expenditures on a variety of new product development activities 
we plan to spend approximately of our sales dollars in on research and development activities in order to continue to generate new products for our customers 
selling expenses were  or of sales in  compared to  or of sales in this increase was primarily due to increased spending on salaries  trade shows and travel  partially off set by a decrease in commission expense 
we have been developing an internal sales and marketing department over the past two years and have added a number of positions since january of to help drive the sales and marketing efforts for our new products 
with the addition of these positions  we have attended more trade shows to build awareness of our products and incurred higher travel costs than in past years 
additionally  with these new positions  we have been able to reduce commission expenses related to our two independent sales representatives 
we expect sales and marketing costs to approximate of sales in as we continue to build our sales efforts 
general and administrative expenses were  or of sales in  compared to  or of sales in the increases in dollars were primarily due to increased spending on salaries  accounting fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  legal fees contract work  investor relations  depreciation  consulting services and insurance 
in  general and administrative expenses of the delivery systems division will be combined with the expenses of the lead technologies division as much of the general and administrative activities will span both divisions 
we expect overall general and administrative expenses to be approximately of consolidated sales in interest income decreased  and interest expense increased  in compared with interest income decreased primarily due to lower cash balances resulting from the use of excess cash to fund the acquisition of bci  as well as lower interest rates compared to interest expense increased primarily due to the interest on the million note payable that was put in place in october to help fund the bci acquisition 
lead technologies division october  to december  revenues from operations since october   the date bci was acquired  were  total revenues  which include the revenue of bci prior to its acquisition  increased to  compared to  for sales of our proprietary products  consisting of implantable stimulation leads  lead delivery systems and adaptors were  since october  sales of proprietary products for all of increased to  compared to  for the key drivers in our high sales growth in were a three fold growth in our proprietary myopore epicardial lead sales and increased demand for our is adapters 
high growth in the myopore lead sales was driven by the rapid growth of the cardiac resynchronization therapy crt market and the demand for sutureless epicardial leads for left ventricular pacing in failed transvenous left ventricular placements 
we believe the volume of myopore leads will continue to increase due to the continued growth of the crt procedure  but at a more moderate rate than that experienced in sales of our contract manufacturing products  consisting primarily of lead accessories were  since october  total sales of our contract manufacturing products increased to  compared to  for the growth in pacing accessories was primarily due to one customer s increase in stocking levels and higher demand due to that customer s sales force expansion 
we anticipate that pacing accessory sales will remain flat in other contract manufacturing revenue growth was due to increased demand for oem procedure kits  laser processing of prosthetic discs  and the successful start up of a hemostatic powder filling operation 
while the contract manufacturing sales revenue is likely to be less than  the contract manufacturing gross profit percentage will be higher than in addition  the percentage of total sales revenue coming from contract manufacturing in is likely to decrease from over in to less than in in favor of higher margin proprietary product sales other sales consisting of our contract development work and freight were  since october  other sales were  for all of  compared to  for contract development work in was primarily related to development of stimulation leads for a variety of emerging neurostimulation applications 
these co development efforts have been initiated to fuel longer term manufacturing growth tied to development and supply arrangements with emerging therapy start up companies 
gross profit totaled  or of sales since october gross profit for all of was  or of sales compared to  or of sales in gross profit grew in primarily because of increased sales of our higher margin proprietary products 
other changes that helped improve our gross profit in included the implementation of cost reduction efforts in strategic supply  manufacturing processing improvements and increased efficiencies in the production work force due to hiring  training  and retention programs 
we were also able to pass on price increases to customers of our proprietary products that had not seen price increases in several years 
we expect that our gross profit percentage will continue to improve in as proprietary product sales continue to increase as part of our overall sales revenue mix 
research and development expenses were  since october  for all of  research and development expenses totaled  compared to  in in addition  in december we wrote off  of purchased in process research and development costs as part of the acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
significant investment in internal research and development in was noteworthy because no internal research and development projects had been conducted since beginning in january  we initiated development projects for a steroid epicardial lead  a deflectable epicardial lead  and a family of is adapters 
revenue generation from these new products will commence in the second half of  although the major impact of new product sales will not be realized until research and development spending in is estimated to be approximately of sales  with higher spending in the first half of the year due to the funding of animal studies and a number of us and european regulatory submissions related to gaining approval to market the steroid epicardial lead which is a class iii device 
sales and marketing expenses were  since october  for all of  sales and marketing expenses were  or approximately of sales due to marketing activities related to the repositioning of bci  as well as our exhibitions at three physician conferences 
with much of the initial foundation created in  sales and marketing expenses in will level out and represent approximately of sales 
general and administrative expenses were  since october  for all of  general and administrative expenses were  in  general and administrative expenses of the lead technologies division will be combined with the activities of the delivery systems division as much of the general and administrative activities will span both divisions 
interest and other expenses were since october  as part of the acquisition   of the purchase price was classified as identifiable intangible assets 
we wrote off  of this amount in december as purchased in process research and development costs  leaving the remaining  to be written off as amortization expense over the next five to thirty years see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we recognized approximately  of amortization expense in and will recognize approximately  of amortization expense in that will be reflected in the following categories cost of goods sold  general and administrative expenses  sales and marketing expenses  and research and development expenses  delivery systems division compared to total revenues from continuing operations increased to  for compared to  for sales of our core introducer products increased to  in  compared to  in the increase was primarily due to increased sales to bard access systems under the april supply agreement that was beginning to ramp up in  as well as increased sales to a number of other customers that were added during late we also benefited from a one time shipment of specialty introducers to medtronic in the third quarter of sales of our advanced delivery products increased to  in  compared to  in these sales were primarily comprised of lvlds procedural kits and components sold to medtronic in support of its launch of the insync pacing device to treat congestive heart failure 
in early  medtronic advised us of its intent to begin to assemble the lvlds kits in its own facility beginning in the second quarter of while we continued to provide lvlds kits and components to medtronic subsequent to its anticipated transition date  sales for the last two quarters of were each approximately  less than the comparable periods from a year earlier 
in the fourth quarter of  we began marketing our guidewire introducer safety needle that incorporates technology licensed from med design corporation 
sales of safety needles were  in  compared to  in on june   we announced our first safety needle supply agreement with bard endoscopic technologies and on october  we announced a new supply agreement with medtronic 
contract manufacturing sales were  in  compared to  in  representing a increase 
the increase was due to one customer ordering more products in compared to contract manufacturing sales represent sales of products to companies that have brought us a finished product design and asked us to manufacture it for them 
other sales  which include freight charges to customers and engineering services  totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
engineering services represent contract development work that we do on behalf of our customers 
gross profit increased to  in  compared to  in gross profit as a percent of sales decreased from to for the comparable periods 
gross profit as a percent of sales was lower for two reasons 
first  we made significant improvements to our infrastructure over the last year to accommodate the anticipated growth of our business 
these improvements included expansion of our clean room  the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment  the hiring of additional management personnel and the purchase of a new integrated software system 
these infrastructure improvements have added additional overhead costs that are not currently being fully absorbed 
second  we made an investment of  to gain exclusive rights to the arterial safety needle market with med design corporation that is being amortized over months 
research and development expenses were  or of sales in  compared to  or of sales in these increases were primarily due to increasing our engineering staff and continuing expenditures on a variety of new product development activities 
selling expenses were  or of sales in  compared to  or of sales in these increases were primarily due to increased spending on salaries  commissions  trade shows and new marketing materials 
we hired a new director of sales and marketing in january to help drive the sales and marketing efforts for the safety needle product 
we also hired a product marketing manager and a sales administrator during the third quarter of to assist with ramping up our safety needle sales  as well as other new product sales 
general and administrative expenses were  or of sales in  compared to  or of sales in the increases in dollars were primarily due to increased spending on accounting fees primarily tax return preparation  legal fees contract work  investor relations  depreciation  consulting services and insurance 
interest income decreased  and interest expense decreased  during the comparable periods 
interest income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates while interest expense decreased because we utilized some of the cash from the sale of the gynecology division to fully pay down our line of credit in april as a result  we had net income after taxes of  or 
per diluted share for  compared to net income of  or per diluted share for the net income for included the gain on the sale of the gynecology division of  recognition of an income tax benefit of  on unutilized net operating tax loss carryforwards  and after tax income from operations of discontinued segment of  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of  compared to  as of december  net cash provided by operating activities during was  consisting of net income of  adjusted for non cash items consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization of  and write off of purchased in process research and development of  other material changes that affected operating activities were an increase in deferred tax assets of  a net change in operating assets and liabilities of  and income taxes payable of  net cash used in investing activities during was  consisting primarily of the purchase of equipment totaling  additions to patent rights and trademarks totaling  and net cash paid for the bci acquisition of  net cash provided by financing activities during was  we made principal payments on capital leases of  and payments on note payable to bank of  this was offset by proceeds from option and warrant exercises of  and proceeds on long term debt of  on october   we entered into a financing arrangement with a bank that included a five year term loan of  which was used to finance a portion of the bci acquisition  and a  line of credit  all of which was available at december  we closed the previous line of credit in conjunction with this refinancing 
the borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets and also contain certain financial covenants that must be met on a quarterly basis 
the agreement also prohibits the payment of dividends without the consent of the lender 
at december   we were in violation of certain of these covenants  due to the million write off of purchased in process research and development related to the bci acquisition 
on march   the bank waived the covenant violation and amended the agreement which provides  among other things  an extension of the expiration date on the line of credit to april  payments on the term loan consist of monthly principal payments of  plus interest at libor plus 
these payments commenced in november the line of credit bears interest at libor plus with no minimum interest due and expires on april  the availability under the line is subject to borrowing base requirements  and advances are at the discretion of the lender 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit at december  as of december   our working capital current assets minus current liabilities was  or a current ratio of to  compared to working capital of  or a current ratio of to as of december  accounts receivable increased  inventory increased  current maturities of notes payable increased  accounts payable increased  and accrued liabilities increased  primarily due to the acquisition of bci 
accrued liabilities included  due to biomec inc related to the working capital adjustment of  that was paid in february  and the  cash portion of the first contingent payment that is due on march  income taxes payable decreased  due to the payment of our taxes in a summary of our contractual cash obligations at december  is as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total long term debt  including interest    operating leases     total contractual cash obligations    we also have a commercial commitment as described below other commercial commitment total amount committed outstanding at date of expiration line of credit  april  we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents as of december  in connection with our acquisition of bci  we made a working capital adjustment payment of  in february and are required to make the contingent payment of  on march  which will be paid in cash and in stock 
additionally  we may be required to make an additional payment related to the contingent payment that would be due on march  our current estimate is that this payment will fall in the million range 
in february  we entered into a letter agreement with biomec inc  under which we agreed to pay the contingent payment as stock and cash 
the value of the stock to be issued in conjunction with the contingent payment will be valued at no less than or more than per share 
while we believe that we have sufficient resources with our current cash and the credit facility to make payments required under the acquisition and to fund our planned operations for fiscal  there is no assurance that we will not need additional capital in the future 
sources of additional capital may include additional debt financing or the sale of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain additional capital on favorable terms 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  known trends in our industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical policies that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish estimates of the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
our management analyzes accounts receivable  historical write offs as bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount that we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
we have not experienced significant bad debts expense and our reserve for doubtful accounts of  should be adequate for any exposure to loss in our december  accounts receivable 
allowance for excess and slow moving inventory inventories  which are composed of purchased parts and subassemblies  work in process and finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined by the first in  first out method 
on a periodic basis  we analyze the level of inventory on hand  its cost in relation to market value and estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess or slow moving inventory are required 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates 
if actual or expected requirements were significantly greater or lower than the established reserves  a reduction or increase to the obsolescence allowance would be recorded in the period in which such a determination was made 
we have established reserves for excess and slow moving inventories and believe the reserve of  at december  is adequate 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets including intangible assets with finite lives as a matter of policy  we review our major assets for impairment at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment of finite life assets requires us to make estimates of the fair value of our long lived assets  primarily based on projected future cash flows using discount rates determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model or another valuation technique 
for indefinite life intangibles  we determine whether the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds its expected future cash flows 
if we determine that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable  we will be required to reduce the valuation of these assets on our financial statements 
significant assets include the following goodwill the estimate of the fair value of the goodwill that resulted from our recent acquisition of bci is one of the more significant estimates based on the judgment required in projecting future cash flows as well as considering both the current amount recorded  approximately million  and its possible increase of to million  if a second contingent purchase payment is required see note to the consolidated financial statements 
safety needle the realization of our investments in the license agreement and manufacturing equipment related to the safety needle aggregate investment of approximately million at december  is dependent upon attaining a sustained level of sales of this product 
we currently are comfortable projecting a level of future sales that is more than sufficient to allow us to fully realize the investments we have made in the safety needle product 
however  if actual sales fail to reach these levels  our investments made in this product may not be fully realizable in the future 
please refer to the risk factors caption below for a discussion of factors that will have an effect on our ability to attain a sustained level of safety needle sales 
other intangibles with finite lives other intangibles with finite lives consist primarily of purchased technology  trade name  patents  customer relationships and trademarks aggregate net balance of million at december  are being amortized on a straight line method over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
allocation of purchase price paid for the bci acquisition as a result of our acquisition of bci  as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  we were required to allocate the consideration paid for bci between tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development ipr d  and goodwill 
the value assigned to ipr d was determined by identifying those acquired specific in process research and development projects that would be continued and for which a technological feasibility had not been established at the acquisition date  b there was no alternative future use  and c the fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability 
we were required to make significant estimates to determine the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets 
we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist in the determination of the fair values of the intangible assets 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets was determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rates used in calculating the present value of the various intangibles was in accordance with accepted valuation methods and for ipr d also included the consideration of the risks of not achieving commercial feasibility 
the goodwill that resulted from this acquisition represents the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of the total tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation establishes standards for identifying a variable interest entity and for determining under what circumstances a variable interest entity should be consolidated with its primary beneficiary 
until now  a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
interpretation no 
changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the application of interpretation no 
did not have any effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
statement no 
requires that certain freestanding financial instruments be reported as liabilities in the balance sheet 
depending on the type of financial instrument  it will be accounted for at either fair value or the present value of future cash flows determined at each balance sheet date with the change in that value reported as interest expense in the income statement 
prior to the application of statement no 
 either those financial instruments were not required to be recognized  or if recognized were reported in the balance sheet as equity and changes in the value of those instruments were normally not recognized in net income

forward looking statements statements included in this annual report on form k  in the letter to shareholders  in our quarterly reports  in filings by us with the securities and exchange commission  in our press releases  and oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer that are not historical or current facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of certain important factors could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of these statements 
investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially are those discussed in the section of this annual report on form k entitled risk factors 
additional factors that could cause results to differ materially are the following our ability to successfully integrate the bci ltd operation  our dependence upon a limited number of key customers for our revenue  our ability to complete development of our steroid epicardial lead and delivery tool  our ability to find distribution partners for our steroid lead and delivery tool  our dependence upon licensing agreements with third parties for the technology underlying some of our products  especially the safety needle  our ability to negotiate and enter into safety needle supply agreements with major medical device companies and our ability and that of our customers to achieve market acceptance of the safety needle  our ability to effectively manufacture our safety needle using our automated safety needle assembly equipment in anticipated required quantities  our ability to develop or acquire new products to increase revenues  our ability to attract and retain key personnel  introduction of competitive products  patent and government regulatory matters  economic conditions  and our ability to raise capital 
all our forward looking statements  whether written or oral are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements 
in addition  we disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof 
risk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
we have two major customers and depend on these customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
medtronic accounted for approximately and and a second customer accounted for approximately and of our total sales from operations in and  respectively 
we anticipate that our expected near term future growth in sales will be tied in part to these customers sales of their existing products  as well as new products incorporating our products as components 
because we anticipate that sales of our components and kits to medtronic for use in medtronic s left ventricle lead delivery systems lvlds will continue to decrease  we are attempting to expand our customer base and our product offerings 
we cannot ensure that we will be successful in making sales to new customers  increasing sales to existing customers other than medtronic or developing and marketing new products 
to the extent that we do not expand our customer base and product offerings  sales to medtronic and the second customer will continue to account for a major portion of our revenues  making us vulnerable to the risks described below 
we anticipate the acquisition of bci will reduce our concentration of business with medtronic to approximately in and with the second customer to less than 
on october   we entered into a supply agreement with medtronic that requires medtronic to purchase exclusively from us all of its requirements for certain delivery systems and introducer kits manufactured by us for a period of five years 
the supply agreement also sets forth the terms under which medtronic will begin including our axia rsn retractable guidewire introducer safety needle as part of medtronic s introducer kits 
there are no minimum purchase obligations under the supply agreement for our current products or any future products we may develop 
if sales of medtronic s products that incorporate our products as components decrease or if medtronic does not develop new products incorporating our products as components  future sales of our products to medtronic and our results of operations would be adversely affected 
further  any action by medtronic to discontinue any of its products that incorporate our products  to redesign or change the technical requirements for its products so that our products would not meet those requirements  or to otherwise limit or discontinue its purchases from us would have a material adverse impact on sales of our products and  consequently  our financial results 
in addition  although under the terms of the supply agreement  medtronic agreed to begin including the axia rsn retractable guidewire introducer safety needles as part of its introducer kits  if medtronic s customers determine not to use the safety needle  or request that they not be included in the introducer kits  then our anticipated future revenue for the sale of this product may not develop 
in addition  under the supply agreement  if we fail to supply certain products  medtronic may manufacture and sell these products or have these products manufactured by another party 
our failure to supply these products would result in a loss of sales to medtronic and would have a material adverse impact on our revenues 
moreover  the supply agreement establishes the pricing medtronic receives with respect to each product and provides that if we extend more favorable pricing to any other customer  that same pricing will also be extended to medtronic 
further  a reduction in our pricing with medtronic would likely result in a decline in our overall revenue 
we depend upon the safety needle licensing agreement and successful introduction of the safety needle 
an important element of our growth strategy is focused on successfully manufacturing and marketing the safety needle licensed from med design corporation 
we currently have the exclusive right to make  use and sell med design corporation s center line retractable safety needle in the venous market  in the arterial access market and other related fields 
under the terms of the license agreement  we must sell designated quantities of product each year to retain exclusive rights to the technology and must pay as much as of our revenues from sales of safety needles to med design as royalties 
if we do not sell the designated quantity of product each year  we can retain our exclusive rights by paying med design the amount of money necessary to cover the royalty shortfall 
through  we have not met our minimum product quantities and have paid med design the difference necessary to retain our exclusive rights to the technology 
there is no assurance that we can manufacture the safety needle at a cost  or sell the safety needle at a price  that will result in an acceptable rate of return for us 
in order to sell enough safety needles to retain our license  we must develop customers in the arterial market  a market in which we currently have no customers and no marketing experience 
there is no assurance that we can successfully penetrate the arterial market 
we acquired a million automated assembly system to manufacture safety needles that became fully operable in the second quarter of if we fail to penetrate and achieve significant sales of safety needles  or if we lose our ability to market and sell the safety needle  our future prospects would be adversely affected 
we may need additional capital in the future 
we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents as of december  in connection with our acquisition of bci  we made a working capital adjustment payment of  in february and are required to make the contingent payment of  on march  which will be paid in cash and in stock 
additionally  we may be required to make an additional payment related to the contingent payment that would be due on march  our current estimate is that this payment will fall in the million range 
in february  we entered into a letter agreement with biomec inc  under which we agreed to pay the contingent payment as stock and cash 
the value of the stock to be issued in conjunction with the contingent payment will be valued at no less than or more than per share 
on october   we entered into a financing arrangement with a bank that included a five year term loan of  which was used to finance a portion of the bci acquisition  and a  line of credit  all of which was available at december  we closed the previous line of credit in conjunction with this refinancing 
the borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets and also contain certain financial covenants that must be met on a quarterly basis 
the agreement also prohibits the payment of dividends without the consent of the lender 
at december   we were in violation of certain of these covenants  due to the million write off of purchased in process research and development related to the bci acquisition 
on march   the bank waived the covenant violation and amended the agreement which provides  among other things  an extension of the expiration date on the line of credit to april  payments on the term loan consist of monthly principal payments of  plus interest at libor plus 
these payments commenced in november the line of credit bears interest at libor plus with no minimum interest due and expires on april  the availability under the line is subject to borrowing base requirements  and advances are at the discretion of the lender 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the agreement at december  while we believe that we have sufficient resources with our current cash and the new credit facility to make payments required under the acquisition and to fund our planned operations for fiscal  there is no assurance that we will not need additional capital in the future 
sources of additional capital may include additional debt financing or the sale of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain additional capital on favorable terms 
we have only attained profitability recently 
we became a publicly traded company in and incurred losses in each of the years from to for the years ended december    and  we reported net income of  million  million and  net income for included million related to the sale of the gynecology division  as well as recognition of income tax benefit of  resulting from the elimination of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
in  bci was profitable for the first time in many years 
however  our results only included income from bci from october  to december  and included a one time write off of million related to the purchase of in process research and development costs associated with the acquisition 
there is no assurance that we will be able to effectively integrate the operation of bci and maintain profitable operations in the future 
the government heavily regulates our business 
the medical products that we sell and propose to sell are subject to regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in certain states and foreign countries 
the process of complying with requirements of the fda and other agencies can be costly and time consuming 
we have received clearance from the fda to market our vessel introducer products  safety needle  epicardial lead and implant tool 
there is no assurance that any future additional clearance can be obtained 
in addition  once obtained  these clearances are subject to review  and later discovery of previous unknown problems may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market 
we are also subject to certain fda regulations governing manufacturing practices  packaging and labeling 
non compliance with these regulations can result in product recalls or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
we depend on patents and proprietary technology 
our success may depend on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes  to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
we have patents issued related to various aspects of vessel introducers and stimulation leads 
there can be no assurance that any future patent protection will be granted  that the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged 
the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and therefore may be highly uncertain 
we also rely upon unpatented trade secrets  and no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent trade secrets or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology 
we depend on our key personnel 
failure to attract and retain skilled personnel could hinder our research and development and manufacturing efforts 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of key technical and senior management personnel 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified managerial and technical personnel 
the inability to retain or attract qualified personnel could have a significant negative effect upon our efforts and thereby materially harm our business and financial condition 
we face intense competition and rapid technological change 
we are faced with intense competition and rapid technological and industry change and  if our competitors existing products or new products are more effective or superior to our products  the commercial opportunity for our products will be reduced or eliminated 
we face intense competition from other device manufacturers  many of whom are significantly larger and have greater financial  technical  research  marketing  sales  distribution and other resources than we do 
we believe there will be intense price competition for products developed in our markets 
our competitors may develop or market technologies and products that are more effective or commercially attractive than any we are developing or marketing 
our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and introducing or commercializing products before we do 
such developments could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition 
even if we are able to compete successfully  we may not be able to do so in a profitable manner 
the medical device industry is generally characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  and frequent new product introductions 
our products may be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations 
we risk product liability claims and product recalls 
the manufacture and sale of medical products entails significant risk of product liability claims or product recalls 
our existing insurance coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur in connection with the clinical trials or sales of our products 
we may require increased product liability coverage as our products are commercialized 
insurance is expensive and may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage  or a recall of our products  could have a significant negative effect on our business and financial condition 
even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and management time and could have a negative impact on our business 
we have limited sources of supply for our products 
we currently purchase  and will in the future purchase  components and raw materials from outside vendors 
although we have identified alternative suppliers for key components and raw materials  at the present time we generally use one source of supply for each component and raw material 
should a key supplier be unwilling or unable to supply any such component or raw material in a timely manner  or should approval of a proposed supplier be delayed  withheld or withdrawn  we could experience delays in obtaining alternative suppliers  which may adversely affect our business 
we have a limited public market for our common stock 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
the average daily trading volume approximated  shares per day in   shares per day in   shares per day in  and  through march  there can be no assurance that an active market will exist for our common stock  or that our common stock could be sold without a significant negative impact on the publicly quoted price per share 
in april  biomec inc will distribute to its shareholders the  shares of our common stock that it received in connection with our acquisition of bci 
any significant re sales into the market by these shareholders could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our future operating results may fluctuate 
if our revenue declines in a quarter compared to the revenue in the previous quarter  our earnings will likely decline as well  due to the fact that many of our expenses are relatively fixed 
in particular  research and development  marketing and general and administrative expenses are not affected directly by variations in revenue 
in some future quarter or quarters  due to a decrease or shortfall in revenue or for some other reason  our operating results likely will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock may fall abruptly and significantly 
our research and development projects may not reach technological feasibility 
our lead technologies division currently has three major product development projects in process steroid leads  adapters and an implant tool 
we are planning on spending approximately million in to continue the development of these products 
while we believe that these three in process projects will reach technological feasibility  because of the risks associated with the commercial viability of these products  there can be no assurance that these projects will actually achieve commercialization 
such risks include the delay or failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or the failure to achieve market acceptance 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities used to maintain liquidity 
our earnings have not been materially affected by changes in interest rates on our floating interest rate debt because we have not maintained an outstanding balance on our line of credit agreement 
based on our current borrowings  an increase of basis points in prevailing interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by less than  we have invested our excess funds in a money market fund and do not believe that a change in interest rates on such money market fund would have a material effect on our earnings
