item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview rpc provides a broad range of specialized oilfield services primarily to independent and major oilfield companies engaged in exploration  production and development of oil and gas properties throughout the united states  including the gulf of mexico  mid continent  southwest and rocky mountain regions  and selected international locations 
rpc s business is affected by geopolitical factors such as political instability in the petroleum producing regions of the world  overall economic conditions and weather in the united states  the prices of oil and natural gas  and our customers drilling and production activities 
the company s revenues are earned by providing equipment and services to customers who operate oil and gas properties and invest capital to drill new wells and enhance production or perform maintenance on existing wells 
rpc s management is presently focused on opportunities to increase its revenues and earnings through expansion in the middle east and selected domestic markets  as well as assessing current operations and focusing on means to reduce costs 
the company s management also continues to monitor factors that impact the level of current and expected customer activities  such as the price of oil and natural gas  among other factors 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
see also forward looking statements on page outlook drilling activity in the us domestic oilfield  as measured by the rotary rig count  is stronger than it has been during the past months  but the outlook continues to be uncertain 
the overall domestic rig count during the first two months of is approximately percent higher than in the comparable period in  and all of the increase is attributed to an increase in the rig count related to drilling for natural gas 
this is a favorable trend for the company s revenues and earnings because our services tend to be better suited for deep  high pressure wells  which tend to be the types of wells that produce natural gas 
however  drilling activity in the gulf of mexico remains weak  which is an unfavorable trend because of the company s presence in this geographic market 
in addition  the prices of oil and natural gas are slightly lower in the first two months of than in the comparable period in if this trend continues  the result may be lower activity levels among our customers  which would have a negative impact on our near term results 
the company s response to these known uncertainties has been to maintain a high cash balance and make selective capital expenditures in areas where we believe there is a higher likelihood of strong customer activity  such as the rocky mountains and in selected markets in the middle east 
in addition to these known uncertainties impacting the near term outlook for our business  our results could also be impacted by the strength of the recovery in the us economy  renewed tensions in the middle east and other oil producing nations  and the weather in the united states during critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating accounting estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  trends in the industry  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may not be collected in the future 
substantially all of the company s receivables are due from oil and gas exploration and production companies in the united states  selected international locations and foreign  nationally owned oil companies 
we have established credit evaluation procedures that seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers 
our customers ability to pay is directly related to their ability to generate cash flow on their projects and is significantly affected by the volatility in the price of oil and natural gas 
the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s evaluation of the overall trends in the oil and gas industry  financial condition of our customers  our historical experience  and in the case of foreign customers  our judgments about the economic and political environment of the related country and region 
historically  we have had favorable collections experience with most of our customers 
income taxes the determination of our income tax provision is complex due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the united states which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
tax regimes in certain jurisdictions are subject to significant changes  which may be applied on a retroactive basis 
if this were to occur  our tax expense could be materially different than the amounts reported 
furthermore  in determining the requirement for any valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets  we estimate taxable income into the future and determine the magnitude of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized 
accrued insurance liabilities the company has exposure to various contingent liabilities and future claims 
the company self insures  up to specified limits  certain risks related to general liability  workers compensation  vehicle and equipment liability  and employee health insurance plan costs 
the cost of claims under these self insurance programs is estimated and accrued as the claims are incurred  although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods 
these claims are monitored and the cost estimates are revised as developments occur relating to such claims 
to estimate the ultimate cost of the claims  the company applies loss development factors to its outstanding claims and uses its experience and  where appropriate  the advice of outside counsel or other experts 
the non current portion of these estimated outstanding claims is classified as long term accrued insurance expenses 
upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  our future financial results will be impacted by the difference between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle the liabilities 
depreciable life of assets the selection of the useful lives of many of the assets requires the judgment of our personnel to estimate the length of their useful lives 
to the extent that the estimate differs from the actual life of the assets  our future financial results could be impacted by any changes to the depreciable lives 
we believe the current estimates of the useful lives are reasonable 
pension liabilities pension costs are actuarially determined and affected by assumptions including the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets and other factors 
the company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
the company utilizes the moody s aa long term corporate bond yield as a basis for determining the discount rate with a yield adjustment made for the longer duration of the company s obligations 
the company evaluates its assumption regarding the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets based on its historical experience and future expectation on investment returns and asset allocation 
the company chooses a rate of return on plan assets that it believes is an appropriate long term average return 
the expected return on plan assets takes into account estimated future investment returns for various asset classes held in the plans portfolio 
to the extent changes are required in the assumptions discussed above  the company s recorded liabilities may have to be adjusted and may result in a material impact to the results of operations

for the year ended december   consolidated revenues increased percent compared to last year as a result of higher utilization of equipment and personnel  increased pricing in most of our service lines and the impact of the bronco oilfield services acquisition completed at the beginning of the second quarter 
during  the average domestic rig count increased percent compared to the average price of natural gas increased percent during compared to  while the average price of oil increased percent during the same period 
this increase in oil and gas prices had a positive impact on our financial results especially the greater increase in gas prices  because we believe that our activity levels are affected more by natural gas prices than by the price of oil 
although the prices of oil and natural gas in were significantly higher than in  the higher prices and the increase in drilling activity did not correlate as closely as in past cycles 
if this continues  then it is possible that rising oil and gas prices in the future may not necessarily indicate an increase in our activity levels  as they have historically 
technical services revenues increased percent for the year ended december  compared to the prior year as a result of higher utilization of equipment and personnel  increased pricing in most service lines and the impact of the bronco oilfield services acquisition completed at the beginning of the second quarter 
support services revenues increased percent for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  as a result of higher utilization of equipment slightly offset by a decrease in pricing 
part of this revenue increase was due to increased utilization of the company s marine liftboats  which were involved in a long term  non oilfield related project during most of support services revenues experienced a relatively lower revenue increase than technical services due to this segment s presence in the gulf of mexico geographic market 
drilling activity in the gulf of mexico was much weaker than in other parts of the us domestic market  and as measured by the rig count  declined during as compared to cost of services rendered and goods sold 
cost of services rendered and goods sold was  in compared to  in  an percent increase 
as a percentage of revenues  these costs decreased from percent in to percent in because of higher utilization of equipment and personnel 
cost of services rendered and goods sold for technical services was  in compared to  in  a percent increase 
this increase was due to higher customer activity levels in compared to  because many of these costs vary directly with activity levels 
in particular  materials and supplies expense within this segment increased in compared to  because of increases in revenues in several service lines within the technical services segment which require a large amount of materials for their operations  including pressure pumping and coiled tubing 
cost of services rendered and goods sold in the support services segment was  in compared to  in  a percent increase 
this increase was due to increases in insurance expense  particularly related to the marine liftboats  and higher overtime personnel expense 
cost of services rendered and goods sold in this segment increased less than in technical services due to the relatively fixed nature of some of the personnel and equipment expenses in many of the services within support services 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in compared to  in this increase of  or percent  was due to higher personnel and incentive compensation expense consistent with increased activity levels and profitability  and increased pension expense relating to the company s pension plan obligation

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
rpc generated revenues of  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or percent 
revenues decreased as a result of weak drilling activity domestically and the shut down of operations in algeria and venezuela early in the second quarter  which were previously our largest international operations 
the assets and personnel involved in these operations related to both the technical and support services business segments and were re deployed to the extent possible in our domestic market areas 
the domestic rig count continued the decline begun in the fourth quarter of and hit a low of early in the second quarter of the average domestic rig count was in compared to  in  a percent decrease 
although oil prices increased percent from the first quarter to the fourth quarter and natural gas prices rose percent during the same period  the rise in commodity prices failed to lead to a significant increase in drilling activity during the year 
some of the factors causing this continued depressed activity during were us domestic economic weakness  global political uncertainty  and a warmer than average winter 
cost of services rendered and goods sold 
cost of services rendered and goods sold was  in compared to  in  a percent decrease 
this decrease was due to lower customer activity levels and rpc s cost reduction efforts 
cost of services rendered and goods sold increased from percent of revenues in to percent in this percentage increase resulted from lower utilization of equipment and personnel during the period and because of the fixed nature of many of these expenses 
the rate of decline in cost of services rendered and goods sold was lower than the corresponding rate of decline in revenues  because of weaker industry conditions  resulting in significantly lower pricing for our services 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing throughout  the company made efforts to reduce its costs of providing services including reducing its employee headcount 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in compared to  in this decrease of  or percent  was primarily the result of decreased employment costs from expense reduction efforts prompted by reduced revenues and reduction in activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues increased from percent in to percent in the decrease also resulted from the elimination of several small non oilfield business units which did not incur expenses during selling  general and administrative expenses also declined as a result of the shut down of our operations in algeria and venezuela and the deployment of those resources to lower cost operating environments 
however  the rate of decline in selling  general and administrative expenses was lower than the rate of decline in revenues  due to the fixed nature of many of these expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization were  in  an increase of  or percent compared to  in the increase in depreciation and amortization resulted from the cumulative effect of the higher levels of growth capital expenditures made during the past few years  offset slightly by relatively lower capital expenditures during and the cessation of goodwill amortization 
beginning in  rpc ceased amortizing goodwill pursuant to sfas in  the amortization of goodwill was approximately  operating profit loss 
operating loss was  in  a decrease of  compared to an operating profit of  in this significant decline resulted from an overall weakening in industry conditions  offset somewhat by rpc s cost reduction efforts  as discussed above 
interest expense income  net 
interest expense was  in compared to  in rpc s interest expense relates to notes payable to the former owners of acquired businesses  and is offset by interest income from investment of its available cash 
rpc s available cash is invested in short term marketable debt securities 
the increase in interest expense  net of interest income  was due to notes associated with acquisitions consummated in  lower investment returns due to declining interest rates  and lower cash and marketable securities balances during see liquidity and capital resources for additional explanations 
other income  net

income tax provision benefit 
the effective income tax rate for was percent while the rate for was percent 
the slight decrease in the effective tax rate is due to the effect of permanant tax differences between book and taxable income 
income loss from continuing operations net of income taxes 
rpc s loss from continuing operations was  a decrease of  compared to an income of  in this decline is consistent with the decreases in operating profit 
income from discontinued operation net of income taxes 
rpc realized no income or loss from the discontinued operation in  compared to net income from discontinued operation of  in this decrease is due to the spin off of rpc s powerboat manufacturing segment in february  which was classified as a discontinued operation during liquidity and capital resources in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used for investing activities    net cash used for financing activities    in february  the company spun off its powerboat manufacturing segment in a tax free spin off 
historically  the powerboat manufacturing segment generated more cash than it needed to fund its operations and the excess was transferred to rpc 
subsequent to the spin off  any excess cash generated by the spun off segment is no longer available to the company 
the company s decisions about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing purposes are influenced by our capital position and the amount of cash expected to be provided by operations 
the company s available liquidity is used to fund expansion of our working capital as business activity levels increase  to fund growth and maintenance capital expenditures and to fund acquisitions of businesses 
in addition  the company uses its liquidity to pay dividends to its common stockholders and to repurchase common stock on the open market 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided from operations and debt financing provided by sellers of acquired businesses  supplemented where needed  by access to a million credit facility  of which million is currently available  with a financial institution encompassing letters of credit and a demand note 
the credit facility is renewable annually with interest payable monthly on outstanding advances under the demand note generally at libor plus basis points 
the portion of the credit facility that is not currently available supports letters of credits relating to self insurance programs or contract bids 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at february  generally we have not maintained balances under this bank note for extended periods of time 
unless we were to make a large  strategic business acquisition  we do not currently anticipate maintaining large outstanding debt balances in the future 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and throughout  the company reduced its capital expenditure levels in response to weaker industry conditions and uncertainty with regard to the timing of a recovery in customer activity levels 
during  the company increased its capital expenditures for operating equipment in order to take advantage of improving industry conditions 
in addition  the company has been assessing current operations and focusing on reducing costs to enhance the company s financial performance 
due to improving industry conditions and the corresponding ability to generate more cash from operating activities  the company anticipates increasing its capital expenditures to approximately million during  however  based on industry conditions management will adjust the level of expenditures to the extent it deems advisable 
cash provided by operating activities in increased  or percent  compared to cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to improved operating results coupled with receipt of a tax refund in the third quarter of resulting from carryback of prior year net operating losses 
these increases were partially offset by higher working capital requirements during the current year including an increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenues partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities consistent with higher business activity levels 
cash used in investing activities for increased  or percent  compared to  primarily as a result of increased capital expenditures with improved business conditions and the acquisition completed during the second quarter of in accordance with the respective purchase agreements of certain business acquisitions  earnout payments to sellers of acquired businesses may be paid on an annual basis and are recorded as goodwill when the earnout payment amounts are determinable 
earnout payments were made to sellers of acquired businesses totaling  in and  in  and were recorded as an increase to the purchase price of the respective business 
estimated earnouts totaling  have been recorded as of december  as additional goodwill and will be paid in early cash used in financing activities for increased  or percent  compared to the increase is primarily as a result of lower debt service requirements partially offset by higher repurchases in the open market of the company s stock 
the company purchased  shares of its common stock on the open market during under a plan authorized by its board of directors  the company has purchased an aggregate of  shares of its common stock on the open market during the current and prior periods and can purchase up to  additional shares 
at the january  board of directors meeting  the board approved a percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend  from to to common shareholders of record on february  payable march  at this meeting  the board also approved an increase of million shares to the previous stock repurchase program 
the prices for oil and natural gas remain historically strong  but until recently  have failed to lead to an increase in drilling activity 
prices have also been volatile in the last several quarters  due to uncertainties over the conflict in the middle east and fluctuating natural gas storage levels 
although the weekly domestic rig count has increased  the company still believes that the operating environment for our services is uncertain in the near term 
as a result of this uncertainty  rpc is monitoring customer exploration and production activity levels very closely  and is only making capital expenditures to support known customer requirements or to maintain our existing fleet of operating equipment 
the company s retirement income plan  a trusteed defined benefit pension plan  provides monthly benefits upon retirement at age to eligible employees 
in conjunction with the spin off of chaparral in february  the company and marine products entered into an employee benefits agreement that provides for marine products to continue participating in the plan 
as of february   the plan became a multiple employer plan  with marine products as an adopting employer 
in the first quarter of  the company s board of directors approved a resolution to cease all future retirement benefit accruals under the retirement income plan effective march  however  the adverse conditions in the equity markets  along with the low interest rate environment  have had an unfavorable impact on the funded status of the company s defined benefit pension plan 
additional contributions to the pension plan of approximately  will be required in to achieve the company s funding objectives 
we believe the liquidity provided by our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least december  we believe our liquidity and overall strong capital position will allow us to continue to grow and provide the opportunity to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise

the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to entities created prior to january  in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after december  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the company has not entered into any agreements subject to fin since january  and does not have any agreements in place that were executed prior to january  that will be subject to the interpretation s provisions when it becomes fully effective in the first quarter of as a result  the company believes the adoption of the interpretation will not have an impact on the financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk rpc maintains an investment portfolio  comprised of us government  corporate and municipal debt securities  which is subject to interest rate risk exposure 
as of december   we are not subject to material interest rate risk exposure on these securities since they are highly liquid with maturities of three months or less 
the company has been affected by the impact of lower interest rates on interest income from its short term investments 
this risk is managed through conservative policies to invest in high quality obligations 
also  as of december   rpc had debt with variable interest rates that exposes rpc to certain market risks 
rpc has performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis related to the debt instruments using a duration model over the near term of the securities and the term of the debt with a percent change in interest rates 
rpc is not subject to material interest rate risk exposure based on this analysis  and no material changes in market risk exposures or how those risks are managed is expected 
as of december   rpc had accounts receivable of approximately million net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
rpc is subject to a concentration of credit risk because most of the accounts receivable are due from companies in the oil and gas industry
