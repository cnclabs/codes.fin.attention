item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
the information contained below may be subject to risk factors 
we urge you to review carefully the section risk factors in part  item of this form k for a more complete discussion of the risks associated with an investment in our securities 
see note on forward looking statements and risk factors under item overview our continuing operations derive revenues from our health maintenance organization  or hmo  managed indemnity plans and military health care services 
to a lesser extent  we also derive revenues from professional fees consisting primarily of fees for providing health care services to non members  co payment fees received from members and ancillary products  and investment and other revenue consisting of fees for workers compensation third party administration  utilization management services and ancillary products 
our principal expenses consist of medical expenses  military contract expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
medical expenses represent capitation fees and other fee for service payments paid to independent contracted physicians  hospitals and other health care providers to cover members  pharmacy costs  as well as the aggregate expenses to operate and manage our wholly owned multi specialty medical group and other provider subsidiaries 
as a provider of health care management services  we seek to positively affect quality of care and expenses by contracting with physicians  hospitals and other health care providers at negotiated price levels  by adopting quality assurance programs  monitoring and managing utilization of physician and hospital services and providing incentives to use cost effective providers 
military contract expenses represent payments to providers for health care services rendered under the tricare program  as well as administrative costs to operate the military health care subsidiary 
general and administrative expenses generally represent operational costs other than those directly associated with the delivery of health care services and military contract services 
executive summary continuing operations 
our operating results were significantly improved over our fully diluted income from continuing operations per common share increased by to and our income from continuing operations increased by to million 
the improvement in the operating results was primarily driven by medical premium revenue growth from new members  rate increases and an expansion of our operating margin 
our hmo membership increased by from  at december  to  at december  our overall premium rates increased by approximately over the combination of these factors resulted in a increase in our medical premium revenues to million 
our medical expenses  on the other hand  only increased by to million 
medical expenses  as a percentage of medical premiums and professional fees  decreased to from  or basis points 
in addition  our general and administrative expenses only increased by to million 
as a percentage of total revenues  our general and administration expense ratio was reduced by basis points to 
our operating margin  which is the operating income from continuing operations divided by total revenues  improved by basis points to 
our military health services operations segment represented of our operating revenues and of our operating income from continuing operations 
this segment had income before income taxes of million in compared to million in however  if we exclude the t nex related expenses  the military health services operations segment would have had income before income taxes of million in compared to million in the improvement was due to greater administrative operating expense efficiencies 
we did not win the t nex north region contract and our appeal to the united states general accounting office was denied in december health care services under our current tricare contract for region will end on august  and we will then have a six month phase out at substantially reduced revenues and earnings 
our cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations increased by to million and were mainly attributable to the increase in net income 
in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due march   paid off our old credit facility balance and obtained a new million revolving credit facility  which we have not yet utilized 
the senior convertible debentures can be converted into million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
to help compensate for the potential dilution of the senior convertible debentures  we purchased  as of december   at prevailing prices in the open market by block purchase or private transactions  million shares at an average cost of per share 
in january  we obtained an amendment to our credit facility to allow for up to million of additional purchases of our common stock and as of march   we have purchased an additional  shares for million 
discontinued operations 
during the third quarter of  we announced our plan to exit the texas hmo health care market and received formal approval from the texas department of insurance to withdraw our hmo operations in mid october we ceased providing hmo health care coverage in texas on april  as part of our plan to exit texas  in the third quarter of  we recorded a charge of million for premium deficiency costs  the write down of certain assets  legal and restitution costs  and various other exit related costs 
we elected to early adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas no 
 effective january  in accordance with sfas no 
 beginning january   our texas hmo health care operations were reclassified and presented as discontinued operations 
on january   we announced that we were exploring strategic alternatives to dispose of cii 
sierra s board of directors approved the sale of the operations on december  accordingly  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we reclassified our workers compensation insurance business as discontinued operations 
in conjunction with the decision to sell the workers compensation operations at the end of  cii recorded valuation adjustments of million  million after tax  to reduce this business to its estimated net realizable value upon disposition 
the valuation adjustments included the write down of accounts receivable  fixed assets and certain other assets of million  and additional loss reserves of million for the accident year and million for prior accident years 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million  million after tax  in additional valuation adjustments 
on november   we announced that we had reached an agreement to sell california indemnity insurance company  or cal indemnity  and its subsidiaries 
cal indemnity is a wholly owned subsidiary of cii and is cii s only significant asset 
as part of the purchase agreement  cal indemnity and its subsidiaries have stopped issuing new or renewal policies except in nevada 
the buyer intends to place cal indemnity and its subsidiaries in run off 
an independent third party claims administrator has been engaged to administer the claims when the transaction is consummated 
the transaction was initially valued at million  consisting of million payable at closing and a contingent payment of million which will be payable in the cash payable at closing is subject to certain adjustments and the contingent payment can be increased or decreased based upon favorable or adverse loss and allocated loss adjustment expense development from closing through december we have currently estimated that the adjustments will reduce the net sales proceeds to approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million  gross and net of tax  to write down the investment in cal indemnity to its estimated net sales proceeds 
the sale is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close by april  results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended decembe r  operating revenues medical premiums military contract revenues professional fees investment and other revenues total operating expenses medical expenses military contract expenses general and administrative expenses total operating income from continuing operations interest expense other income expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income year ended december  compared to total operating revenues increased approximately to billion from billion for the change in operating revenues was comprised of the following an increase in medical premiums of million an increase in military contract revenues of million an increase in professional fees of million an increase in investment and other revenues of million medical premiums from our hmo and managed indemnity insurance subsidiaries increased from million to million  an increase of million or 
the increase in premium revenue reflects a increase in medicare member months the number of months individuals are enrolled in a plan  a increase in medicaid member months and a increase in commercial member months 
the growth in medicare member months contributes significantly to the increase in premium revenues as the medicare per member premium rates are more than three times higher than the average commercial premium rate 
hmo and pos premium rates for renewing commercial groups increased approximately while the overall recorded per member per month revenue increase  including new and continuing business  was approximately 
managed indemnity rates on renewing groups increased approximately 
we did not receive a medicaid rate increase in or the basic medicare rate increase received in was approximately 
our overall medicare rate increase was approximately due primarily to an increase in the social hmo membership as a percentage of our total medicare membership 
effective january  the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  has adopted a new risk adjustment payment methodology for medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in managed care programs  including the social hmo 
in addition  cms has revised the payment factors for the social hmo members to include a frailty adjuster that uses measures of functional impairment to predict expenditures 
under the new payment methodology  in  we will be paid based on the current payment approach and based on the new approach 
the social hmo program was due to expire at the end of  however cms administratively extended the social hmo program for one year  through if the social hmo contract is not renewed beyond  we would seek to transfer the members into one of our traditional medicare plans 
this transfer would allow for the continuity of care of our members but without the additional social hmo specific benefits that are currently available to them and the associated higher premiums we receive 
there are activities taking place on a federal level to continue the program  but there is no guarantee at this time that the social hmo contract will be renewed beyond continued medical premium revenue growth is principally dependent upon continued enrollment in our products and upon competitive and regulatory factors 
under the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  or mma  and effective march  we have calculated that the mma will increase our medicare premium rates by over 
the increased funding must be used in one or more of the following ways to reduce beneficiary premiums  reduce beneficiary cost sharing  enhance benefits  placed into a benefit stabilization fund  or used to retain providers or expand the provider network as long as the provider network stabilization or enhancement does not result in increased premiums  increased cost sharing or reduced benefits 
we proposed to use the additional funding to enhance various plan benefits  including a reduction in the amount of medicare part b premium that our members pay to the federal government  and to stabilize our provider network 
our commercial membership increased from  at december  to  at december  in the first two months of  we have added almost  additional members 
our commercial member retention was approximately for our january renewals  which represent approximately of our total commercial membership 
the increase in commercial membership during is primarily attributed to in case growth  movement from self insured plans to our commercial products and new accounts 
military contract revenues increased from million to million  an increase of million or 
included in the total military contract revenues are incremental change order and bid price adjustments for and of million and million  respectively 
the increase in revenue is the result of higher base contract revenue primarily due to increased eligible beneficiaries from the call up of reservists in region and their family members who are eligible for the tricare program after days and the positive impact of the first year of our contract extension  which began june the base monthly revenue under the contract extension is higher than it was under the previous contract 
there were no final settlements of bid price adjustments in or smhs completed the fifth year of a five year contract in may and is in the first year of a contract extension 
in august  the dod requested proposals for managed care services under the next generation tricare  or t nex  contract 
we submitted our proposal in january for the t nex north region contract  which includes region  as well as michigan  ohio  kentucky  indiana  illinois  wisconsin  virginia and north carolina 
however  in august  the dod awarded the t nex north region contract to a competitor and the general accounting office denied our protest of the award in december the new contractor is scheduled to be operational in region on september  and the new contract would supersede the remainder of our current tricare region contract 
after the new contractor is operational on september   smhs will commence a six month phase out of operations at prices previously negotiated with the dod 
smhs does not meet the definition of discontinued operations since we do not have plans to dispose of the operations before the phase out is complete 
for more detail on smhs results of operations see note  segment reporting  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
professional fees increased from million to million  an increase of million  or as a result of increased visits due to membership growth  a higher percentage of members selecting our owned medical group and an increase in related services performed by our other provider subsidiaries 
investment and other revenues increased from million to million  an increase of million or 
investment revenues increased due to higher average invested balances  an increase in net gains on the sale of investments of  and an increase in revenues associated with administrative services of million 
medical expenses increased from million to million  an increase of million or 
the increase is due primarily to our increased membership  which is in part offset by a lower medical care ratio 
this ratio  which is medical expenses as a percentage of medical premiums and professional fees  decreased to from 
the favorable decrease in our medical care ratio is due primarily to premium increases in excess of cost increases  lower average cost per hospital bed day as a result of a new hospital contract we entered into in the third quarter of  favorable pharmacy costs and favorable claims development from prior periods 
the favorable decrease was partially offset by malpractice cost increases at our medical provider subsidiary 
the number of days in claims payable  which is the medical claims payable balance divided by the average medical expense per day for the period  at december  was compared to at december  our medical claims payable liability requires us to make significant estimates 
any changes to the estimates would be reflected in the year the adjustments are made 
included in medical expenses is favorable development on prior years estimates of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the favorable development is a result of claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated 
we contract with hospitals  physicians and other independent contracted providers of health care under capitated or discounted fee for service arrangements  including hospital per diems  to provide medical care services to members 
capitated providers are at risk for a portion of the cost of medical care services provided to our members in the relevant geographic areas  however  we are ultimately responsible for the provision of services to our members should the capitated provider be unable to provide the contracted services 
we incurred capitation expenses of million and million  or and  of our total medical expenses for and  respectively 
military contract expenses increased from million to million  an increase of million or 
the increase is consistent with the increase in revenues discussed previously and includes million in t nex related costs for compared to million in health care delivery expense consists primarily of costs to provide managed health care services to eligible beneficiaries in accordance with sierra s tricare contract 
under the contract  smhs provides health care services to approximately  eligible individuals of active duty military personnel  military retirees under the age of and dependents of military retirees through a network of approximately  health care providers and certain other subcontractor partnerships 
also included in military contract expenses are costs incurred to perform specific administrative services  such as health care appointment scheduling  enrollment  medical and network management services as well as health care advice line services  and other administrative functions of the military health care subsidiary 
these administrative services are performed for active duty personnel and family members as well as retired military families 
included in military contract expenses is favorable development of prior years estimates having an earnings impact of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  favorable development of prior years estimates having a non earnings impact were million and million for and  respectively 
the non earnings impact was offset by a reduction in military contract revenues pursuant to the gain loss risk sharing with the government 
the favorable development was a result of claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated 
general and administrative expenses  or g a  increased from million to million  an increase of approximately million or 
g a expenses increased due to increases in payroll and benefits and facility lease expense partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses 
the increase in facility lease expense is due to the rent payments associated with the sale leaseback transaction for our administrative buildings now being recorded as an operating expense 
previously  the rent payments were recorded as interest and a reduction of principal and the assets were being depreciated 
as a percentage of revenues  g a expenses were for  compared to in as result of the items described above and the overall increase in revenues 
as a percentage of medical premium revenue  g a expenses were for  compared to for due to the overall increase in medical premium revenue 
interest expense decreased from million to million  a decrease of approximately million or 
interest expense related to the sale leaseback transaction decreased by approximately million as the remaining buildings qualified as a sale during the decrease in the interest expense related to our revolving credit facility was primarily offset by an increase in interest related to the new senior convertible debentures 
we currently incur a fee of on the unused portion of our new revolving credit facility 
other income expense  net resulted in expense of approximately  for compared to income of approximately  for provision for income taxes was recorded at million for compared to million for the effective tax rate for was compared to for our effective tax rate is greater than the statutory rate due primarily to an increase in state income taxes 
discontinued operations consist of our texas hmo health care operations and the cii workers compensation operations 
the net loss from discontinued operations for was approximately million compared to million for the texas hmo health care operations had net income of approximately million for  which was offset by a net loss on the cii workers compensation operations of million 
discontinued texas hmo health care operations 
the income from the texas hmo health care operations for included a pre tax gain on the early payoff of the remaining kaiser texas mortgage loan of million  a net decrease in litigation accruals of million and  favorable development in medical claim liabilities of million partially offset by a loss on the sale write down of real estate of approximately  and other operating expense and adjustments of million 
the combined adjustments resulted in income from the discontinued texas hmo health care operations of million pre tax or net income of million 
discontinued cii workers compensation operations 
the discontinued workers compensation operations for had a net loss of million 
net earned premiums decreased by million or due primarily to a decrease in direct earned premiums of million and an increase in ceded reinsurance premiums of million partially offset by an increase in assumed premiums of approximately  investment and other revenue decreased by million or due to a decrease in the average investment yields during the period 
in conjunction with the decision to sell the workers compensation operations at the end of  cii recorded valuation adjustments of million  million after tax  to reduce this business to its estimated net realizable value upon disposition 
the valuation adjustments included the write down of accounts receivable  fixed assets and certain other assets of million  and additional loss reserves of million for the accident year and million for prior accident years 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million  million after tax  in additional valuation adjustments 
on november   we announced that we had reached an agreement to sell cal indemnity and its subsidiaries 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million  gross and net of tax  to write down the investment in cal indemnity to its estimated net sales proceeds 
we did not recognize a tax benefit on the charge since our tax basis was less than our investment in cal indemnity 
the sale is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close by april  excluding the million charge  expenses decreased in the cii workers compensation operations by approximately million or 
the decrease is primarily due to the following in  we recorded million of net adverse loss development for prior accident years compared to net adverse loss development of million recorded in the net adverse loss development recorded in was largely attributable to higher costs per claim  or claim severity  in california  primarily on accident years except higher claim severity has had a negative impact on the entire california workers compensation industry in the past few periods and this trend may continue 
the loss and loss adjustment expense  or lae  ratio for the accident year compared to the accident year was lower by  which resulted in a decrease in loss and lae of approximately million 
the reduction is primarily related to our premium rate increases 
a million reduction in loss and lae is related to the decrease in net earned premiums in compared to the net decrease in underwriting expenses  policyholders dividends and other operating expenses was approximately million and is attributable to the lower premium revenue for the period 
the net adverse loss development on prior accident years included those years that were covered by our reinsurance agreements 
this resulted in an increase in the reinsurance recoverable balance  which was then reduced by amounts collected from reinsurers 
for the year ended december   we increased our ceded reserves by million and received payments from our reinsurers totaling million 
the loss and lae reserves recorded as of december  reflect our best estimate of the ultimate loss costs for reported and unreported claims occurring in accident year as well as those occurring in accident years prior to workers compensation claim payments are made over several years from the date of the claim 
until the final payments for reported claims are made  reserves are invested to generate investment income 
the combined ratio is a measurement of the workers compensation underwriting profit or loss and is the sum of the loss and lae ratio  underwriting expense ratio and policyholders dividend ratio 
a combined ratio of less than indicates an underwriting profit 
our combined ratio was compared to for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the loss and lae ratio 
excluding prior accident years adverse loss development  the combined ratio would have been for and for new california workers compensation insurance reform legislation was signed into law in september to address some of the cost drivers that have led to significantly higher workers compensation insurance premium rates over the past three years 
the workers compensation insurance rating bureau  or wcirb  has preliminarily indicated that the reform legislation will reduce the loss costs by an average of to 
prior to the enactment of the legislation  the wcirb had indicated that loss costs should increase by an average of 
we have not adjusted our reserving methods and there is no assurance that our rates are adequate given the inherent uncertainties in any new legislation 
in the wake of the events of september  and the ensuing hardening of the reinsurance market  our new reinsurance agreements  which cover new and renewal policies effective on and after january   have reduced coverage limits and exclusions for terrorist acts 
we continue to retain the first  per occurrence but the maximum coverage has been reduced from statutory ie  unlimited limits to million per occurrence 
we also must meet certain annual aggregate deductibles before we can begin to recover from some of our reinsurers 
this new coverage will result in our retaining more of the losses and lae 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our obligations to injured workers or policyholders 
at december   we had million in reinsurance recoverable 
we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
we also periodically review the financial strength ratings of our reinsurers to determine if an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is warranted 
as of december   no allowance was established 
at december   all of our reinsurers were rated a or better by fitch ratings th of and the am best company th of 
should these companies be unable to perform their obligations to reimburse us for ceded losses  we would experience significant losses 
year ended december  compared to total operating revenues increased approximately to billion from billion for the change in operating revenues was comprised of the following an increase in medical premiums of million an increase in military contract revenues of million an increase in professional fees of million a decrease in investment and other revenues of approximately  medical premiums from our hmo and managed indemnity insurance subsidiaries increased from million to million  an increase of million or 
the increase in premium revenue reflects a increase in medicare member months the number of months individuals are enrolled in a plan  a increase in medicaid member months and a increase in commercial member months 
the growth in medicare member months contributes significantly to the increase in premium revenues as the medicare per member premium rates are more than three times higher than the average commercial premium rate 
military contract revenues increased from million to million  an increase of million or 
the increase in revenue is primarily the result of additive change order work and is significantly offset by increased military contract expenses associated with those change orders 
in addition  the revenue included final bid price adjustments on the first two completed option periods of the tricare region contract 
the final adjustments resulted in revenue reductions of approximately  for option period june to may  which is of the final revenue settlement amount for that period and million for option period june to may  which is of the final revenue settlement amount for that period 
the impact on the net income for the final bid price adjustments for the first two completed option periods  net of corresponding expense adjustments noted below  was a reduction of million 
there were no final settlements of bid price adjustments in the dod fiscal year budget included several sweeping changes to the tricare program 
in april  smhs began implementation of a prescription drug program for beneficiaries over age likewise  in october  smhs implemented tricare for life  which is a comprehensive health care benefit to those retired military beneficiaries age and over 
both of these modifications resulted from congressional changes to the program 
smhs administers the expanded benefits only to the over age retiree military population 
smhs does not directly fund claims payment or bear any health care underwriting risk on these program modifications for the actual level of health care service utilization and does not record any claim payments or related revenue on these program modifications 
professional fees increased from million to million  an increase of million or as a result of higher average co pays and increased visits at our provider subsidiaries 
investment and other revenues decreased from million to million  a decrease of approximately  or due primarily to a decrease in the average investment yield during the period offset by an increase in the average invested balance 
medical expenses increased from million to million  an increase of million or due primarily to our increased membership 
medical expenses  as a percentage of medical premiums and professional fees  decreased to from 
the decrease is primarily due to premium yields in excess of cost and utilization increases and favorable claims development from prior periods  which were partially offset by higher bed days in included in medical expenses is favorable development on prior years estimates of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the favorable development is a result of claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated

our average interest rate on the revolving credit facility  excluding the amortization of deferred financing fees  our interest rate swap agreement and fees on the unused portion of the credit facility was in  compared to in we incurred a fee of on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
interest expense related to the sale leaseback transaction decreased by million as the remaining buildings qualified as a sale during we had various increases in interest expense of approximately  other income expense  net increased million primarily due to a net loss on sale of assets of million in provision for income taxes was recorded at million for compared to million for the effective tax rate for was compared to for our ongoing effective tax rate is less than the statutory rate due primarily to tax preferred investments 
discontinued operations consist of our texas hmo health care operations and the cii workers compensation operations 
the loss from discontinued operations for was million compared to million for the texas hmo health care operations had a gain of million for  which was offset by a loss on the cii workers compensation operations of million 
discontinued texas hmo health care operations 
the gain from the texas hmo health care operations for included gains  net of tax  related to reserves and accrued liabilities of million and to real estate of million 
during  we had favorable development in both medical claims and legal  restitution and other exit related costs 
as a result  we reduced our estimate for medical claims payable by million and our legal  restitution and other exit related costs by million 
the adjustments resulted in income  net of tax  from the discontinued texas hmo health care operations of million 
during  txhc sold four real estate properties and a piece of land  which resulted in a gain  net of tax  on the sale of approximately  in conjunction with the sales  we were required  under the terms of the mortgage loan agreement  to pay pre determined minimum amounts of the mortgage note 
since the principal payments resulted in a reduction of future interest  future accrued interest was reduced and a gain  net of tax  of million was recorded 
discontinued cii workers compensation operations 
the discontinued workers compensation operations for had a loss of million compared to a profit of million in the results included valuation adjustments of million  or million after tax 
net earned premiums increased by million or due primarily to a decrease in ceded reinsurance premiums of million that was partially offset by a million decrease in gross earned premiums 
gross written premiums decreased by million due primarily to reduced california premium writings 
expenses increased in the cii workers compensation operations by approximately million or 
the increase in expenses is primarily due to the following in conjunction with the decision to dispose of the workers compensation operations  cii recorded valuation adjustments  which included the write down of accounts receivable  fixed assets and certain other assets of million and an increase in loss and lae reserves of million 
approximately million in additional loss and lae was related to the increase in net earned premiums in compared to in  we recorded million of net adverse loss development for prior accident years compared to net adverse loss development of million recorded in of the million recorded  million is related to our mandatory participation in assumed reinsurance pools and million was recorded in conjunction with the valuation adjustments described above 
the net adverse loss development recorded was largely attributable to higher costs per claim  or claim severity  in california  primarily on accident years   and the loss and lae ratio for the accident year was higher by which resulted in an increase of approximately million in additional losses including the million recorded as part of the valuation adjustments 
excluding the valuation adjustment  which represents of net earned premiums  the accident year loss and lae ratio would have been less than the accident year loss ratio 
the decrease is due to the higher premium rates  which were substantially offset by higher estimated average incurred claims 
the net decrease in underwriting expenses  policyholders dividends and other operating expenses  excluding the valuation adjustments  was approximately  the net adverse loss development on prior accident years included those years that were covered by our low level reinsurance agreement 
this resulted in an increase in the reinsurance recoverable balance  which is then reduced by amounts collected from reinsurers 
during the year ended december   we increased our ceded reserves by million and received payments from our reinsurers totaling million 
the combined ratio is a measurement of the workers compensation underwriting profit or loss and is the sum of the loss and lae ratio  underwriting expense ratio and policyholders dividend ratio 
a combined ratio of less than indicates an underwriting profit 
our combined ratio  net of valuation adjustments of  was compared to for the increase was primarily due to increased net adverse loss development for prior accident years 
excluding valuation adjustments and prior accident years adverse loss development  the combined ratio would have been for and for liquidity and capital resources we had cash flows from operating activities for continuing operations of million for the year ended december  compared to million in we used the majority of the cash flow for the repurchase of the company s common stock and for capital expenditures 
the improvement in cash flows from continuing operations over is primarily attributable to cash from earnings and the change in operating assets and liabilities 
the cash flow resulting from the change in operating assets and liabilities of million was primarily due to the following a source of cash due to the decrease in the deferred tax asset balance of million a source of cash due to the increase in medical claims payable of million a source of cash due to the increase in other liabilities of million a source of cash due to the increase in other current liabilities of million a source of cash due to the increase in military health care payable balance of million a use of cash due to the increase in other assets of million a use of cash due to the increase in other current assets of million various other changes in assets and liabilities accounting for the remaining use of cash of million smhs receives monthly cash payments equivalent to one twelfth of its annual contractual price with the department of defense  or dod 
smhs accrues health care revenue on a monthly basis for any monies owed above its monthly cash receipt based on the number of at risk eligible beneficiaries and the level of military direct care system utilization 
the contractual bid price adjustment  or bpa  process serves to adjust the dod s monthly payments to smhs  because the payments are based in part on dod estimates for beneficiary population and beneficiary population baseline health care cost  inflation and military direct care system utilization 
as actual information becomes available for the above items  quarterly adjustments are made to smhs monthly health care payment in addition to lump sum adjustments for past months 
in addition  smhs accrues change order revenue for dod directed contract changes 
our business and cash flows could be adversely affected if the timing or amount of the bpa and change order reimbursements vary significantly from our expectations 
the loss of the t nex contract will adversely affect our cash flow from operations starting in the fourth quarter of during the phase out period  we expect that smhs will have negative cash from operations as the payout of the remaining liabilities will exceed smhs accounts receivable balance 
net cash used for investing activities of continuing operations during included million in capital expenditures associated with the continued implementation of new computer systems  leasehold improvements on facilities  furniture and equipment and other capital purchases to support our growth 
this was offset by net proceeds of million from property and equipment dispositions 
the net cash change in investments for the year was an increase in investments of million as investments were purchased with available funds 
net cash used for financing activities of continuing operations during included net payments of million on debt related items offset by million in proceeds from the sale of our senior convertible debentures and million from proceeds of other long term debt 
these proceeds were offset by debt issue costs of million 
proceeds from the issuance of stock in connection with stock plans were million 
we used cash of million to purchase treasury stock 
on december   the majority of our las vegas  nevada administrative and medical clinic real estate holdings were sold in a sale leaseback transaction 
as part of the transaction  a portion of the sales price was financed with mortgage notes receivable of million and deposits of million were provided 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  or sfas no 
 we recorded the transaction as a financing obligation of million offset by the mortgage notes receivable of million 
as of september   we had received the deposits back and full payment of the outstanding mortgage obligations 
the payments cured the continuing involvement criteria from sfas no 
and the transaction then qualified as a sale 
discontinued operations used cash of million in  compared to million in cash used in was primarily for the payoff of the remaining kaiser texas mortgage loan for million and the redemption of the outstanding senior debentures for million 
cash used in was primarily for the run out of claims and other legal and restitution related items 
based on the current estimated texas hmo health care run out costs and recorded reserves  we believe we have adequate funds available and the ability to invest  should we be required to do so  adequate funds in texas to meet the anticipated obligations for our former members health care claims 
sierra debentures in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due march  the debentures pay interest  which is due semi annually on march and september of each year 
each  principal amount of debentures is convertible  at the option of the holders  into shares of sierra health services  inc  common stock prior to march  if i the market price of our common stock for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter exceeds of the conversion price per share of our common stock  ii the debentures are called for redemption  iii there is an event of default with respect to the debentures  or iv specified corporate transactions have occurred 
the conversion rate is subject to certain adjustments 
this conversion rate initially represents a conversion price of per share 
holders of the debentures may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures on march in  and or upon certain corporate events including a change in control 
in either case  we may choose to pay the purchase price of such debentures in cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock 
the debentures can be redeemed by us for cash beginning on or after march  the debentures were sold to banc of america securities llc  credit lyonnais securities usa  inc  and us bancorp piper jaffray  in reliance upon the exemption afforded by section of the securities act  and were offered and resold to qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act 
we filed a registration statement under the securities act to permit registered resales of the debentures and the common stock into which the debentures are convertible 
the securities and exchange commission declared this registration statement effective on august  the aggregate offering price of the debentures was million  of the principal amount thereof 
the purchase price paid to the company by the initial purchasers was the initial offering price less a discount of million or of the principal amount of the debentures 
the company used the net proceeds of the offering to repay the million outstanding under the then existing credit facility and to contribute million to smhs 
the company also used million of the proceeds to purchase million shares of the company s common stock under its repurchase program 
the remainder of the net proceeds were used for working capital and general corporate purposes including additional share repurchases 
revolving credit facility on march   we entered into a new million revolving credit facility  which replaced the amended and restated credit facility 
the new facility may be increased up to an aggregate amount of million upon receipt of new commitments from existing or additional lenders 
interest on the facility was initially libor plus and is currently libor plus 
the facility will expire on april   but can be extended  at the sole discretion of each of the lenders  until march  the new facility is available for general corporate purposes 
we have not yet utilized this facility 
the new credit facility is secured by guarantees by certain of our subsidiaries and a first priority perfected security interest in i all the capital stock of each of our unregulated  material domestic subsidiaries direct or indirect as well as all of the capital stock of certain regulated  material domestic subsidiaries  and ii all other present and future assets and properties of ours and those of our subsidiaries that guarantee our credit agreement obligations including  without limitation  accounts receivable  inventory  real property  equipment  contracts  trademarks  copyrights  patents  license rights and general intangibles subject  in each case  to the exclusion of the capital stock of cii financial  inc  or any of its subsidiaries and certain other exclusions 
the new revolving credit facility has covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur indebtedness  incur other liens  make investments  loans or advances  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  repurchase our common stock or make capital expenditures and otherwise restricts certain corporate activities 
in addition  we are required to comply with specified financial ratios as set forth in the new credit agreement 
we believe that we are in compliance with all covenants of the new credit agreement 
sierra share repurchase program as of december   our board of directors had authorized a program for the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
through december   we had purchased  at prevailing prices in the open market by block purchase or private transactions  million shares for million 
as of december   we had board authorization to purchase approximately million shares of common stock 
our new revolving credit facility  as amended  allows for additional stock repurchases of up to million during the remainder of as of march   the company has repurchased an additional  shares for million 
statutory capital and deposit requirements our hmo and insurance subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain certain deposits and must also meet certain net worth and reserve requirements 
the hmo and insurance subsidiaries  including the discontinued operations  had restricted assets on deposit in various states totaling million at december  the hmo and insurance subsidiaries must also meet requirements to maintain minimum stockholders equity  on a statutory basis  as well as minimum risk based capital requirements  which are determined annually 
additionally  in conjunction with the kaiser texas acquisition  txhc entered into a letter agreement with the texas department of insurance whereby txhc agreed to maintain a net worth of million  on a statutory basis  until certain income levels were achieved 
in conjunction with the exit from the texas hmo health care market  the texas department of insurance approved a plan of withdrawal and txhc is now required to maintain deposits of million and net worth of at least million 
we believe we are in material compliance with our regulatory requirements 
of the million in cash and cash equivalents held at december   including discontinued operations  million was held by discontinued operations and of the remainder  million  was designated for use only by the regulated subsidiaries 
amounts are available for transfer to the holding company from the hmo and insurance subsidiaries only to the extent that they can be remitted in accordance with the terms of existing management agreements and by dividends 
the holding company will not receive dividends from its regulated subsidiaries if such dividend payment would cause violation of statutory net worth and reserve requirements 
obligations and commitments the following schedule represents our obligations and commitments for long term debt  capital leases and operating leases at december  the amounts presented below include all future payments associated with each obligation including interest expense 
long term capital operating debt leases leases total in thousands continuing operations payments due in less than year   payments due in to years   payments due in to years   payments due after years   total continuing operations   discontinued operations payments due in less than year payments due in to years  payments due in to years payments due after years total discontinued operations  other we have a capital budget of million and are also limited in the amount of capital expenditures we can purchase by our new revolving credit facility 
the planned expenditures are primarily for a new medical clinic  the purchase of computer hardware and software  furniture and equipment and other normal capital requirements 
our liquidity needs over the next months will primarily be for the capital items noted above and debt service 
we believe that our existing working capital  operating cash flow and  if necessary  equipment leasing  divestitures of certain non core assets and amounts available under our credit facility should be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and debt service 
additionally  subject to unanticipated cash requirements  we believe that our existing working capital and operating cash flow should enable us to meet our liquidity needs on a long term basis 
at december   our chief executive officer  or ceo  had loans outstanding to us in the amount of million with a maturity date of december  during  our ceo paid the entire outstanding balance including accrued interest 
inflation health care costs continue to rise at a rate faster than the consumer price index 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation  including setting commercial premiums based on our anticipated health care costs  risk sharing arrangements with our various health care providers and other health care cost containment measures including member co payments 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the future  our ability to manage medical costs will not be negatively impacted by items such as technological advances  competitive pressures  applicable regulations  increases in pharmacy costs  utilization changes and catastrophic items  which could  in turn  result in medical cost increases equaling or exceeding premium increases 
government regulation our business  offering health care coverage  health care management services  workers compensation programs and  to a lesser extent  the delivery of medical services  is heavily regulated at both the federal and state levels 
government regulation of health care coverage products and services is a dynamic area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
amendments to existing laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretation of the existing laws and rules changes from time to time 
regulatory agencies generally exercise broad discretion in interpreting laws and promulgating regulations to enforce their interpretations 
while we are unable to predict what legislative or regulatory changes may occur or the impact of any particular change  our operations and financial results could be negatively effected by any legislative or regulatory requirements 
for example  any proposals to eliminate or reduce the employee retirement income security act  or erisa  which regulates insured and self insured health care coverage plans offered by employers  pre emption of state laws that would increase litigation exposure  affect underwriting practices  limit rate increases  require new or additional benefits or affect contracting arrangements including proposals to require hmos and ppos to accept any health care provider willing to abide by an hmo s or ppo s contract terms may have a material adverse effect on our business 
the continued consideration and enactment of anti managed care laws and regulations by federal and state bodies may make it more difficult for us to manage medical costs and may adversely affect financial results 
in addition to changes in existing laws and regulations  we are subject to audits  investigations and enforcement actions 
these include possible government actions relating to erisa  the federal employees health benefit plan  or fehbp  federal and state fraud and abuse laws and laws relating to utilization management and the delivery and payment of health care 
in addition  our medicare business is subject to medicare regulations promulgated by cms 
violation of government laws and regulations may result in an assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including exclusion from participation in government programs 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we are required to make judgments  assumptions and estimates  which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances 
these judgments  assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and trends and factor in known and projected trends 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates 
actual results  however  may materially differ from our calculated estimates and this difference would be reported in our current operations 
the following discusses our most critical accounting policies and estimates  which have been reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors 
medical premiums and expenses 
medical premium revenues are recorded in the month when we are obligated to provide services to our enrolled members 
premiums received in advance of the coverage period are recorded as unearned premiums 
our premium revenues are net of an estimate for an allowance for retroactive adjustments 
at december   our allowance for retroactive adjustments for health care premium revenues was million 
retroactive adjustments result from changes in enrollments that relate to prior periods due to delays in processing or reporting by employers 
we use historical trends and known activities to estimate our premium allowances 
any subsequent difference between actual premium adjustments and previously estimated premium adjustments would be reflected in that subsequent year s operating results 
health care medical expenses are recorded in the period when services are provided to enrolled members  including estimates for provider costs  which have been incurred as of the balance sheet date but not yet reported to us 
we use a variety of standard actuarial projection methods to make these estimates and we must use our judgment in selecting development factors and assumed trends 
in making our projections  we consider medical cost utilization and trends  changes in internal processes  the average interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are received and or paid  denied claims activity  disputed claims activity  utilization  seasonality patterns and changes in membership 
our assumptions could be affected by the timing of the receipt of claims  the timing of processing claims and unanticipated changes  such as adverse legal outcomes  legislative or regulatory changes  new interpretations of existing laws or regulations or disputed contract provisions that result in our having to provide new or extended benefits and changes in our health care delivery system or costs 
any subsequent changes in an estimate for a prior year would be reflected in that subsequent year s operating results 
management believes  based on information presently available  that the recorded liability for medical claims payable  which at december   represented of our total consolidated liabilities or million  is reasonable and adequate to cover future health care claim payments 
however  a difference between the recorded liability and actual developed claim payments could have a material impact to our financial results 
for example  a increase in medical claims payable as of december   would reduce reported net income for the year by  or and diluted earnings per share would be reduced by 
military contract revenues and expenses 
military contract revenue is recorded based on the contract price as agreed to by the federal government 
the contract was based on prior years data provided by the government along with assumptions of future trends 
the contract contains provisions that adjust the contract price based on actual experience  which we call the bid price adjustment  or bpa  and for government directed change orders 
for the year ended december   we estimate that approximately million or of the total military contract revenues were for bpa and change orders 
at december   military accounts receivable due from the federal government was million of which approximately million was for accrued bpa and change order revenues 
as the data becomes available from the government  we compare the actual results to the contract assumptions and the estimated effects of these adjustments are recognized on a monthly basis 
in addition  we record revenue based on estimates of the earned portion of any contract change orders not originally specified in the contract 
the bpa and government directed change orders are subject to negotiation and we must use our judgment in making our estimates 
the actual negotiated price could be substantially different from what we had originally estimated 
any subsequent difference would be reported in that subsequent year s operations 
military contract health care costs are recorded in the period when services are provided to eligible beneficiaries  including estimates for provider costs  which have been incurred as of the balance sheet date but not reported to us 
we use a variety of actuarial projection methods to make these estimates and we must use our judgment in selecting development factors and assumed trends 
our assumptions  which are in large part related to the same assumptions we use in estimating military contract revenues  could be affected by unanticipated changes  such as new interpretations of contract provisions that result in our having to provide new or extended benefits and changes in our health care delivery system or costs 
we must also factor into our assumptions the limited risk sharing that we have with the government in providing health care services 
any substantial change in our estimates may to a large degree be mitigated by the risk sharing contract provision 
at december   our military health care payable was million 
any subsequent changes in an estimate for a prior year would be reflected in that subsequent year s operating results 
investment securities 
at december   we had total investments for continuing operations of million 
all of these investments are classified as available for sale and are presented at fair value 
except for restricted cash and investments  which totaled million at december   and are reported as non current assets  the remainder of these investments of million are available to support current operations and are therefore reported as current assets 
our discontinued operations had total investments of million of which million was classified as available for sale and the balance of million was classified as held to maturity 
held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost because we have the intent and ability to hold these investments until they mature 
unrealized investment gains and losses  net of related income taxes  on the available for sale investments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method and are included in investment and other revenues 
we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if there is an impairment that is other than temporary 
we must use our judgment in testing for impairment and we consider  among other factors  the length of time and the extent of a security s unrealized loss  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  economic forecasts and market or industry trends 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  a realized loss is recognized at the date of determination 
to date  we have not experienced any significant impairments that were other than temporary in our investments 
however  due to the current economic environment and the volatility of the securities market  testing for impairment has become more difficult and there is no assurance that future impairments may not be sustained  which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 
for example  if an other than temporary impairment occurred that reduced our total investments  including discontinued operations  by at december   our reported net income for the year would be reduced by million or and fully diluted earnings per share would be reduced by 
litigation and legal accruals 
we are subject to various claims and other litigation in the ordinary course of business 
such litigation includes  but is not limited to  claims of medical malpractice  claims for coverage or payment for medical services rendered to hmo members and claims by providers for payment for medical services rendered to hmo and other members 
we may also face claims for punitive damages that are not covered by insurance 
we are also subject to claims for workers compensation and claims by providers for payment for medical services rendered to injured workers 
with respect to certain pending actions  we maintain commercial insurance coverage with varying deductibles for which we maintain estimated reserves for our self insured portion based upon our current assessment of such litigation 
in addition  we accrue estimated legal defense and other settlement costs based on our assessment of the available information  including our outside legal counsel s assessment of the case 
we also assess potential legal exposure  based on currently available information  to determine if a precautionary notice of potential claim should be reported to our insurers and if an accrual should be established 
workers compensation loss and loss adjustment expenses 
discontinued operations workers compensation insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses  or lae  are based upon the accumulation of cost estimates for reported claims occurring during the period as well as an estimate for losses that have occurred but have not yet been reported 
similar to the health care medical expenses  we use a variety of standard actuarial projection methods to make these estimates and we must use our judgment in selecting development factors and assumed trends 
unlike health care medical expenses  where the cost to provide health care services is substantially completed within one year  workers compensation claims can be paid out over a substantial number of years due to certain lifetime benefits 
in addition  the period between when a claim is reported to us and when the injury occurred could be longer than one year and when we are no longer insuring the account 
loss and lae reserves have a significant degree of uncertainty when related to their subsequent payments 
although our reserves are established on the basis of a reasonable estimate  it is not only possible but also probable that our reserves will differ from their related subsequent developments 
underlying causes for this uncertainty include  but are not limited to  uncertainty in development patterns  unanticipated inflationary trends affecting the cost of services covered by the insurance contract  adverse legal outcomes and new interpretations of laws or regulations or of disputed contract provisions that result in our having to provide new or extended benefits 
this uncertainty can result in both adverse as well as favorable development of actual subsequent activity when compared to the reserve established 
during the past five years  we have had adverse development in our previously recorded loss and lae reserves that has ranged from a low of million to a high of million 
any subsequent change in loss and lae reserves established in a prior year would be reflected in that subsequent year s operating results 
management believes  based on information presently available  that the recorded liability for loss and lae reserves is reasonable and adequate to cover future workers compensation claim payments 
at december   loss and lae reserves represented of the liabilities of discontinued operations and of our total consolidated liabilities 
a change between the recorded liability and actual developed claim payments could have a material impact to our business and results of operations 
for example  a increase in loss and lae reserves  not covered by reinsurance  as of december   would reduce reported net income for the year by million or and diluted earnings per share would be reduced by reinsurance recoverable 
included in the assets of discontinued operations is reinsurance recoverable  which represents the estimated amount of unpaid workers compensation loss and lae reserves that would be recovered from our reinsurers and  to a lesser extent  amounts billed to the reinsurers for their portion of paid losses and lae 
reinsurance receivable for ceded paid claims is recorded in accordance with the terms of the agreements and reinsurance recoverable for unpaid losses and lae is estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsurance policy 
any significant changes in the underlying claim liability could directly affect the amount of reinsurance recoverable 
reinsurance recoverable  including amounts related to paid and unpaid losses  are reported as assets rather than a reduction of the related liabilities 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our obligations to enrollees  injured workers or policyholders 
if our reinsurers were to fail to honor their obligations because of insolvency  disputed contract provisions or for other reasons  we could incur significant losses 
prior to entering into reinsurance contracts  we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
in addition  we periodically monitor the financial strength of our reinsurers to determine if an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is warranted 
to date  we have never had to write off a workers compensation reinsurance recoverable balance and no allowance for uncollectible amounts has been established 
at december   reinsurance recoverable for workers compensation was million 
any subsequent change in reinsurance recoverable established in a prior year would be reflected in that subsequent year s operating results 
management believes  based on information presently available  that the recorded balance for reinsurance recoverables is reasonable and collectible 
a change between the recorded balance and the actual developed recoverable could have a material impact to our business and results of operations 
for example  a decrease in reinsurance recoverables as of december   would reduce reported net income for the year by million or and diluted earnings per share would be reduced by 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
our temporary differences arise principally from certain net operating losses  accrued expenses  reserves that are discounted for tax return purposes and depreciation 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of the existing temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is established for those portions of the deferred tax assets that we consider to be more likely than not unrealizable 
at december   our total deferred tax assets  including discontinued operations  were million and our total deferred tax liabilities were million 
management believes  based on information presently available  that the recorded deferred tax assets are reasonable and recoverable 
a change between the recorded asset and the subsequently used deferred tax asset could have a material impact to our business and results of operations 
for example  a decrease in the deferred tax asset as of december   could reduce reported net income for the year by  or and diluted earnings per share would be reduced by 
net proceeds from the sale of cal indemnity 
on november   we entered into an agreement to sell cal indemnity and its insurance subsidiaries 
the sale requires regulatory approval and is expected to be completed by april  the cash portion of the purchase price  which will be paid when the agreement becomes effective  is subject to certain adjustments that will not be determined until the transaction is consummated 
the value of certain assets will be subject to further adjustments at future dates 
the contingent payment portion of the purchase price will be based on the development that occurs on the loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserves from the consummation date through december  in addition  we will be obligated to perform  or be responsible for the performance of  certain transition services through december  for which we will receive a limited amount of funds for these services 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million  gross and net of tax  to write down the investment in cal indemnity to its estimated net sales proceeds of approximately million 
we did not recognize a tax benefit on the charge since our tax basis was less than our investment in cal indemnity 
we used estimates and assumptions to project cal indemnity s future operating results  the costs to perform transition services  the funds to be received for transition services  the expected value of certain assets  the development of loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserves  and the sales transaction costs 
prior to the effective date  any change to the net sales proceeds will be included in the results for discontinued operations 
after the effective date  any change to the net sales proceeds will be included in operating results of continuing operations 
a change to the net sales proceeds could have a material effect on our financial results 
for example  a decrease in the net sales proceeds as of december   would have reduced our reported net income for the year by  or and diluted earnings per share would be reduced by 
other 
in addition to the most critical accounting policies and estimates discussed above  other areas requiring us to use judgment  assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to  workers compensation earned but unbilled premiums  contractual discounts on professional fee revenue  allowances for doubtful receivables  other accrued liabilities  accrued payroll and taxes  post employment benefit liabilities  accrued policyholders dividends  unearned premium revenue and contingent assets and liabilities 
for a more extensive discussion of our accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk for the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of our investments 
we have not utilized derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
as of december   including discontinued operations  we have approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and current  long term and restricted investments 
of the total investments of million  approximately million are classified as available for sale and million are classified as held to maturity 
these investments are primarily in fixed income investment grade securities 
our investment policy emphasizes return of principal and liquidity and is focused on fixed returns that limit volatility and risk of principal 
because of our investment policies  the primary market risk associated with our portfolio is interest rate risk 
assuming interest rates were to increase by a factor of  the net hypothetical loss in fair value of stockholders equity related to financial instruments is estimated to be approximately million after tax of total stockholders equity 
of the million decrease  million is related to our discontinued operations 
we believe that such an increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows  as it is unlikely that we would need or choose to substantially liquidate our investment portfolio 
the effect of interest rate risk on potential near term net income  cash flow and fair value was determined based on commonly used interest rate sensitivity analyses 
the models project the impact of interest rate changes on a wide range of factors  including duration and prepayment 
fair value was estimated based on the net present value of cash flows or duration estimates  assuming an immediate increase in interest rates 
because duration is estimated  rather than a known quantity  for certain securities  other market factors may impact security valuations and there can be no assurance that our portfolio would perform in line with the estimated values
