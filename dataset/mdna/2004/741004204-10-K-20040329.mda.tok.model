item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview presidential realty corporation is taxed for federal income tax purposes as a real estate investment trust and owns real estate and makes loans secured by interests in real estate 
real estate loans during  the company made two new loans in the aggregate principal amount of  which loans are secured by the ownership interests in entities that own real property 
management believes that under current market conditions it can obtain better returns from these types of investments  which have current interest rates ranging from to per annum  than the returns available from the ownership and operation of real estate 
in addition  in  in order to deter some borrowers from prepaying loans that were outstanding at favorable interest rates  the company modified three loans  which modifications  while slightly reducing the interest rates on the notes  extended the maturity dates and restricted prepayment for additional periods 
in addition  the company received repayments of  on its loan portfolio 
rental property operations the company s income from rental property operations was adversely affected during as a result of increasing vacancy losses and expenses at its farrington apartments property 
in an effort to improve vacancy levels at this property  the company has offered reduced rents and rental concessions 
discontinued operations in  the company contracted to sell its continental gardens property for a sales price of  and the sale is expected to close in the second or third quarter of the company estimates the net cash proceeds of sale to be approximately  and expects to utilize all or a portion of the proceeds to purchase other properties and treat the sale and purchase as a tax free exchange to the extent necessary to defer taxes on the sale 
as a result of the poor performance of the company s preston lake apartments property  the company decided in the third quarter of  to sell that property and has classified the property as a discontinued operation 
as a result of this decision to sell the property  the company was required to record the asset at the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less costs to sell 
therefore  the company recorded a  impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 
critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures 
these estimates require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
management has discussed with the company s audit committee the implementation of the critical accounting policies described below and the estimates required with respect thereto 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
additions and improvements are capitalized and repairs and maintenance are charged to rental property operating expenses as incurred 
depreciation is generally provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
the useful life of each property  as well as the allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components  requires estimates by management 
if management incorrectly estimates the allocation of those costs or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
the company reviews each of its properties  including the property held by pdl  inc and associates limited co partnership home mortgage partnership  for impairment at least annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances warrant 
if impairment were to occur  the property would be written down to its estimated fair value 
the company assesses impairment based on undiscounted cash flow estimates that utilize appropriate capitalization rates 
the future estimated cash flows of a property are based on current rental revenues and operating expenses  as well as the current local economic climate of the property 
considerable judgment is required in making these estimates and changes in these estimates could cause the estimated cash flows to change and impairment could occur 
as of december   the company s net real estate was  and the home mortgage partnership s net real estate was  no impairments have been recorded on any of these properties exclusive of assets included in discontinued operations 
assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations assets related to discontinued operations are carried at the lower of cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization or fair value less costs to sell 
an operating property is classified as held for sale and  accordingly  as a discontinued operation when  in the judgment of management  a sale that will close within one year is probable 
the company discontinues depreciation and amortization when a property is classified as a discontinued operation 
at december   assets related to discontinued operations were  after an impairment charge of  which reduced the carrying value of a property held for sale to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the amount ultimately realized upon disposition of that property could vary materially from this estimate 
liabilities related to assets held for sale consist primarily of the  nonrecourse mortgage debt on the properties  which will either be assumed by the purchaser or repaid from the proceeds of the sale 
at december   total liabilities related to discontinued operations were  see discontinued operations below 
mortgage portfolio the company evaluates the collectibility of both accrued interest and principal on its  mortgage portfolio to determine whether there are any impaired loans 
if a mortgage loan were considered to be impaired  the company would establish a valuation allowance equal to the difference between a the carrying value of the loan  and b the present value of the expected cash flows from the loan at its effective interest rate  or at the estimated fair value of the real estate collateralizing the loan 
although  a loan modification could be an indicator of a possible impairment  the company has in the past  and may in the future  modify loans for business purposes and not as a result of debtor financial difficulties 
income on impaired loans is recognized only as cash is received 
all loans are current as to payment of principal and interest according to their terms  as modified  and no loans have been classified as impaired 
allowance for doubtful accounts management assesses the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and other receivables  using indicators such as past due accounts  the nature and age of the receivable  the payment history and the ability of the tenant or debtor to meet its payment obligations 
management s estimate of allowances for doubtful accounts is subject to revision as these factors change 
rental revenue is recorded on the accrual method and rental revenue recognition is generally discontinued when the tenant in occupancy is delinquent for ninety days or more and bad debt expense is charged for vacated tenant accounts 
at december   other receivables  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  were  for the year ended december   bad debt expense all of which was for tenant obligations was  less than of total rental revenues

the accumulated benefit obligation at december  was  and the fair value of the plan assets was  at december  and  the discount rate used in computing the accumulated benefit obligation was and  respectively 
the expected rate of return on plan assets was for both years 
management regularly reviews the plan assets  the actuarial assumptions and the expected rate of return 
changes in actuarial assumptions  interest rates or changes in the fair value of the plan assets can materially affect the benefit obligation  the required funding and the benefit costs 
in addition  the company has contractual retirement agreements with certain active and retired officers providing for unfunded pension benefits 
the company accrues on an actuarial basis the estimated costs of these benefits during the years the employee provides services 
the benefits generally provide for annual payments in specified amounts for each participant for life  commencing upon retirement  with an annual cost of living increase 
pursuant to a january  amendment  the benefit commencement date for three active officers was changed to four years after they actually retire 
benefits paid for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively

the accumulated contractual pension benefit obligation at december  was  at december  and  the discount rate used in computing the accumulated benefit obligation was and  respectively 
changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions  amendments to the plan and life expectancies could materially affect benefit costs and the contractual accumulated pension benefit obligation 
income taxes the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit under sections of the code 
under those sections  a reit which meets certain requirements is not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders  if at least of its reit taxable income exclusive of capital gains is so distributed 
the company has distributed of its reit taxable income exclusive of capital gains for the year and expects to distribute all of its remaining taxable income during and  accordingly  has made no provision for income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments consist primarily of mortgage notes receivable and mortgage notes payable 
substantially all of these instruments bear interest at fixed rates  so the company s cash flows from them are not directly impacted by changes in market rates of interest 
changes in market rates of interest impact the fair values of these fixed rate assets and liabilities 
however  because the company generally holds its notes receivable until maturity and repays its notes payable at maturity or upon sale of the related properties  any fluctuations in values do not impact the company s earnings  balance sheet or cash flows 
however  since some of the company s mortgage notes payable are at fixed rates of interest and provide for yield maintenance payments upon prepayment prior to maturity  if market interest rates are lower than the interest rates on the mortgage notes payable  the company s ability to sell the properties securing the notes may be adversely affected and the net proceeds of any sale may be reduced because of the yield maintenance requirements 
the company does not own any derivative financial instruments or engage in hedging activities
