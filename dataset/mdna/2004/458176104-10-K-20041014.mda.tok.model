management s discussion and analysis includes business overview 
a discussion of estimates and assumptions affecting the application of our critical accounting policies 
a comparison of our results of operations for fiscal with the results for fiscal  and the results for fiscal with those for fiscal recently issued accounting pronouncements 
a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources 
business overview we develop  market and support desktop  enterprise and carrier class synchronization software that enable consumers  business professionals and it professionals to extend the capabilities of wireless or wireline personal communications platforms 
our products are designed to improve the productivity of business professionals who require access to essential  current information  anytime and anywhere 
we have organized our operations into a single operating segment encompassing the development  marketing and support of software and services that provide synchronization  wireless email  mobile application development  application device management  real time remote information access  secure vpn  and identity searching matching screening capabilities 
we license our software products directly to corporations  wireless carriers  original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and business development organizations worldwide 
in addition  we sell our retail products through several distribution channels both in the united states and internationally  including major distributors  resellers  computer dealers  retailers and mail order companies 
internationally  we are represented by over distributors  resellers and retailers in north america  europe  the asia pacific region  south america and africa 
one component of our business strategy is to enhance stockholder value through the acquisition of companies and technologies that we can leverage to improve our strategic market position and growth potential in both emerging and established technologies 
our recent acquisitions  together with our internal development efforts  have been aimed at expanding our focus from cabled synchronization to synchronization for wireless handhelds  smartphones  laptops and tablets  where a number of industry analysts  such as international data corporation  or idc  predict future growth 
we expect the acquisition of spontaneous technology  inc  synchrologic  inc 
and search software america pty 
ltd  as well as transfer of employees from softvision srl  along with the efforts of our management and employee  to aid in our growth and development  including in the wireless carrier markets 
for details on the acquisitions  refer to the discussion under the caption acquisitions set forth under liquidity and capital resources below 
we intend to capitalize on the continued growth in demand for wireless services and the related infrastructure required  including hosting  application and other related services  to support that growth 
as such  maintaining and cultivating relationships with wireless carriers is currently one of the critical focus areas of our research and development and sales and marketing groups 
we believe that wireless services will continue to be one of the fastest growing segments of the telecommunications industry and that wireless carriers will be under increasing competitive pressure 
as a result  we believe there will be significant opportunities to provide wireless carriers with services that enable them to focus internal resources on their core business activities while increasing revenues  improving service quality and reducing costs 
we also plan to continue working on achieving operational and cost efficiencies 
our restructuring program during the third quarter of fiscal reflects our ongoing efforts to better align our costs structure with revenue performance 
we expect to continue to implement our business development strategy in fiscal to increase market share  we may also attempt to acquire or seek alliances with key competitors and other companies that may have important products and synergies with our existing operations and products 
convertible senior notes to implement our business strategy  we fund our acquisitions  research and development and general working capital primarily through cash flow from operations and recently through debt issuance 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the offering of  of convertible senior notes to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on rule a under the securities act 
proceeds of approximately  net of the initial purchasers discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs  were received from the offering in march a portion of the net proceeds of the offering were used to complete the acquisition of ssa 
we intend to use the balance of the net proceeds to fund possible investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies or establishing joint ventures and for general corporate purposes and working capital requirements 
we invested the net proceeds from this offering  pending their ultimate use  in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
for further details on the convertible senior notes  as well as the interest rate swaps we entered into in conjunction with the notes  refer to the discussion under the caption convertible senior notes and interest rate swaps set forth under liquidity and capital resources below 
estimates  assumptions and critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth in part iv of this annual report on form k 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions  which we review with our audit committee 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon various factors and information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these factors and information may include  but are not limited to  history and prior experience  experience of other enterprises in the same industry  new related events  current economic conditions and information from third party professionals 
the estimates  judgments and assumptions we make can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we use estimates in accounting for  among other things  various revenue contracts  returns  recoverability of long lived assets and investments  in process research and development  restructuring accruals  contingencies  allowances for uncollectible receivables  and depreciation and amortization 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following license and services revenue recognition 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation or integration exist  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
arrangements for which the fees are not deemed probable for collection are recognized upon cash collection 
if we were to assess the collectibility of fees differently  the timing and amount of our revenue recognition might differ substantially from previously estimated or reported 
services revenue primarily comprises revenue from consulting fees  maintenance contracts and training 
services revenue from consulting and training is recognized as the service is performed 
maintenance contracts include the right to unspecified upgrades and ongoing support 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably as services are provided over the maintenance period 
if we were to allocate more or less value to the unspecified upgrades and ongoing support  the timing of our revenue recognition might differ substantially from that previously reported 
for contracts with multiple elements  and for which vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements exists  revenue is recognized for the delivered elements based upon the residual contract value as prescribed by the american institute of certified public accountants in statement of position sop no 
we have accumulated relevant information from contracts to use in determining the availability of vendor specific objective evidence and believe that such information complies with the criteria established in sop no 
 software revenue recognition which provides guidance on generally accepted accounting principles for recognizing revenue on software transactions 
if we were to allocate the respective fair values of the aforementioned elements differently  the timing of our revenue recognition might differ substantially from that previously estimated or reported 
license and services revenue associated with contracts that involve significant implementation of customization of services  which are essential to the functionality of the software  is recognized over the period of each engagement  primarily using the percentage of completion method 
labor hours incurred is generally used as the measure of progress towards completion as prescribed by sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain product type contracts 
revenue for these arrangements is classified as license revenue and services revenue based upon estimates of fair value of each element  and the revenue is recognized based on the percentage of completion ratio for the arrangement 
recognized revenue is subject to revisions as the engagement progresses to completion 
revisions in estimates or estimated losses on engagements are made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
considerable judgment  such as the scope of work and reliance on the customer or other vendors to fulfill some tasks  may be required in determining estimates to complete an engagement 
if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates of the total amount of work required to complete the engagement  the timing of our revenue recognition from period to period  as well as the related margins  might differ substantially from that previously estimated or reported 
we consider a project completed at the go live date 
when we sell additional licenses  we recognize revenue after the go live date if the products or seats have been delivered and no remaining obligations exist 
we license rights to use our intellectual property portfolio  whereby licensees  particularly oems  typically pay a non refundable license fee in one or more installments and on going royalties based on their sales of products incorporating our intellectual property 
revenue from oems under minimum guaranteed royalty arrangements  which are not subject to future obligations  is recognized when such royalties are earned and become payable 
royalty revenue is recognized as earned when reasonable estimates of such amounts can be made 
royalty revenue that is subject to future obligations is recognized when such obligations are fulfilled 
royalty revenue that exceeds minimum guarantees is recognized in the period earned 
if we were to assess the collectibility of royalties differently or make different judgments or utilize different estimates  the timing and amount of our revenue recognition might differ substantially from previously estimated or reported 
channel inventory and product returns 
the primary sales channel into which we sell our retail products is a network of distributors and value added resellers in north america  europe  asia pacific  south america and africa 
agreements with our distributors and resellers contain specific product return privileges for stock rotation and obsolete products that are generally limited to contractual amounts 
reserves for estimated future returns are provided for upon revenue recognition 
product returns are recorded as a reduction of revenues 
accordingly  we have established a product returns reserve composed of of product inventories held at our distribution partners  as well as an estimated amount for returns from customers of our distributors and other resellers as a result of stock rotation and obsolete products  among others 
we evaluate our product returns reserve on a quarterly basis 
in estimating our product returns reserve  we evaluate the following factors our demand forecast by product in each of our principal geographic markets  which is affected by our product release schedule  seasonal trends  and analyses developed by our internal sales and marketing group  historical product returns and inventory levels on a product by product basis  current inventory levels and sell through data on a product by product basis as reported to us by our major distributors worldwide on a monthly basis  risk associated with recognizing revenue on individual customers  based on facts and circumstances  and general economic conditions 
in general  we would expect product returns to increase following the announcement of new or upgraded versions of our products or in anticipation of such product announcements  as our distributors and resellers seek to reduce their inventory levels of the prior version of a product in advance of receiving the new version 
similarly  we would expect that product inventory held by our distributors and resellers would increase following the successful introduction of new or upgraded products  as these resellers stock the new version in anticipation of demand 
in assessing the appropriateness of product inventory levels held by our resellers and the impact on potential product returns  we may limit sales to our distributors and resellers in order to maintain inventory levels deemed by management to be appropriate 
we generally estimate and provide product returns reserve based on anticipated level of returns and the criteria noted above 
accordingly  actual product returns may differ from our estimates and may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and consolidated results of operations in future periods due to factors including  but not limited to  market conditions and product release cycles 
provision for doubtful accounts 
our provision for doubtful accounts relates to customer accounts receivable 
the provision for doubtful accounts is an estimate prepared by management based on identification of the collectibility of specific accounts and the overall condition of the receivable portfolios 
we specifically analyze customer receivables  as well as analyze the aging of our accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credits  customer concentrations  the financial condition of the customers and their credit worthiness  changes in payment terms  current economic trends  our historical write off experience and other assumptions  when evaluating the adequacy of the provision for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize more of our receivables in the future than previously estimated  an adjustment to the allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the provision for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are recorded as deemed necessary 
valuation of goodwill  other intangibles  investments and other long lived assets 
we have accumulated over the years a significant amount of goodwill  other intangible assets  long term and other long lived assets as a result of our investments and acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired an is tested for impairment at least annually and written down only when impaired 
identifiable intangible assets result from the application of the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions 
our identifiable intangible assets as of july   were composed of our unamortized developed and core technology  patents  trademark  customer base  covenant not to compete  customer contracts and acquired workforce not accounted as a business combination 
developed and core technology  patents and customer base are amortized over the period of benefit  generally four to years 
trademarks are amortized over the period of benefit of three years 
covenants not to compete  customer contracts and acquired workforce are amortized over the period of benefit  ranging from nine months to two years 
the ongoing evaluation for impairment of certain identifiable intangibles  investments and long lived assets requires significant management estimation and judgment 
we evaluate the carrying value of these assets for impairment  when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable as defined in the respective literature 
in addition  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to test goodwill annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
intangible assets with indefinite lives will be tested for impairment using a one step process that compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset 
changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  changes in overall business strategy  negative industry or economic trends  and decline in stock price and market capitalization may trigger an impairment review for certain intangibles 
poor operating results of underlying investments or adverse changes in market conditions may result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of investments 
changes in market value of the assets  physical changes and continuing operating or cash flow losses associated with assets used to generate revenue may suggest problems of recoverability for certain long lived assets 
whenever the evaluation demonstrates that the carrying amount of an intangible  investment or any other long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment charge may be required 
as of july   our goodwill amounted to  the annual impairment review for goodwill was completed on july   and did not identify any impairment 
as of july   other intangibles amounted to  net of accumulated amortization 
we expect to amortize approximately     and  of our other intangibles in fiscal    and thereafter  respectively  based on our acquisitions completed as of july  to the extent we do not generate sufficient cash flows to recover the net amount of our investment in goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets recorded  the investment could be considered impaired and subject to earlier write off 
in process research and development 
we value tangible and intangible assets acquired through our business acquisitions  including in process research and development  or ipr d  at fair value 
we determine ipr d through established valuation techniques for various projects for the development of new products and technologies and expenses ipr d when technical feasibility is not reached 
the value of ipr d is determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 
each project is analyzed and estimates and judgments are made to determine the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of completion 
during fiscal  and  we expensed approximately   and zero  respectively  in ipr d charges primarily related to the various acquisitions we had because the technological feasibility of certain products under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
if we acquire other companies with ipr d in the future  we will value the ipr d through established valuation techniques and will incur future ipr d charges if those products under development have not reached technical feasibility 
restructuring accruals 
in recent years  we implemented several cost reduction plans as part of our continued effort to streamline our operations to properly size ongoing operating expenses 
these plans resulted in restructuring charges related to  among others  the consolidation of excess facilities 
these charges relate to facilities and portions of facilities we no longer utilize and either seek to terminate early or sublease 
lease termination costs for the abandoned facilities were estimated for the remaining lease obligations and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees and sublease rates which can be achieved using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage retained by us 
each reporting period we review these estimates and to the extent that these assumptions change due to continued negotiations with landlords or changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary by material amounts 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to estimate reasonably the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred on the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for such matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss  our results of operations may be overstated or understated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
results of operations the following table sets forth items included in the consolidated statements of operations part iv of this annual report on form k as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated 
years ended july  revenue license services total revenue cost of revenue cost of license revenue cost of services revenue amortization of developed and core technology total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative in process research and development amortization of goodwill amortization of other intangible assets restructuring and other charges impairment of assets total operating expenses operating loss other income expense interest income interest expense litigation settlement gain  net other  net other than temporary impairment of investments total other income expense loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss fiscal year ended july  as compared to fiscal year ended july  revenue year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage total revenue we derive revenue from two primary sources software licenses and fees for services 
our fourth quarter of fiscal reflected our seventh consecutive quarter of increase in revenue  primarily due from revenue contributions of intellisync mobile suite  professional service and ssa products and technology  reflected in the growth in the number of our technology licensing partners 
these increases are largely the result of our recent acquisitions and  we believe  of increase in sales and marketing efforts  both domestically and internationally  and our emphasis on enhancing our product offerings 
during the second half of fiscal  our intellisync mobile suite  intellisync handheld edition  and intellisync phone edition platforms have each added support for many new wireless devices or smartphones  the market for which we believe has experienced growth recently 
we plan to continue to add wireless device support to our wide array of supported wired devices 
while the market for smartphones and other wireless mobile devices has been growing recently  the market for wired or traditional personal digital assistants  or pdas  has continued to face challenges 
the overall decline in traditional pda sales has had a direct impact on sales of our intellisync products through the consumer and online channels  where sales of our synchronization software typically occur at the same time a pda is purchased  or shortly thereafter 
due to this decline  our retail revenue has not increased as we would have liked during fiscal as we look ahead to fiscal  we are planning for further sequential growth in our quarterly revenue made possible by our new enterprise and technology licensing partners and further contributions from intellisync mobile suite and identity system products 
our acquisitions of synchrologic and ssa have strengthened and  we expect  to continue to strengthen our presence in europe and asia pacific 
our acquisition of starfish and asset purchase of loudfire in fiscal  as well as our recent acquisitions of spontaneous technology  synchrologic and ssa in fiscal have provided and are expected to further provide us with access to new technology capabilities  potential access to new markets and customers and other revenue generation opportunities 
we expect revenue benefits over time through synergies in technology  product development and operations 
our recent acquisitions already have made positive contributions to revenue for fiscal we believe that new and existing products based upon the technologies from starfish  spontaneous technology  synchrologic and ssa will continue to have a positive impact on revenues  provide operational benefits and improve our bottom line in fiscal license revenue year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage license revenue as percentage of total revenue license revenue is earned from the sale and use of software products including our technology licensing components and royalty agreements with oems 
the increase in absolute license revenue for fiscal as compared with that for fiscal reflected an increase of  in revenue from technology licensing components and an increase of  in revenue from enterprise 
a significant portion of the increase in our license revenue for fiscal was contributed by synchrologic and ssa 
the increase in license revenue was also due to greater demand  as compared with the preceding fiscal year  for certain of our customers products in which our technology is embedded 
the increase in our customers sales provided us with increased royalty proceeds 
as a percentage of total revenue  license revenue decreased due to significant increase in our revenue from professional services as described below  as well as the general impact of the decline in wired or traditional pda sales to our retail revenue 
services revenue year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage services revenue as percentage of total revenue services revenue is derived from fees for services  including fixed price and time and materials professional services arrangements and amortization of maintenance contract programs 
the increase in services revenue for fiscal as compared with that for fiscal resulted from an increase of  in professional service revenue associated with our technology licensing partners 
the increase in professional service revenue was attributable to new customer contracts primarily associated with our recent acquisitions and increased sales effort 
the increase in services revenue was also due to approximately  increase in amortization of our maintenance contract programs relating to increase in license revenue and a greater focus on renewals 
in any period  services revenue from time and materials contracts is dependent  among other things  on license transactions closed during the current and preceding quarters and customer decisions regarding implementations of licensed software 
enterprise and retail products year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage enterprise and retail products revenue as percentage of total revenue our enterprise and retail products revenue includes sales to retail distribution channels  as well as direct sales of our personal and server products licensed to corporations for internal use 
enterprise and retail products include intellisync handheld edition  intellisync handheld edition for enterprise formerly enterprise intellisync  intellisync phone edition  intellisync mobile suite formerly synchrologic mobile suite  and ssa s identity systems  as well as related support and maintenance 
enterprise sales frequently involve large up front license fees  which can result in lengthy sales cycles and uncertainties as to the timing of sales driven by customers budgetary processes 
as a result  we generally have less visibility into future enterprise sales than is typically the case in our royalty based technology licensing business 
in addition  while enterprise sales generally result in ongoing maintenance revenues and may lead to follow on purchases or upgrades  we are typically dependent on sales to new customers for the significant portion of our enterprise revenues in a given quarter 
the increase in enterprise and retail products revenue for fiscal resulted from contributions of  from ssa and synchrologic products  an increase of  in revenue from amortization of support and maintenance  and an increase of  in retail sales of our intellisync software 
this increase for fiscal was slightly offset by a  decrease in revenue from intellisync handheld edition for enterprise 
less emphasis on marketing of intellisync handheld edition for enterprise and intellisync mobileapp designer  and more on the transition of our enterprise server offering to intellisync mobile suite  during fiscal contributed to the decrease in revenue from intellisync handheld edition for enterprise and intellisync mobileapp designer 
we expect revenue in absolute dollars from enterprise and retail products  particularly enterprise  to further improve in the following few quarters which we believe will be driven by contributions from intellisync mobile suite acquired from synchrologic and identity systems acquired from ssa 
in addition  we expect revenue from this support for wireless devices to offset the impact of the lower wired or traditional pda sales on our retail revenue which would otherwise decline 
technology licensing components year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage technology licensing components revenue as percentage of total revenue technology licensing components include various licensed technology platforms  including intellisync software development platform  intellisync for the web  intellisync syncml server formerly truesync  intellisync server to server  professional services  non recurring engineering services and related maintenance contract programs 
the increase in technology licensing revenue for fiscal as compared with that for fiscal resulted from an increase of  in intellisync software development platform revenue  an increase of  in professional services and hosting services revenue 
the decrease in technology licensing revenue for fiscal as a percentage of revenue was due to a larger increase in revenue from enterprise and retail products 
we expect revenue from technology licensing components for the first quarter of fiscal to equal or exceed levels reached in the most recent quarters of fiscal international revenue year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage international revenue as percentage of total revenue international revenue continues to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
the year over year increase in our international revenues accounted for of our total revenue increase for fiscal the increase in our professional services revenue and the number of our international technology licensing partners  particularly in japan  resulted in an increase in our international revenue in absolute dollars during fiscal the slight decrease in international revenue as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal  on the other hand  is primarily due to increased revenue from our newer offerings in the united states 
we expect our recent acquisitions of synchrologic and ssa will further strengthen our presence in asia pacific  as well as europe 
we believe  however  that international revenue will fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis as we periodically enter into new agreements for professional services and new international partner contracts for technology licensing 
international revenue may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in operations in the united states  including exposure to tariffs  various trade regulations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  as well as international software piracy as described more fully in risk factors set forth above 
we believe that continued growth would require further expansion in international markets 
we have utilized  and may continue to utilize substantial resources both to expand and establish international operations in the future 
top customers no customers accounted for more than of our total revenue for fiscal products sold through ingram micro us  a distributor  accounted for less than of our total revenue for fiscal and of our total revenue for fiscal no other customers accounted for more than of total revenue during fiscal cost of revenue year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage total cost of revenue as percentage of total revenue cost of revenue consists of license costs  service costs and the amortization of developed and core technology 
license costs comprise product packaging expenses such as product media and duplication  manuals  packing supplies  and shipping costs 
service costs comprise personnel related expenses such as salaries and other related costs associated with work performed under professional service contracts  non recurring engineering agreements  post sales customer support costs and hosting costs for hosting services associated with technology licensing partners and end users 
hosting costs include expenses related to bandwidth for hosting  tape backup  security and storage  third party fees and internal personnel costs associated with logistics and operational support of the hosting services 
service costs can be expected to vary significantly from period to period depending on the mix of services we provide 
in general  license revenue costs represent a smaller percentage of license revenue when compared with services revenue costs as a percentage of services revenue  this is due to the high cost structure of services revenue 
additionally  license costs tend to be variable based on license revenue volumes  whereas service costs tend to be fixed within certain services revenue volume ranges 
we would expect that an increase in services revenue as a percentage of our total revenue would generate lower overall gross margins as a percentage of total revenue 
also  given the high level of fixed costs associated with the professional services group and our hosting operations  our inability to generate revenue sufficient to absorb these fixed costs could lead to low or negative service gross margins 
cost of license revenue year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage cost of license revenue as percentage of license revenue the increase in cost of license revenue in fiscal resulted from the increase in overall revenue from enterprise and retail products  much of which was brought about by the assimilation of products from our newly acquired subsidiaries 
the cost of cables associated with our intellisync phone edition product also contributed to an increase in our cost of license revenue 
cost of services revenue year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage cost of services revenue as percentage of services revenue the increase in cost of services revenue in absolute dollars reflected the increase in professional services costs as a result of the starfish acquisition in the second half of fiscal and spontaneous technology  synchrologic and ssa in the first three quarters of fiscal the decrease in cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue was due to low cost maintenance contracts acquired as part of our acquisitions particularly of ssa 
we expect our cost of revenue  exclusive of stock compensation charges and amortization of purchased technology  in the next quarter to increase slightly relative to that of the fourth quarter of fiscal due in part to the impact of further increase in our total revenue and additional costs in support of our hosting revenue 
in future periods  cost of revenue may further fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to potential changes in the infrastructure and other requirements of our hosting operations to meet carriers demand 
these changes  which may be costly  are difficult to forecast 
in addition  our cost of revenue is primarily driven by our expectation for different margin characteristics within and between license and services revenues as well as the expected mix between products and channels 
amortization of developed and core technology year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage amortization of developed and core technology as percentage of total revenue developed and core technology amounted to  and  net of accumulated amortization  as of july  and  respectively 
we continue to amortize other intangible assets  review such assets for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  reassess their useful lives and make any necessary adjustments 
amortization of purchased technology is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  generally four to seven years 
the increase in the amortization of developed and core technology for fiscal was primarily due to the impact of recently developed and core technology from starfish  loudfire  spontaneous technology  synchrologic and ssa 
based on acquisitions completed as of july   we expect the future amortization expense of developed and core technology is as follows in thousands fiscal year ending july  thereafter we expect that we may acquire additional developed and core technology in connection with any acquisitions we may complete in the future 
as a result  we may further increase our amortization expense of developed and core technology 
research and development year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage research and development as percentage of total revenue research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for research and development personnel  quality assurance personnel  product localization  fees to outside contractors and the cost of facilities and depreciation of capital equipment 
we invest in research and development both for new products and to provide continuing enhancements to existing products 
our engineering group is currently aiming their efforts at expanding focus from cabled synchronization to synchronization for wireless handhelds  smartphones  laptops and tablets  at extending our core synchronization technology to increase scalability and extensibility  and at supporting next generation wireless technology and device platforms 
the increase in research and development spending in absolute dollars was due to acquired workforce of approximately engineers from the acquisition of spontaneous technology  synchrologic and ssa during the first three quarters of fiscal the decrease in research and development spending as a percentage of revenue for fiscal resulted from an increase in our total revenue 
sales and marketing year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage sales and marketing as percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  promotional expenses and other costs relating to sales and marketing employees  as well as to technical support personnel associated with pre sales activities such as building brand awareness  performing product and technical presentations and answering customers product and service inquiries 
sales and marketing expenses increased year over year in absolute dollars as a result of establishing strategic relationships with our existing and prospective enterprise customers  as well as increase in sales commissions and increase in marketing program spending to support increased revenue activities driven by our recent acquisitions 
we have also acquired new sales and marketing employees from synchrologic during the second quarter of fiscal and from ssa 
sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue due to an increase in our total revenue 
we intend to increase awareness and market presence of our existing and new products  services or technology over time  which may require us to substantially increase the amount we spend on sales and marketing in future periods 
we expect that these expenses will continue to increase as we grow 
general and administrative year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage general and administrative as percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other costs relating to administrative  executive and financial personnel and outside professional fees 
the major factors for the increase in general and administrative spending in absolute dollars for fiscal include an increase of  in outside services brought about primarily by legal costs associated with our patent infringement lawsuits and an increase in accounting costs 
also a major factor for an increase in general and administrative expenses was personnel related costs of  as a result primarily of recent acquisitions of synchrologic and ssa 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue due to an increase in our total revenue 
depending on the degree of the fluctuation of our stock price in the future  we may incur a significant variable accounting charge or a recovery of charges from prior quarters associated with certain employee stock options 
the charge or the recovery may increase or decrease our total general and administrative costs in the next few quarters 
the charge or the recovery may also further increase or offset our expected total cost of revenue  research and development and sales and marketing costs in the near future 
in process research and development year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage in process research and development as percentage of total revenue the purchase price of each of our recent acquisitions spontaneous technology  synchrologic  and ssa was assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired  including the in process research and development 
as of the respective acquisition date  technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been established and the technology had no alternative future use 
accordingly  we expensed the in process research and development of   and  at the date of the acquisition of spontaneous technology  synchrologic and ssa  respectively 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to in process research and technology was based on established valuation techniques used in the high technology software industry 
the fair value assigned to the acquired in process research and development was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the key assumptions used in the valuation include  among others  expected completion date of the in process projects identified as of the acquisition date  estimated costs to complete the projects  revenue contributions and expense projections assuming the resulting product has entered the market  and discount rate based on the risks associated with the development life cycle of the in process technology acquired 
the discount rate used in the present value calculations is normally obtained from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted upward to account for the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in process research and development  the expected profitability levels of such technology  and the uncertainty of technological advances that could potentially impact the estimates 
we assume the pricing model for the resulting product of the acquired in process research and technology to be standard within its industry 
we  however  did not take into consideration any consequential amount of expense reductions from integrating the acquired in process technology with other existing in process or completed technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include significant anticipated cost savings 
the key assumptions underlying the valuation of acquired in process research and development from are as follows in thousands spontaneous technology project names version upgrade of spontaneous technology s secure virtual private network  or svpn percent completed as of acquisition date estimated costs to complete technology at acquisition date  risk adjusted discount rate first period expected revenue calendar year synchrologic project names version upgrade of data sync  file sync  e mail accelerator and systems management products percent completed as of acquisition date estimated costs to complete technology at acquisition date  risk adjusted discount rate first period expected revenue calendar year search software america project names ssa name version and ids version percent completed as of acquisition date estimated costs to complete technology at acquisition date  risk adjusted discount rate first period expected revenue june the development of above technology remains highly dependent on the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for a new product  and significant competitive threats from several companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop this technology into a commercially viable product consists primarily of planning  designing  experimenting  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technology can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring the product to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets  and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
subsequent to the acquisition of spontaneous technology  synchrologic  and ssa  there have been no significant developments related to the current status of the acquired in process research and development projects that would result in material changes to the assumptions 
in the third quarter of fiscal we recorded a charge of  for in process research and development associated with the acquisition of starfish 
for details on starfish in process research and development charge  refer to the discussion under the caption fiscal year ended july  as compared to fiscal year ended july  set forth below 
if all the above in process research and development projects are not successfully developed  our future revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisitions were completed and may result in impairment charges 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
amortization of other intangible assets year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage amortization of other intangible assets as percentage of total revenue other intangible assets  excluding developed and core technology  amounted to  and  net of accumulated amortization  as of july  and  respectively 
we continue to amortize other intangible assets  review such assets for impairment under sfas no 
 reassess their useful lives and make any necessary adjustments 
amortization of other intangible assets is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  generally nine months to seven years 
the increase in the amortization of other intangible assets in fiscal was primarily due to the impact of recently acquired intangibles from starfish  loudfire  spontaneous technology  synchrologic and ssa 
based on acquisitions completed as of july   we expect the future amortization expense of other intangible assets is as follows in thousands fiscal year ending july  thereafter we expect that we may acquire additional intangible assets associated with any acquisitions we may complete in the future 
as a result  we may further increase our amortization expense of other intangible assets 
restructuring and other charges year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage restructuring charges severance costs facilities costs restructuring charges other charges costs relating to a ceased acquisition restructuring and other charges as percentage of total revenue restructuring charges and accrual 
during fiscal and  we implemented a number of cost reduction plans aimed at reducing costs that were not integral to our overall strategy and better aligning our expense levels with current revenue levels 
these initiatives included a reduction in workforce and facilities consolidation 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we implemented a reduction in workforce affecting employees in various business functions nine in research and development and eight in sales and marketing 
the program was completed by the end of april  and the associated severance costs incurred were approximately  none of which remained unused as of july  during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of vacating our remaining office space in santa cruz  california and the difficulties in subletting such facility because of the continuing deterioration of the real estate market in this location  we determined that additional charges were needed for adjustments in our expected future sublease rates and brokerage fees 
we therefore recorded total facilities costs of  inclusive of the costs of  for vacating a floor of our office facility in san jose  california 
in fiscal  we incurred approximately  for severance and separation costs relating to recent termination of of our engineering and product management employees 
we also incurred a charge of approximately  for a revised estimated lease exit cost due to additional time required to sublease the facilities 
this revision was attributable to the high vacancy rates in the corporate real estate market in northern california 
inherent in the estimation of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
in determining the excess facilities exit costs  we were required to estimate future sublease income  negotiated lease settlement costs  future net operating expenses of the facilities  and brokerage commissions  among other expenses 
these estimates  along with other estimates made by management in connection with restructuring  may vary significantly depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control 
specifically  these estimates will depend on our success in negotiating with lessors  the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
adjustments to the reserve for the consolidation of excess facilities will be required if actual lease exit costs or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected 
the following table sets forth the activities in the restructuring accrual account for the periods presented in thousands workforce reduction consolidation of excess facilities total balance at july  restructuring provision adjustment cash payments balance at july  restructuring provision adjustment cash payments balance at july  the remaining unpaid amount as of july  of  related to the net lease expense due to the consolidation of excess facilities  will be paid over the respective lease terms through june using cash from operations 
the current and long term portions of the restructuring accrual of  and  are classified as accrued liabilities and other liabilities  respectively  in the consolidated balance sheet as of july  we continually evaluate the balance of the restructuring reserve we recorded in prior periods based on the remaining estimated amounts to be paid 
differences  if any  between the estimated amounts accrued and the actual amounts paid will be reflected in operating expenses in future periods 
we believe that the above restructurings have contributed towards the improvement in our gross and operating income during fiscal and we expect the cost savings  particularly in facility related costs  brought about by these restructurings to continue for fiscal future savings are anticipated to include approximately  primarily in operating expenses each year for the next few years from our fiscal workforce reduction and  and  in fiscal and  respectively  in facility related expenditures 
costs relating to ceased acquisition 
during fiscal and  we incurred residual costs of approximately  and  for operating expenses  mainly legal and accounting  relating to an acquisition that we ceased pursuing 
interest income year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage interest income as percentage of total revenue interest income represents interest earned on cash and short term investments and realized gains on miscellaneous investments 
the decrease in net interest income for fiscal was due to lower rate of interest on reduced balances of cash and investments  particularly during the first two quarters of fiscal interest expense year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage interest expense as percentage of total revenue interest expense for fiscal reflects interest charge associated with the convertible senior notes we issued in march litigation settlement gain  net year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage litigation settlement gain  net  n a as percentage of total revenue the gain of  net of  related expenses incurred  in the third quarter of fiscal resulted from the settlement of litigation against extended systems 
other  net year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage other  net as percentage of total revenue other  net  represents miscellaneous bank fees and charges  realized gain or loss on foreign exchange and investments and amortization of debt issuance costs 
other  net  for fiscal reflects  of debt issuance costs amortization expense associated with the convertible senior notes we issued in march and  of bank charges and investment management fees  net realized gain on foreign exchange and other expenses 
other  net for fiscal reflects mainly bank charges and investment management fees 
other than temporary impairment of investments year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage other than temporary impairment of investments n a  as percentage of total revenue during fiscal  we disposed our limited partnership interest in azure venture partners  llp  a venture capital fund 
the disposal of the interest allowed us to avoid commitments for further investments in equity instruments of various privately held companies made through azure  many of which had not generated adequate returns 
in addition  the disposal was in line with our strategy of focusing resources and efforts more on our core operations 
consequently  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of  total proceeds of  from the sale of the interest were received in may  which approximated the carrying value of the investment after the writedown 
provision for income taxes year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage provision for income taxes as percentage of total revenue the provision for income taxes primarily represents foreign withholding taxes on royalties earned from certain foreign customers and  to a lesser extent  state franchise and income taxes and estimated taxes for foreign subsidiaries 
the increase in the provision for income taxes for fiscal was due to increase in royalty revenue received from international oem customers  as well as accrued income and various taxes for our newly acquired foreign subsidiaries 
fiscal year ended july  as compared to fiscal year ended july  revenue year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage total revenue the revenue growth in fiscal was led by a or approximately  increase in revenue from professional services 
this increase in revenue from professional services represents approximately of our services revenue for fiscal license revenue year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage license revenue as percentage of total revenue license revenue in fiscal remained flat at  as compared with  in fiscal as the revenue increase from our enterprise and retail products and technology licensing components of approximately  offset the decrease in our revenue from legacy personal computers or notebooks business intellisync for notebooks royalty revenue 
notebook revenue decreased to an insignificant amount in fiscal as we deemphasized the resources and efforts associated with this revenue segment 
services revenue year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage services revenue as percentage of total revenue the increase in services revenue in fiscal resulted from an increase in professional service revenue associated with our technology licensing partners of approximately  as well as an increase in amortization of our maintenance contract programs of  triggered by our increased effort to renew maintenance agreements within the existing customer base 
slightly over of the increase in our services revenue was contributed by starfish 
enterprise and retail products year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage enterprise and retail products revenue as percentage of total revenue the growth in enterprise and retail products revenue in fiscal resulted from an increase in revenue from amortization of support and maintenance  as well as the increase in revenue brought about by the new version of our intellisync software and enterprise intellisync server launched during the year 
technology licensing components year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage technology licensing components revenue as percentage of total revenue the increase in technology licensing revenue resulted from an increase in professional service of approximately  and intellisync software development platform formerly intellisync sdk revenue of approximately  offset by a decrease in revenue from intellisync for notebooks royalties and the online hosting service offerings 
international revenue year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage international revenue as percentage of total revenue the year over year increase in our international revenues accounted for of our total revenue increase for fiscal the increase in our professional services revenue and the number of our international technology licensing partners  particularly in japan  resulted in an increase in our international revenue in fiscal top customers products sold through ingram micro us  a distributor  accounted for and of our total revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
no other customers accounted for more than of total revenue during those periods 
cost of revenue year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage total cost of revenue as percentage of total revenue cost of license revenue year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage cost of license revenue as percentage of license revenue the moderate increase in cost of license revenue in absolute dollars in fiscal resulted from the increase in overall revenue from enterprise and retail products 
cost of services revenue year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage cost of services revenue as percentage of services revenue the decrease in cost of revenue in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue for fiscal reflected cost savings in professional services resulting from contracting certain software development activities to lower cost international development partners  as well as from the effect of workforce reductions we implemented in fiscal to our personnel related costs  more particularly at the beginning of the fiscal year 
the decrease was also partly due to reduced online service costs associated with the online service offerings discontinued in fiscal the decrease in cost of services revenue for fiscal was offset by the  noncash variable accounting charge associated with certain outstanding stock options as a result of an increase in our stock price 
navisite legal contingency 
during fiscal  navisite  inc  a company that formerly provided certain web site hosting and related services to us  alleged that we improperly terminated a service agreement with and were thereby indebted to navisite 
we reached a settlement with navisite and paid a total of  inclusive of fees for the services previously provided  during fiscal the total amount of the settlement was not significantly different from the established loss contingency reserve 
amortization of developed and core technology year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage amortization of developed and core technology as percentage of total revenue developed and core technology amounted to  and  net of accumulated amortization  as of july  and  respectively 
the fully amortized purchased technology effected the decrease  net of the effect of those newly acquired  in the amortization of developed and core technology in fiscal research and development year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage research and development as percentage of total revenue the decrease in research and development spending in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal was due to realization of benefits  particularly at the first part of fiscal  from the workforce reduction and consolidation of engineering facilities  as well as elimination of online service operations  implemented in the last two quarters of fiscal our engineering workforce was reduced by employees during fiscal the benefits  in turn  resulted in a decrease in personnel related costs and other costs 
the decrease was also due to savings in overall engineering costs resulting from contracting engineering activities to lower cost international development partners 
sales and marketing year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage sales and marketing as percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal due to a  reduction in corporate marketing resources  corporate branding initiatives and other related costs as a result of lower planned spending 
personnel related costs also decreased by  as a result of headcount reductions in the last two quarters of fiscal the decrease in personnel related costs was offset by a  increase in bonus and commission as a result of an increase in overall revenue 
general and administrative year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage general and administrative as percentage of total revenue the major factors for the increase in general and administrative spending in fiscal include an increase in our stock price that resulted in a significant increase of  in noncash variable accounting charge for fiscal associated with certain outstanding stock options and an increase of  in outside services brought about primarily by legal costs associated with patent infringement lawsuits outstanding at the time 
the increase was offset by a decrease of  in personnel related costs  the absence of  special charge incurred in fiscal  a substantial reduction in our past due accounts receivable balances effecting a favorable decrease of  on our bad debt expense provisions for the year and a decrease in other costs of  as a result of lower planned spending 
in process research and development year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage in process research and development as percentage of total revenue the purchase price of starfish was assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired  including the in process research and development 
as of the acquisition date  technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been established and the technology had no alternative future use 
accordingly  we expensed the in process research and development of  associated with starfish at the date of the acquisition 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to in process research and technology was based on established valuation techniques used in the high technology software industry 
the fair value assigned to the acquired in process research and development was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the key assumptions used in the valuation include  among others  expected completion date of the in process projects identified as of the acquisition date  estimated costs to complete the projects  revenue contributions and expense projections assuming the resulting product has entered the market  and discount rate based on the risks associated with the development life cycle of the in process technology acquired 
the discount rate used in the present value calculations is normally obtained from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted upward to account for the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in process research and development  the expected profitability levels of such technology  and the uncertainty of technological advances that could potentially impact the estimates 
we assume the pricing model for the resulting product of the acquired in process research and technology to be standard within its industry 
we  however  did not take into consideration any consequential amount of expense reductions from integrating the acquired in process technology with other existing in process or completed technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include significant anticipated cost savings 
the key assumptions underlying the valuation of acquired in process research and development from are as follows in thousands project name mercury platform technology percent completed as of acquisition date estimated costs to complete technology at acquisition date  risk adjusted discount rate first period expected revenue calendar year the development of the above technology remains highly dependent on the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for a new product  and significant competitive threats from several companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop this technology into a commercially viable product consists primarily of planning  designing  experimenting  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technology can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring the product to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets  and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
subsequent to the acquisition of starfish  there have been no significant developments related to the current status of the acquired in process research and development projects that would result in material changes to the assumptions 
amortization of goodwill year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage amortization of goodwill as percentage of total revenue total net value of goodwill at july  and was  sfas no 
established new guidance on how to account for goodwill and intangible assets after a business combination is completed 
among other things  it requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets no longer be amortized and be tested for impairment at least annually and written down only when impaired 
we adopted sfas no 
effective august  accordingly  upon adoption of the new standard  we ceased to amortize our existing goodwill 
we also completed the impairment test required and the first annual impairment review in january and july  respectively  and did not identify any impairment 
amortization of other intangibles year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage amortization of other intangibles as percentage of total revenue other intangible assets  excluding developed and core technology  amounted to  and zero  net of accumulated amortization  as of july  and  respectively 
the amortization of other intangibles in fiscal was associated with the acquired intangibles from starfish and loudfire 
restructuring and other charges 
year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage restructuring charges severance costs facilities costs assets held for disposal other charges restructuring charges other charges separation costs costs relating to a ceased acquisition other charges restructuring and other charges as percentage of total revenue restructuring charges and accrual 
during fiscal and  we implemented a number of cost reduction plans aimed at reducing costs that were not integral to our overall strategy  better aligning our expense levels with current revenue levels and ensuring conservative spending during periods of economic uncertainty 
these initiatives included a reduction in workforce and facilities consolidation 
in fiscal  we incurred approximately  for severance and separation costs relating to recent termination of of our engineering and product management employees 
we also incurred a charge of approximately  for a revised estimated lease exit cost due to additional time required to sublease the facilities 
this revision was attributable to the high vacancy rates in the corporate real estate market in northern california 
the following table sets forth the activities in the restructuring accrual account for the periods presented in thousands workforce reduction consolidation of excess facilities other total balance at july  restructuring provision adjustment non cash charges cash payments balance at july  restructuring provision adjustment cash payments balance at july  the current and long term portions of the restructuring accrual of  and  are classified as accrued liabilities and other liabilities  respectively  in the consolidated balance sheet as of july  refer to the discussion under the caption fiscal year ended july  as compared to fiscal year ended july  set forth above for the remaining unpaid amount as of july  and other details associated with the restructuring accrual 
separation costs in fiscal  we recorded accruals of approximately  related to separation agreements with our former president and chief executive officer and former executive vice president of sales and business development 
costs relating to ceased acquisition 
during fiscal  we incurred residual costs of approximately  for operating expenses  mainly legal and accounting  relating to an acquisition that we ceased pursuing 
impairment of assets year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage intangibles commitment assets held and used assets held for disposal impairment of assets as percentage of total revenue during fiscal  we determined that certain intangible assets we acquired  certain assets used exclusively for our online operations and intellisync 
com were impaired 
therefore  we recorded an impairment charge of  in fiscal to write down or write off goodwill and certain intangibles in connection with our previous years acquisitions of proxinet  inc  dry creek software  the windward group and swifttouch corporation  and other assets  as well as a related commitment  we believe will not bring a viable business opportunity for us in the future 
proxinet we purchased proxinet in the first quarter of fiscal in anticipation of broadening the appeal of internet connected wireless devices and other internet appliances through the use of proxinet s core technology  proxiware and proxiweb  later branded as the browse it tm product 
by combining our intellisync platform with this highly scalable proxy based transformation and delivery architecture  major internet destinations such as portals  search engines and e commerce companies would have the means to provide highly secure  real time access to users of handheld devices  mobile phones and other devices and internet appliances 
we expected that users would be able to browse information online  while simultaneously retrieving and synchronizing critical information while offline 
at the time the proxinet s acquisition was consummated  we planned to market browse it primarily to major internet companies such as portals and e commerce sites as well as cellular carriers and other wireless providers 
browse it started generating revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal  but at a level substantially lower than what we originally expected average quarterly revenue for fiscal was approximately  in addition  due to general economic slowdowns  several of our browse it customers  many of which are internet companies  reduced their it spending or ceased their investment in products  services and technologies such as those we provide 
consequently  revenue from browse it continued to deteriorate  decreasing as low as  by the fourth quarter of fiscal these factors demonstrated that browse it product would not bring sufficient revenue to absorb high related costs 
by the end of fiscal  as part of our plan to refocus our business strategies  we decided to discontinue our browse it technology offerings 
related employees were either terminated or reassigned to other engineering functions 
furthermore  we determined that browse it technology has no alternative uses and had not been incorporated into other products or services  and  accordingly  recorded in fiscal an impairment write off of  and  related to the net book value of goodwill and developed and core technology  respectively  from the proxinet acquisition 
other impaired assets the plan to focus effort on our core business necessitated a thorough review of certain operations and related assets that we believed would not be viable to integrate into our new strategies 
our plan provided for no further support for online operations  as well as terminating the use and maintenance of excess related assets 
during fiscal  in our review of our online operations and related assets  such as computers  servers  network and other hosting related equipment  we specifically identified those assets that would be held for use to finish preexisting contracts with certain customers for a short period of time  after which the assets would be disposed of or abandoned 
we also identified the related assets that would be held for immediate disposal 
based on a recoverability analysis we performed of the assets carrying value  we anticipated no further cash flows from the online operations 
we  therefore  recorded an impairment charge of  and  for assets held for use and assets held for disposal  respectively  based on the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeded the recovery value less disposal costs 
we determined the recovery value of the assets using our best estimates on market prices of similar assets 
in addition  we wrote off related hosting commitment with a third party vendor  a related party  for its entire value  totaling  interest income year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage interest income as percentage of total revenue interest income  representing interest earned on cash and short term investments and realized gains on miscellaneous investments decreased in fiscal due to lower rate of interest on reduced balances of cash and investments 
interest expense year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage interest expense as percentage of total revenue interest expense for fiscal and reflects interest charge associated with a revolving credit line agreement that expired in september the line of credit was not renewed 
other  net year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage other  net as percentage of total revenue other  net for fiscal and reflects mainly bank charges and investment management fees 
other than temporary impairment of investments year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage other than temporary impairment of investments as percentage of total revenue during fiscal  we disposed our limited partnership interest in azure venture partners  llp  a venture capital fund 
the disposal of the interest allowed us to avoid commitments for further investments in equity instruments of various privately held companies made through azure  many of which had not generated adequate returns 
in addition  the disposal was in line with our strategy of focusing resources and efforts more on our core operations 
consequently  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of  total proceeds of  from the sale of the interest were received in may  which approximated the carrying value of the investment after the writedown 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge for an other than temporary impairment of investments of approximately  related to our pro rata share of net loss realized by azure on sale or liquidation of certain investments 
provision for income taxes year ended july  percent change in thousands  except percentage provision for income taxes as percentage of total revenue the provision for income taxes primarily represents foreign withholding taxes on royalties earned from certain foreign customers and  to a lesser extent  state franchise and income taxes and estimated taxes for foreign subsidiaries 
recently issued accounting pronouncements consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
in december  the fasb released a revised version of fin no 
referred to as fin r clarifying certain aspects of fin no 
and providing certain entities with exemptions from the requirements of fin no 
fin r requires the application of either fin no 
or fin r to all special purpose entities  or spes created prior to february  at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december  all entities created after january  were already required to be analyzed under fin no 
 and they must continue to do so  unless fin r is adopted early 
fin r is applicable to all non spes created prior to february  at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  the adoption of fin r during the third quarter of fiscal did not have a material impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
other than temporary impairment in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf no 
includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity investments  as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
the disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after june  we have adopted the disclosure requirements in fiscal accordingly and incorporated such disclosures in note to consolidated financials statements set forth in part iv of this annual report on form k 
the accounting guidance of eitf no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and we believe that the adoption will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
earnings per share in april  the eitf issued statement no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share 
eitf no 
addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when  and if  it declares dividends on its common stock 
the issue also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating earnings per share  clarifying what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
eitf no 
is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  as of may   we have convertible debt that is subject to this pronouncement 
however  due to net loss for fiscal  the effect of the convertible debt under the eitf no 
is anti dilutive  as such it has not been included in basic or diluted earnings per share 
contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share in july  the eitf issued a draft abstract for eitf no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
eitf reflects the task force s tentative conclusion that contingently convertible debt should be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
if adopted  the consensus reached by the task force in this issue will be effective for reporting periods ending after december   the adoption of which will not have an impact on our calculation of earnings per share 
liquidity and capital resources in march  we completed our offering of  aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due march  through an offering to qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act  as amended 
proceeds of approximately  net of the initial purchasers discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs  were received in march refer to the discussion under the caption commitments set forth below for more information on the convertible senior notes 
working capital the following summarizes our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital year ended july  percent change percent change in thousands  except percentages and ratios cash and cash equivalents short term investments year ended july  percent change percent change in thousands  except percentages and ratios working capital current ratio we invest excess cash in fixed income securities that are highly liquid  of high quality investment grade 
we intend to make such funds readily available for operating purposes  if needed 
in addition to the above cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at july   we have a total of  restricted cash that is pledged as collateral for certain stand by letters of credit issued by certain financial institutions and collateral to match any unfavorable mark to market exposure on an interest swap agreement 
refer to the discussion under the caption restricted cash set forth below for more information 
the significant factors underlying the increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments during fiscal were net proceeds from issuance of convertible senior notes of  offset by acquisitions of  and net cash flow used in operations of  this increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments resulted in an increase in working capital and current ratio 
the significant factor underlying the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and investments during fiscal was the net cash flow used in operations of  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in short term investments  and the slight increase in the current ratio was primarily due to a decrease in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue and the absence of borrowings at july  cash flows operating activities 
significant items included in cash flows from operating activities are as follows in thousands year ended july  change change net cash used in operating activities the majority of cash applied to cash working capital for the current fiscal year resulted from increases in accounts receivable of  generally consistent with our revenue growth and effected by recent acquisitions and other current assets of  offset by all other assets of  accounts payable and accrued liabilities also decreased by approximately  due to timing of payments particularly of litigation costs and other expenses associated with recent acquisitions 
offsetting the net decrease in working capital was an increase in deferred revenue of  investing activities 
significant items included in cash flows from investing activities are as follows in thousands year ended july  change change net sale maturities purchase of short term investments acquisitions and other investments decrease increase in restricted cash capital expenditures net cash used in provided by investing activities the net cash flows used in investing activities during fiscal and were due primarily to cash movement between investments and cash and cash equivalents and  in fiscal  acquisitions of spontaneous technology  synchrologic and ssa and increase in restricted cash associated with a collateral under an interest rate swap agreement 
for the prior fiscal year  uses included the acquisitions of starfish and loudfire 
financing activities 
significant items included in cash flows from financing activities are as follows in thousands year ended july  change change net proceeds from long term debt proceeds from stock option exercises payments on borrowings other net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal  cash flow generated from financing activities includes  in proceeds  net of debt issuance costs  from our recent senior notes offering 
we repaid  of debt acquired from synchrologic in fiscal and  of debt under a line of credit in fiscal our future cash flows from stock options are difficult to project as such amounts are a function of our stock price  the number of options outstanding  and the decisions by employees to exercise stock options 
in general  we expect proceeds from stock option exercises to increase during periods in which our stock price has increased relative to historical levels 
acquisitions in june  we acquired through a transfer employees from softvision srl pursuant to an employee transfer agreement dated as of february  under the terms of the agreement  we paid cash of approximately  and assumed certain employee related liabilities of approximately  the softvision s workforce acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase 
the consolidated financial statements include the effect of additional employees the company acquired from softvision since the date of acquisition 
in march  we completed our acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding stock of ssa and paid cash of  net of  cash acquired  under the terms of the purchase agreement 
in december  we completed our acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding stock of synchrologic 
in the merger  all outstanding shares of synchrologic common stock and preferred stock were converted into the right to receive a total of  shares of our common stock valued at approximately  in addition  all outstanding options to purchase synchrologic common stock were converted into options to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock and were valued at approximately in september  we acquired spontaneous technology and issued a total of  shares of our common stock valued at approximately  under the terms of the acquisition agreement 
there were  additional shares held in escrow that were contingently issuable upon satisfaction of a pre acquisition clause 
later during fiscal  the contingency was resolved and we paid cash of approximately  the contingent consideration shares in escrow were therefore returned to us accordingly 
additionally  depending upon our revenues associated with sales of our products including certain technology of spontaneous technology during the period ending september   we may be required to pay spontaneous technology additional consideration of up to  in shares of our common stock 
the earnout period ended on september  with our aggregate revenue on products associated with spontaneous technology amounting to less than the given earnout threshold 
consequently  no additional consideration was or will be paid to spontaneous technology 
over the next few quarters  we believe the acquisition of spontaneous technology  synchrologic and ssa  may bring modest improvement in our cash flows from operating activities with the realization of synergistic benefits and revenue opportunities 
effects of inflation we believe that our financial results have not been significantly impacted by inflation and price changes during fiscal  and litigation settlement with extended systems on march   we announced our mutual agreement with extended systems  inc to settle our patent infringement lawsuit we initiated in april against extended systems 
in the agreement  we agreed with extended systems to settle all claims and terminate litigation proceedings immediately in exchange for a one time payment of  commitments capital lease 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a capital lease agreement for a phone system  which expires in february assets and future obligations related to the capital lease are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of july  in property and equipment and liabilities  respectively 
current and long term portions of the capital lease amounted to  and  respectively  at july  depreciation of assets held under the capital lease is included in depreciation and amortization expense 
operating leases 
we lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through august the leases provide for escalating lease payments 
convertible senior notes 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the offering of  of convertible senior notes to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on rule a under the securities act 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the final maturity date of the notes  subject to prior redemption of the notes 
the initial conversion rate is shares per each  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment for certain events  including the payment of dividends  and other events specified in the indenture 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum 
interest on the notes will be paid on march and on september of each year 
the first payment was made on september  all costs and expenses incurred with the issuance of the offering have been capitalized within other assets and amortized over five years  the life of the respective debt 
such costs amounted to approximately  net of accumulated amortization of  as of july  proceeds of approximately  net of the initial purchasers discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs  were received from the offering in march a portion of the net proceeds of the offering were used to complete the acquisition of ssa 
we intend to use the balance of the net proceeds to fund possible investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies or establishing joint ventures and for general corporate purposes and working capital requirements 
we invested the net proceeds from this offering  pending their ultimate use  in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
interest rate swaps 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution on a total notional amount of  and  whereby we receive fixed rate interest of in exchange for variable interest payments 
the interest rate swaps expire upon the maturity of our  convertible senior notes in march  and effectively converts those fixed rate notes into variable rate borrowings 
the interest rate is reset semi annually and is equal to the month libor rate less a rate spread 
the total variable interest rate was approximately at july   resulting in interest expense savings relative to fixed rates of approximately  for fiscal under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  this arrangement has been designated and qualifies as an effective fair value hedge of interest rate risk related to the  convertible senior notes 
as the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt  the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying value of the hedged debt  and therefore does not impact our net earnings 
as of july   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was approximately  and recorded in other liabilities with an equal adjustment recorded to the carrying value of the  convertible senior notes 
the following table summarizes our material obligations and commitments to make future payments  for which we anticipate using cash from operations  under certain contracts  including long term debt obligations and operating leases as of july  in thousands fiscal year ending july  total convertible senior notes interest rate swap capital lease obligation operating leases operating leases proceeds from subleases net operating leases total interest on the senior notes and interest rate swap is payable in cash on march and september of each year 
the senior notes mature on march  includes interest payments due 
other 
in the event of early termination of a service agreement with e deltacom  a managed service provider  we are required to pay e deltacom a penalty fee of  based on the july monthly service rate  up to approximately  capital expenditures we expect total capital expenditures of approximately  for fiscal principally for support of the hosting operations and purchase of computers and other various system upgrades 
restricted cash we have three letters of credit that collateralize certain operating lease obligations and total approximately  and  at july  and  respectively 
we collateralize these letters of credit with cash deposits made with three of our financial institutions and have classified the short term and the long term portions of approximately  and  at july   and  and  at july  as other current assets and restricted cash  respectively  in the consolidated balance sheets 
the long term portion expires through june the holders of the letters of credit are able to draw on each respective letter of credit in the event that we are found to be in default of our obligations under each of our operating leases 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement into which we entered during fiscal  we must provide collateral to match any unfavorable mark to market exposure fair value on the swap 
the amount of collateral required totals a minimum of  plus an amount equal to the unfavorable mark to market exposure on the swap 
generally  the required collateral will rise as interest rates rise 
as of july   we have posted approximately  of collateral under this swap agreement which is included in restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  including the net proceeds from convertible senior notes offering and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next months 
beyond the next months  we expect our cash flow from operations and the remaining proceeds from convertible senior notes to remain sufficient to fund any ongoing investments in capital equipment and interest payments on our notes 
there are no arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital 
we believe that the most strategic uses of our cash resources include strategic investments to gain access to new technologies  acquisitions  financing activities  and working capital 
therefore  from time to time  we may consider additional acquisitions and a wide range of other business opportunities 
to the extent that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances and cash flow from operations are insufficient to fund any new acquisition  business opportunity or venture  as well as to fund future operating requirements  we may seek to raise cash through further issuance of debt or equity securities 
we cannot be certain that such financing would be available to us at all  or on terms favorable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations  which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
interest rate risk at july   we had an investment portfolio of mostly fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents and securities available for sale  of  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of july   the decline of the fair value of the portfolio would be immaterial 
we attempt to mitigate risk by holding our fixed income investments until maturity to avoid recognizing an adverse impact in income or cash flows in the event of an increase in market interest rates  but an increase in our liquidity needs may require us to sell fixed rate securities prior to maturity 
the table below presents the carrying value which approximates fair value and related weighted average coupon interest rates for our investment portfolio at july  in thousands  except interest rates 
carrying amount average coupon interest rate cash equivalents securities with maturity due within one year or less due after one year through two years annuities  auction rate preferred stock  auction rate receipts and other  with no maturity total portfolio debt and interest expense 
we recently incurred  of principal indebtedness from the issuance of convertible senior notes in march the fair market value of these convertible senior notes is sensitive to changes in interest rates and to the prices of our common stock into which it can be converted as well as our financial stability 
in order to manage interest costs and risk  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement during fiscal with a financial institution on a total notional amount of  and  whereby we receive fixed rate interest of in exchange for variable interest payments 
the interest rate swaps expire upon the maturity of our  convertible senior notes in march  and effectively converts those fixed rate notes into variable rate borrowings 
the interest rate is reset semi annually and is equal to the month libor rate less a rate spread 
the total variable interest rate was approximately at july   resulting in interest expense savings relative to fixed rates of approximately  for the fiscal year 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  this arrangement has been designated and qualifies as an effective fair value hedge of interest rate risk related to the  convertible senior notes 
as the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt  the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying value of the hedged debt  and therefore does not impact our net earnings 
as of july   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was approximately  with an equal adjustment recorded to the carrying value of the  convertible senior notes 
assuming a one percentage point increase in the prevailing libor rate  holding other terms of the swap constant  the fair value of the interest rate swap and the underlying senior notes would change by approximately  foreign currency risk to date  the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our financial statements has been immaterial 
however  with our recent acquisitions of synchrologic and ssa  more of our product and services revenue has been derived from international markets and denominated in the currency of the applicable market 
as we increasingly pursue business opportunities in foreign countries  our foreign revenues and operating results may become subject to significant currency fluctuations based upon changes in exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into united states dollar in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the applicable balance sheet date and any resulting translation adjustments are included as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
revenues and expenses generated from these subsidiaries are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the quarter the transactions occur 
gains and losses from these currency transactions are included in net earnings 
recently  we have increasingly generated a portion of our revenues and incurred a portion of our expenses in euros  british pounds  the japanese yen and australian dollars 
we currently do not have any hedging or similar foreign currency contracts to mitigate our exposure to the risk of changes in foreign currency rates 
although we may begin to hedge in the future  we cannot be sure that any hedging techniques we may implement will be successful or that our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows will not be adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
we may continue to expand internationally in the future and become increasingly subject to other risks of doing business internationally including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  and other regulations and restrictions 
we will also be exposed to increased risk of non payment by our customers in foreign countries  especially those of highly inflationary economies 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these and other factors 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products and services less competitive in international markets
