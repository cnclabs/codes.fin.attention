results of operations general the company reports and analyzes its operations based on the markets the company serves 
the company s reportable segments are shelter services  metal stamping and food services 
the shelter services segment provides shelter and assembly services in mexico for non electronics manufacturing services companies 
under the contract manufacturing model  elamex provides labor and administrative services 
under the assembly business model  elamex provides shared manufacturing space  production management and may also provide material procurement services 
the metal stamping segment is composed solely of precision tool  die and machine company precision  our wholly owned subsidiary located in louisville  kentucky 
it provides metal and stamping services primarily to the appliance and automotive sectors 
on december   precision filed for protection under us federal bankruptcy laws 
precision revenues and expenses are consolidated through december  commencing on that date  elamex accounts for precision under the equity method of accounting 
the food services segment is the franklin business  which operates a retail nut and foodservice nut packaging and marketing business  located in el paso  texas and a candy manufacturing and packaging facility located in juarez  mexico 
this business was acquired in july operations overview for the year ended december   elamex and subsidiaries reported a net loss of million 
of that amount  million is attributable to precision  million is attributable to qualcore s 
de rl de rl qualcore  million is attributable to our shelter services companies shelter  and million is attributable to franklin connections lp franklin 
precision on december   elamex announced that precision filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws 
elamex acquired precision in precision experienced net losses and sales decreases in and because of a combination of adverse business conditions  including a depressed national economy and from the inability to gain pricing control 
in operating losses surged  reducing liquidity and triggering conditions of default under credit agreements 
precision broadened its product lines in by undertaking the manufacture of new products with greater complexity and substantially higher unit value 
although the profit potential of these new products was attractive  manufacturing costs and problems far exceeded expectations during this first year of production 
precision launched this product line expansion during a year in which it had begun using a new manufacturing accounting module  a critical step in its ongoing implementation of an enterprise software system 
implementation problems in the costing module delayed the recognition of production problems 
prior to precision had difficulties in its efforts to comply with some terms of its borrowing agreements 
the primary lending bank waived loan covenant violations as of december   and those occurring prior to the date on which the company recognized the need to record an adverse inventory adjustment of million in the third quarter financial statements 
the combined operating losses through november caused a critical liquidity problem and caused conditions of default under the terms of bank loans 
in view of the problems associated with manufacturing in this industry  and of the overall strategy and financial condition of elamex  the company made strategic decisions in the fourth quarter of to refrain from extending additional internal funding to precision  and to engage a firm to sell its interest in precision 
generally accepted accounting principles require an evaluation of impairment of long lived assets under circumstances such as those encountered by precision in the fourth quarter 
the results of an independent valuation dictated the fourth quarter recognition of an impairment charge of million for long lived assets other than goodwill  plus an impairment charge of million for goodwill 
this reduction of goodwill is in addition to a million goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of precision s net loss  inclusive of these expenses  reduced elamex s investment in precision to zero 
because the investment in precision is now recorded under the equity method of accounting and because elamex does not guarantee any of the debt of precision  elamex does not expect to record any further losses in connection with precision 
qualcore despite year ago expectations of a turnaround  elamex continued to experience disappointing results in from its joint venture investment in qualcore 
this mexican manufacturing operation struggles in its efforts to gain volume in an environment in which the manufacture of competing goods has been shifting to asia for cost reasons 
after a series of disappointing losses  elamex and its venture partner have reached a firm decision to sell qualcore  and are actively pursuing its sale 
shelter in july elamex sold most of its mexican shelter service operations  realizing a gain of million 
shelter services are now limited to a franklin affiliate 
in addition to providing shelter services  this group owns and leases buildings to third parties in mexico 
franklin upon the culmination of actions initiated in  the elamex business operations will primarily be limited in the near term future to those of franklin  its general line candy manufacturer and retail food service nut packing company 
franklin sales and gross profits have grown impressively since franklin entered the business of manufacturing and distributing candy in through the end of franklin has yet to report a profit on combined nut and candy operations  but the trends reflect good progress toward achieving planned revenue levels and market share objectives 
gross profit margins have improved while operating costs have decreased as a percentage of sales 
franklin operations include candy manufacturing and nut processing 
franklin sales and distribution services are directed to the food service industry and to retailers and wholesalers of candies and nuts 
franklin gained substantial market share in sales of candy to mass market retailers in  and improved market penetration to the retail grocery industry 
franklin is progressively de emphasizing sales to customers that purchase bulk candies and bag them for resale to retailers rebaggers 
by eliminating the middleman  gross profit margins on sales to retailers are significantly higher than on sales to rebaggers 
in addition to making candy for sales through its own distribution channels  franklin makes candy on a contract manufacturing basis for other candy producers 
compared to management s discussion and analysis is based on the results of operations by segment as presented in the following table in thousands unallocated shelter metal food services corporate inter services stamping and other segment total year ended december  net sales      gross profit loss     operating expenses      other expense income      year ended december  net sales      gross profit     operating expenses      other expense income     segment deconsolidated effective december  acquired at the beginning of the third quarter of includes sale between segments in the normal course of business certain shelter operations were sold in july net sales net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for prior year 
sales for shelter services decreased to million for the current year from million for the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to the sale of certain customer s contracts at the end of the second quarter 
sales also decreased due to available buildings that were not rented until the second and the third quarter of sales for metal stamping decreased to million for the current year from million for the prior year 
the decrease was mainly due to decreases in customers orders resulting from a slowdown in end market demand in the major appliances industry during the year  also due to the deconsolidation of this segment after precision voluntarily filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws on december  sales for food service were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the six month period subsequent to the acquisition of this segment in the million increase was caused primarily by the comparison of year and six month periods 
the rate of growth results principally from increase in the sale of candy distributed for sale in the retail market  a relatively new product line compared to the segment s nut business 
contract manufacturing of candy is also a relatively new line of business resulting in increased sales for the segment 
gross profit gross profit increased to million for year ended december  from million in prior year

additionally  gross margins were adversely affected by a high level of start up costs and low efficiencies associated with new product lines and breakdown of machines during the third quarter 
problems with implementation of new cost accounting software delayed the recognition of production problems 
gross profit for food services was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the six month period subsequent to the acquisition of this segment in the million increase was caused primarily by the comparison of year and six month periods

other expense income other expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in other income for shelter services for the year ended december  was million compared to other expense of thousand recorded in the increase of other income was primarily due to a gain on the sale of certain customers contracts of million recorded in the second quarter of other expense for metal stamping decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the decrease was primarily due to a recognition of loss in fixed assets of approximately thousand in not incurred in  partially offset by the recognition of thousand of losses after the deconsolidation of the segment in the fourth quarter of other expenses for food services were million for the year ended december  compared to million recorded in the six month period subsequent to the acquisition of this segment in other expenses for corporate increased to million for the year ended december  from million recorded in the increase was primarily due to an increase in losses of unconsolidated joint venture of thousand

liquidity and capital resources elamex s working capital defined as current assets  minus current liabilities decreased to million as of december   from million as of december   a decrease of million 
as of december   precision had an outstanding balance under its revolving line of bank credit of million 
that liability was classified in the long term liability section of the consolidated balance sheet because the loan had a maturity date that was more than months from the balance sheet date 
if that loan had been classified as a current liability as of december   the company s consolidated working capital would have been million less than the million that was reported 
therefore  the substantial majority of the working capital reduction in is attributable to the changes at precision 
as a consequence of precision s filing for protection under bankruptcy laws on december   the company no longer controls precision s operations 
accordingly  as of december  the company s investment in precision is reported under the equity method of accounting rather than being consolidated into the company s financial statements 
the available cash for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   elamex operating activities provided net cash of million 
changes in current assets and current liabilities balances provided cash of million  and a net loss for the year  adjusted for non cash items  reduced the net increase by million 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was million 
of this amount  million was used to buy new equipment and million was invested in the joint venture with ge de mexico 
these amounts were partially offset by million of net cash proceeds from the sale of certain shelter services operations 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december   was million  which is primarily due to debt repayments of million  offset by additional debt incurred of million 
management believes that existing working capital  cash flows from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and investment activities 
the company does not intend to fund any of the cash requirements of precision 
at december   we had contractual cash obligations to repay debt  to make payments under leases and purchase obligations 
payments due under these long term obligations are as follows payments due by period in thousands of us dollars remaining in and contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt obligations    gross capital lease obligation      operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations      estimated taxes and interest to be paid in are million and million  respectively 
controlling shareholder elamex was acquired by accel  sa de sa and certain other investors in may  and is controlled by accel  sa de sa elamex  sa de sa is the successor pursuant to the merger  effective october  the effective date  of elamex internacional with and into elamex  sa de sa exchange rates and inflation although elamex is a mexican corporation its functional currency is the us dollar  which is the principal currency in which it conducts business 
elamex maintains certain financial information in accordance with mexican gaap  but prepares consolidated financial statements in us dollars in conformity with us gaap 
in the following cases elamex s results of operations are generally affected by changes in the exchange rate between pesos and us dollars 
in the case of an appreciation in value of the us dollar against the peso  elamex generally experiences a benefit because its revenues are denominated in us dollars and certain of its costs and expenses are denominated in pesos 
this benefit will be reduced by relative inflation in the peso versus the us dollar due to inflation within mexico  and by competitive pressures from elamex s customers 
in the case of a depreciation of the us dollar against the peso  elamex generally experiences a detriment mirroring the situation as to appreciation of the dollar  and this detriment will similarly be reduced by relative inflation in the us dollar against the peso and increased pricing by elamex 
on october   the mexican government signed a pact with labor and business representatives called the alliance for economic growth the alliance 
the alliance defines a macroeconomic policy designed to support mexico s economic recovery and promote future growth 
under the alliance the mexican government has attempted to boost the economy by providing tax incentives for new business investments  while utilizing wage and price controls to contain inflation 
as part of the alliance the mexican government has committed to maintaining a free flotation system for the peso in the international currency markets 
the alliance also calls for development of social and rural programs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the more critical of these policies are as follows accrued rebates the company enters into contractual agreements for rebates on certain products with its customers 
such amounts are netted against sales and included in accrued advertising and promotions based on management estimates at the date the sales occur 
prepaid slotting allowances prepaid slotting allowances consist of payments to customers for store shelf space and distribution agreements and are amortized to sales revenue  as required by eitf using the straight line method over the term of the customer contract or proportionally with sales recorded  based on the nature of the slotting contract 
contracts generally vary in length from one to seven years and provide for fixed payments or payments upon achievement of sales benchmarks 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method  as required by sfas no 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under sfas no 
 the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
provisions for taxes are made based upon the applicable tax laws of mexico and the united states 
in conformity with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are not provided for differences related to assets and liabilities that are remeasured from pesos into us dollars using historical exchange rates and that result from inflation indexing for mexican tax purposes or exchange rate changes 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
the company estimates a valuation allowance based on the historical results of operations and expected results in each individual entity 
revenue recognition for metal stamping and food products  revenues are recognized at the time the order is shipped 
for contract manufacturing revenues are recognized when the order is shipped for manufacturing contracts and over the contract period for assembly services 
anticipated losses on assembly services contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determined 
allowances for bad debts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral to support amounts due for the sale of its products 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its best estimate of accounts receivable 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  goodwill  intangible assets and certain other assets  comprise a significant amount of our total assets 
we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires us to make long term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
elamex does not engage in futures contracts with the purpose of hedging us dollar peso revenues or costs  with the exception of regular treasury operations to cover operating requirements for up to days

employee statutory profit sharing all mexican companies are required to pay their employees  in addition to their agreed compensation benefits  profit sharing in an aggregate amount equal to of net income  calculated for employee statutory profit sharing purposes  of the individual corporation employing such employees 
all of elamex s mexico based employees are employed by its subsidiaries  each of which pays profit sharing in accordance with its respective net income for profit sharing purposes 
tax losses and other certain adjustments for us gaap purposes do not affect employee statutory profit sharing 
employee statutory profit sharing expense is reflected in elamex s cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses  depending upon the function of the employees to whom profit sharing payments are made 
elamex s net income on a consolidated basis as shown in the consolidated financial statements is not a meaningful indication of net income of elamex s subsidiaries for profit sharing purposes or of the amount of employee statutory profit sharing 
there was no employee statutory profit sharing expense for the years ended december    and income tax and asset tax the company s mexican subsidiaries are each required to pay an alternative minimum asset tax if the asset tax calculation is greater than income taxes payable for the year 
asset taxes are calculated at of assets less certain liabilities and can be carried forward for up to years as credits against future income taxes payable 
before any asset tax carry forwards can be applied  all net operating losses must be first utilized 
mexican companies have the option to defer the asset tax four years forward and determine the higher of the taxes comparing the current income tax calculation and the four year old asset tax calculation increased by the effects of inflation 
some of the company s subsidiaries have elected this option 
the total asset tax paid by the company s subsidiaries for the year ended december  was approximately thousand 
effective january   a tax rate was enacted in mexico whereby the corporate tax rate is 
an amount equal to is paid on taxable earnings reinvested in the company and on those earnings when they are distributed in the form of dividends for the year ended december  the tax law enacted january  eliminated the option to defer the payment of of taxable income and reduces the tax rate to in  in and thereafter

 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including a company s performance  the market environment in which the company operates  the utilization of past tax credits  length of carry back and carry forward periods  and existing contracts or sales backlog that will result in future profits  among other factors 
for  the company concluded that it was appropriate to increase the valuation allowance for most of the net deferred tax assets arising from its operations in mexico and in the united states 
as a result  the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in mexico and the united states increased by approximately million  resulting in additional income tax expense for the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
in addition  primarily as a consequence of precision s filing for protection under bankruptcy laws on december   the company s investment in precision  reported under the equity method of accounting  was reduced by an increase in the valuation allowance against precision s underlying deferred tax assets of million
