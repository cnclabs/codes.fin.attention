item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we were organized in and initially focused on the development and manufacture of gaas integrated circuits for low volume defense and aerospace applications 
in we began shifting our strategy to focus on radio frequency microwave communications systems for high volume applications  and began production for these applications in in we introduced integrated circuits for the cable television market 
in late we entered the wireless communications market with the introduction of cellular telephone integrated circuits 
in we introduced our ingap hbt power amplifier modules to the wireless communications market and in expanded into the wlan power amplifier marketplace 
we strive to achieve market advantage through the application of our radio frequency microwave design and application knowledge 
with our design expertise we have led the industry with the introduction of innovative products 
recent examples include quad band gsm gprs power amplifiers with integrated power control  high efficiency low power help tm mm x mm cdma pa modules  wideband cdma power amplifier modules  powerplexer tm integrated gsm front end modules  active splitter integrated circuits for cable infrastructure and set top box applications and high output b g wlan power amplifier modules  all of which offer greater levels of product performance and reduce manufacturers production costs 
we aim to achieve cost advantage through the scale and efficiency of our manufacturing operations 
during we began production in our six inch analog gaas wafer fabrication facility  which we believe was among the first six inch analog gaas wafer fabrication facility in our industry 
using a six inch wafer allows us to produce  at a small incremental cost  more than twice the integrated circuit die per wafer than can be produced from the industry norm four inch wafer 
during  we made two strategic acquisitions through the purchase of the wireless lan wlan power amplifier business of rf solutions  providing an entrance into the emerging and high growth wlan market  and the tavanza cdma power amplifier handset business from celeritek to enhance our customer and product expansion in the cdma market 
these businesses also provide us with enriched product portfolio  technology  know how and high volume capability 
our business outlook remains cautious after our markets weakened substantially during and remained weak throughout much of and with the well publicized deterioration in the telecommunications industry  we experienced a substantial decline in demand from levels for our products 
the downturn in demand reflected a reduction in capital spending by many of our customers and lower end consumer demand and was compounded by high component inventories at most of our customers  including components that we previously supplied 
reduced production volumes contributed to a significant decline in our gross margin and profitability from the levels achieved in many of our expenses  particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead  are fixed 
accordingly  reduced revenue causes our fixed production costs to increase as a percentage of revenue  which adversely affects our gross margin and profitability 
we will continue to strategically invest in research and development in order to maintain our competitive position 
the general slowdown in the industry in which we operate as well as the overall slowing of the economy has had  and could continue to have  a negative impact on our net sales  gross margins and other results of operations 
we cannot accurately predict whether or when demand will strengthen across all product lines 
if we are unable to reverse the recent trend of low revenues and net losses because the economy does not improve or because we under perform  our ability to compete in a very difficult market may be materially and adversely affected 
we have only one reportable segment 
for financial information related to such segment and certain geographic areas  see note to the accompanying financial statements 
critical accounting policies general we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
such accounting policies may require management to exercise a higher degree of judgment and make estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition production revenue is recorded when products are shipped to customers pursuant to a purchase order 
we charge customers for the costs of certain contractually committed inventories that remain at the end of a product s life 
cancellation revenue is recognized when cash is received 
the value of the inventory related to cancellation revenue may  in some instances  have been reserved during prior periods in accordance with our inventory obsolescence policy 
warranty costs we provide for potential warranty claims by recording a current charge to income 
we estimate potential claims by examining historical returns and other information deemed critical and provide for an amount which we believe will cover future warranty obligations for products sold during the year 
the accrued liability for warranty costs is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
long lived assets long lived assets include fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we regularly review these assets for circumstances of impairment and assess the carrying value of the assets against market values 
when an impairment exists  we record an expense to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
goodwill and intangibles impairment we have intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
significant judgements are involved in the determination of the estimated useful lives for our other intangibles and whether the goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations or expected to be disposed of when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flow estimated to be generated by these assets is less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
management considers sensitivities to capacity  utilization and technological developments in making its assumptions 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the amount may not be realized 
during  we determined that it was no longer more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  and an adjustment to provide a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset was charged to income 
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market lcm  using the first in  first out method 
in addition to lcm limitations  we reserve against inventory items for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is primarily based upon forecasted short term demand for the product and any change to the reserve arising from forecast revisions is reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers failure to make mandatory payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to erode  making them unable to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following table sets forth statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross loss profit research and development expenses selling and administrative expenses restructuring and other charges asset impairment charges goodwill impairment charge purchased in process r d operating loss interest income interest expense impairment of investments gain on repurchase of convertible notes other income expense loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes loss before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net loss compared to net sales 
net sales during decreased to million  compared to million for the sales decline was due to a decrease in demand of tdma power amplifiers used in cellular handsets resulting from a market shift in the us from the tdma air interface standard to the emergence and deployment of the cdma x telecommunication standard 
additionally  demand was lower for ic s used in set top boxes attributed to overall market softness for set top boxes 
specifically  net sales of integrated circuits for cellular and pcs applications decreased during to million from million in net sales for tdma power amplifiers declined to zero in from million in sales during of integrated circuits for broadband applications decreased to million from million in the decline was partially offset by sales of our power amplifiers used in wireless lan wlan applications 
on march   we purchased the power amplifier business of rf solutions rfs providing the company an entrance into the growing wlan power amplifier market 
generally  selling prices for same product sales were lower during as compared to gross margin 
gross margin for decreased to of net sales  compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the decline in gross margin from the prior year is the result of the decrease in revenue  lower production throughput in our facilities due to outsourcing and consequent lower absorption of fixed costs 
the aforementioned lower pricing was largely offset by savings related to lower test  assembly and raw material costs 
research development 
company sponsored research and development expense increased during to million from million during primarily due to the acquisition of the rfs power amplifier business on march  and the acquisition of the tavanza cdma wireless handset business from celeritek on october  purchased in process r d 
the company expensed purchased in process research and development costs of million resulting from the acquisitions of rfs and tavanza 
the charge represented the fair value of certain acquired research and development projects that were determined to have not reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses 
no acquisitions or in process r d applied in selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses decreased during to million from million in the decrease was primarily due to the elimination of intangibles amortization as a result of the write off of intangibles in the fourth quarter of and savings realized from the administrative headcount reductions resulting from our restructuring activities 
the expense reductions were partially offset by increased expenses from the rfs acquisition and the establishment of new application centers in taiwan and south korea 
asset and investment impairment charges and restructuring and other charges 
during  we recorded charges of million for restructuring and other charges related to severance and related employee benefits of workforce reductions of approximately operations and administrative positions and lease related costs 
the anticipated annual benefit from the workforce reductions is expected to approximate million 
during  we recorded charges of million for asset impairments  million for impairment on investments and million for restructuring and other charges 
activity and liability balances related to the restructuring and other charges for the years ended december  and are as follows in millions lease workforce related reductions total year ended december  restructuring and other expenses deductions december  restructuring balance year ended december  restructuring and other expenses deductions december  restructuring balance goodwill impairment charge 
during  we monitored fiber market conditions in light of additional job cuts and difficult prospects announced by several of our end market customers 
in view of these weaker market conditions during the third quarter of  we evaluated our goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment 
as a result of that evaluation  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
also see cumulative effect of accounting change below 
there was no impairment of goodwill in interest income 
interest income decreased to million during from million in the decrease was due to lower average invested funds and was compounded by lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in our interest expense arises from obligations under our convertible notes  issued on november  in september   we repurchased million in face value of the notes and consequently reduced the outstanding principal balance to million 
gain on repurchase of convertible notes 
during  we recognized a gain of million  on the repurchase of million in principal of our convertible notes  after adjusting for accrued interest and the write off of a proportionate share of unamortized offering costs 
provision benefit for income taxes 
in december  the company received a million refund pursuant to a carryback claim under the job creation and workers assistance tax act of the refund represented taxes paid in and cumulative effect of accounting change 
in  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the new rules  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization but is reviewed for potential impairment  upon adoption and thereafter annually or upon the occurrence of an impairment indicator 
the annual amortization of goodwill which would have approximated million was no longer required 
as a result of completing the required test  we recorded a charge for the cumulative effect of the accounting change in the amount of million representing the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit as compared to its estimated fair value 
in  there was no charge for an accounting change 
compared to net sales 
net sales during decreased to million  compared to million for improvement in our wireless business was more than offset by a downturn in demand in the broadband market 
specifically  net sales of integrated circuits for cellular and pcs applications increased during to million from million in the increase was due to our penetration into the cdma power amplifier module market more than offsetting the decrease in demand for tdma power amplifiers 
sales during of integrated circuits for broadband applications decreased to million from million in lower investment by telecom and cable providers led to declines in demand for our fiber and cable subscriber parts used primarily in set top boxes and cable modems 
the principal decrease was observed following the first quarter of when broadband revenues were million 
generally  selling prices for same product sales were lower during as compared to gross margin loss 
gross margin loss for increased to of net sales  compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the improvement in gross margin from the prior year is the result of lower inventory obsolescence charges down million and lower warranty related cost 
the aforementioned lower pricing was largely offset by savings related to lower test  assembly and raw material costs 
research development 
company sponsored research and development expense decreased during to million from million during primarily due to headcount reductions from our restructurings and a narrower focus on our fiber related projects 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expense decreased to in from in purchased in process r d 
the company expensed purchased in process research and development costs of million as a result of the telcom acquisition on april  the charge represented the fair value of certain acquired research and development projects that were determined to have not reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses 
no acquisitions or in process r d applied for selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses decreased during to million from million in the decrease was primarily due to savings from administrative headcount reductions from our restructurings  the elimination of goodwill amortization and other expense reductions 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses decreased to in from in asset and investment impairment charges and restructuring and other charges 
during  we recorded charges of million for asset impairments  million for impairment on investments and million for restructuring and other charges 
the asset impairment charge related to the write off of certain manufacturing and research equipment  leasehold improvements  certain technology licenses that are no longer used in the ongoing activities of the business and process technology from the telcom acquisition following an evaluation of our carrying value against the related business cash flows 
the charge for impairment on investments was recorded on a private equity investment following an evaluation that indicated the carrying value of such investment exceeded its estimated fair market value 
the restructuring and other charges were for lease related costs and for severance and related benefit costs of workforce reductions 
the workforce reductions eliminated approximately positions throughout the company 
during  we recorded charges of million for asset impairments  million for impairment on investments and million for restructuring and other charges  primarily severance and related benefits costs of workforce reductions  with million of benefits paid through december   and the remainder paid out in activity and liability balances related to the restructuring and other charges for the year ended december  were as follows in millions lease workforce related reductions total year ended december  restructuring and other expenses deductions december  restructuring balance goodwill impairment charge 
during  we monitored fiber market conditions in light of additional job cuts and difficult prospects announced by several of our end market customers 
in view of these weaker market conditions during the third quarter of  we evaluated our goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment 
as a result of that evaluation  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
also see cumulative effect of accounting change below 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million during from million in the decrease was due to generally lower interest rates  despite an increase in average invested funds 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the interest applies on our convertible notes  issued on november  in september   we repurchased million in face value of the notes  consequently reducing the outstanding balance to million 
gain on repurchase of convertible notes 
during  we recognized a gain of million  on the repurchase of million in principal amount of our convertible notes  after adjusting for accrued interest and the write off of a proportionate share of unamortized offering costs 
provision benefit for income taxes 
in december  the company received a million refund pursuant to a carryback claim under the job creation and workers assistance tax act of the refund represented taxes paid in and during  the company recorded a valuation allowance of million against the carrying value of its deferred tax asset 
since realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the timing and magnitude of future taxable income prior to the expiration of the deferred tax attributes  management recorded a full valuation allowance in and cumulative effect of accounting change 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the new rules  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization but is reviewed for potential impairment  upon adoption and thereafter annually or upon the occurrence of an impairment indicator 
the annual amortization of goodwill which would have approximated million was no longer required 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
as a result of completing the required test  in we recorded a charge for the cumulative effect of the accounting change in the amount of million representing the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit as compared to its estimated fair value 
liquidity and sources of capital at december  we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and million in marketable securities 
we had million of convertible notes outstanding as of december  operations required the use of million in cash during investing activities provided million of cash during  consisting principally of net sales of marketable securities of million  partially offset by purchases of equipment of million and the acquisitions of rfs and tavanza for million 
financing activities consisting of proceeds received from the employee stock purchase plan esp plan provided million of cash in at december   we had purchase commitments of approximately million for equipment  furniture  and leasehold improvements for the first half of we believe that our existing sources of capital  including our existing cash and marketable securities  will be adequate to satisfy operational needs and anticipated capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond 
our anticipated capital needs may include acquisitions of complimentary businesses or technologies  investments in other companies or repurchasing our outstanding debt or equity 
however  we may elect to finance all or part of our future capital requirements through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available on satisfactory terms

 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
fas requires that asset retirement obligations that are identifiable upon acquisition and construction  and during the operating life of a long lived asset be recorded as a liability using the present value of the estimated cash flows 
a corresponding amount would be capitalized as part of the asset s carrying amount and amortized to expense over the asset s useful life 
we adopted the provisions of fas effective january  and there was no impact on the financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas which nullifies eitf issue no 
fas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  whereas eitf no 
had recognized the liability at the commitment date to an exit plan 
the company adopted the provisions of fas for exit or disposal activities initiated after january  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin is the interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
consolidated financial statements  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
fin is effective immediately for all variable interest entities created after january  and effective for periods ending after march  for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the adoption of fin did not  nor is expected to  have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in certain available for sale securities 
our available for sale securities consist primarily of fixed income investments corporate bonds  commercial paper and us treasury and agency securities 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and credit ratings of issuers with respect to our available for sale securities 
accordingly  we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates and credit ratings of issuers are limited and would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  it is possible that we are at risk if interest rates or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
at december   we held marketable securities with an estimated fair value of million 
our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short term interest rates 
we do not purchase financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the following table provides information about our marketable securities at december  estimated principal amount and weighted average stated fair rate by expected maturity value value s total s principal      weighted average stated rates our convertible notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 
a change in interest rates on long term debt is assumed to impact fair value but not earnings or cash flow because the interest rate is fixed 
at december   the fair value of the outstanding convertible notes  estimated based upon dealer quotes  was approximately million 
the stated rates of interest expressed in the above table may not approximate the actual yield of the securities which we currently hold since we have purchased some of our marketable securities at other than face value 
additionally  some of the securities represented in the above table may be called or redeemed  at the option of the issuer  prior to their expected due dates 
if such early redemptions occur  we may reinvest the proceeds realized on such calls or redemptions in marketable securities with stated rates of interest or yields that are lower than those of current holdings  affecting both future cash interest streams and future earnings 
in addition to investments in marketable securities  we place some of our cash in money market funds in order to keep cash available to fund operations and to hold cash pending investments in marketable securities 
fluctuations in short term interest rates will affect the yield on monies invested in such money market funds 
such fluctuations can have an impact on our future cash interest streams and future earnings  but the impact of such fluctuations are not expected to be material
