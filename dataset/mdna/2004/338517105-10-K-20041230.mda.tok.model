during fiscal year  operating costs and expenses are expected to continue increasing primarily due to the restaurant in stuart  florida being open for the entire year  the opening of the new restaurant in wellington  florida at the start of the third quarter of fiscal year and the new package liquor store in hollywood  florida being open for the entire fiscal year 
the opening of the new restaurant in pinecrest  florida  or even the preparation for opening of the same for business by the end of fiscal year  will increase operating costs and expenses for the fiscal year 
overall  operating costs and expenses for existing stores are also expected to continue increasing slightly 
payroll and related costs were  for fiscal  as compared to  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
payroll and related costs for the fiscal increased as compared to payroll and related costs for fiscal and  primarily due to the opening of the new restaurant in stuart  florida on january   the opening of the new package store in hollywood  florida on november  and the restaurant in weston  florida being open for the entire fiscal occupancy costs  which include rent  common area maintenance  repairs and taxes were  for the fiscal as compared to  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in occupancy costs during the fiscal was due primarily to the payment of rent for the restaurant in weston  florida for the entire fiscal year  the payment of rent for the new restaurant in stuart  florida and the payment of rent for a new restaurant location in pinecrest  florida commencing at the start of the second quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal as compared to  and  for fiscal and  respectively

past due real property taxes  total  new joint venture restaurants as the company opens new joint venture restaurants on a more regular basis  the company s income from operations will be adversely effected by the higher costs associated with the opening of the same 
to insure that a new restaurant opens with the high quality of service for which the company is known  the company has a select group of employees  known as new restaurant openers  who travel to new restaurants for that purpose 
new restaurant openers may spend up to days at a new restaurant 
in the case of the new joint venture restaurant in stuart  florida  lodging had to be provided for the new restaurant openers  which increased the opening cost significantly over the opening cost of local restaurants 
in addition  immediately prior to the opening of a new restaurant and in order to provide a test run for the same  the company sponsors pre opening parties for its joint venture investors and the company employees 
by way of illustration  the opening of the last two joint venture restaurants in stuart  florida and weston  florida incurred the following pre opening and opening expenses stuart  fl 
weston  fl 
pre opening rent   pre opening payroll   post opening increased   payroll costs days promotional costs   total   excludes lodging and per diem allowances   for new restaurant openers incurred due to the proximity of this location 
the pre opening rent is generally less for new leases  rather than the purchase of an existing location which includes the assumption of an existing lease 
in the negotiation of a new lease  there is normally a construction period before which the rent begins 
in the case of the joint venture restaurant in stuart  florida  the sublease agreement included a ninety day period for renovations  although the restaurant did not open for six and one half months from the execution of the sublease agreement 
the sublease agreement for the location in weston  florida provided for five months for renovations before rent began  although the commencement date of the sublease agreement was delayed while licensing matters had to be resolved 
since the opening of the joint venture restaurant in surfside  florida  the pre opening rent expense for joint venture restaurants has ranged from   the pre opening rent expense for the new joint venture restaurant in pinecrest  florida has already proven to be an exception to the customary pre opening rent expense due to structural repairs which must be made to the business premises prior to renovations beginning 
as of october   pre opening rent was  and continuing at  per month 
the company has preserved its right to argue with the landlord that some of the pre opening rent is not due while structural repairs have delayed its renovations 
during fiscal  the joint venture in stuart  florida reported a loss of  and the joint venture restaurant in pinecrest  florida  which is still undergoing structural repairs at this time  has already reported a loss of  thus contributing to the reduction in operating income for fiscal when compared to fiscal during fiscal year  operating income will be adversely affected by the opening costs to be incurred for the new joint venture restaurant in wellington  florida  and continuing opening costs of the new joint venture restaurant in pinecrest  florida

as a result  other income and expense of fiscal includes the expense of  relating to the abandonment of fixed assets 
other income and expenses for fiscal includes the gain of  on disposition relating to the eminent domain proceedings 
trends during the next twelve months management expects continued increases in restaurant sales  due primarily to the restaurant in stuart  florida being open for the entire fiscal year  the opening of the new restaurant in wellington  florida  and continued increases in same store sales 
the opening of the new restaurant in pinecrest  florida for business prior to the end of fiscal year will further increase restaurant sales 
package goods sales are also expected to increase due primarily to the new package store in hollywood  florida being open for the entire fiscal year and continued increases in same store sales 
franchise royalties are expected to increase due to restaurant in stuart  florida being open for the entire fiscal year  the opening of the new restaurant in wellington  florida and continued increases in same store sales for the limited partnerships and franchises 
the opening of the new restaurant in pinecrest  florida prior to the end of fiscal year will further increase franchise royalties 
at the same time  management also expects higher food costs and overall expenses to increase generally  although the company has already raised some of its menu prices to offset the higher food costs and will continue to do so wherever competitively possible 
the company intends to open additional restaurants as suitable locations become available  using limited partnerships  of which it is the general partner  to raise funds to own and operate the same 
the company does not plan to construct any more buildings for the operation of a package store and is not actively searching for locations  but if an appropriate location for a package store becomes available  the company will consider the same

sept 
current assets    current liabilities    working capital    working capital for fiscal increased by from the working capital for fiscal and decreased by from the working capital for fiscal the increase in working capital from the working capital for fiscal is due to the fact that the construction of the building in hollywood  florida from which the company operates a package liquor store was substantially completed by the end of fiscal the company currently has no plans to construct another building for the purpose of operating a package liquor store 
the increase in working capital would have been greater had the company not advanced funds for capital improvements and on going expenses for the restaurant in pinecrest  florida  
during fiscal year and the completion of the private offering by the limited partnership owning the restaurant in pinecrest  florida  the company will be reimbursed for advances made in excess of its investment  investment at a minimum  thereby improving working capital 
management believes that positive cash flow from operations will adequately fund operations  debt reductions and planned capital expenditures in fiscal year however  it is also anticipated that during fiscal year  working capital will be adversely affected by the annual dividend  investments and or advances made by the company to limited partnership in pinecrest  florida pending reimbursement of advances made by the company in excess of its investment once the private offering by the limited partnership is completed and the exercise by the company of its option to purchase the real property and ground lease of one location currently leased by the company 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements estimated useful lives of property and equipment the estimate of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates 
expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material 
in addition 
periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material 
management estimates the useful life of those assets by considering  among other things  expected use  life of the lease on the building  and warranty period  if applicable 
the assets are then depreciated using a straight line method over those estimated lives 
these estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary 
any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary 
in fiscal  management reviewed the estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements and recorded an adjustment which was not significant 
consolidation of limited partnerships the company operates restaurants as general partner for the limited partnership that owns the operations of these restaurants 
the company refers to these entities as joint ventures or limited partnerships 
additionally  the company expects that any expansion which takes place in opening new restaurants will also result in the company operating the restaurants as general partner 
in addition to the general partnership interest the company also purchases limited partnership units ranging from to of the total units outstanding 
as a result of these controlling interests  the company consolidates the operations of these limited partnerships with those of the company despite the fact the company does not own in excess of of the equity interests 
all intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
the minority interests in the earnings of these joint ventures are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share 
income taxes financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes requires  among other things  recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss and tip credit carryforwards to the extent that realization of said benefits is more likely than not 
for discussion regarding the company s carryforwards refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal other matters impact of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had any material effect during the past three fiscal years 
to the extent allowed by competition  the company recovers increased costs by increasing prices 
item a 
quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not ordinarily hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes  but as of october  holds one equity security  at a cost of  for dividend payments 
even if the price of the equity securities decreased by below its cost  results of operations would be reduced by  an amount management considers immaterial 
interest rate risk at october   the company has no risk from interest rate exposure 
the company has only one debt arrangement which has a variable interest rate 
for this instrument  a mortgage note  the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk 
the mortgage note has an outstanding principal balance at october  of  the other debt instrument which had a variable interest rate was satisfied in full during the fourth quarter of fiscal year subsequent to the end of fiscal year  the company closed on a new unsecured loan from bankatlantic  in the principal amount of  which funds are to be used in connection with the company s exercise of an option to purchase the real property and take an assignment of a ground lease at one of its locations 
the promissory note has a variable interest  at prime 
but even if interest rates increased by  results of operations would be reduced by less than  an amount management considers immaterial 
at october   the company s cash resources earn interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s return on these funds is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
any decrease in interest rates will have a negative effect on the company s earnings 
in addition  the company incurs interest charges on debt at variable rates  which to the extent that the company has not entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge this risk  could negatively impact the company s earnings 
there is no assurance that interest rates will increase or decrease over the next fiscal year
