the company s long term debt has maintained a rating of aa by standard poor s and aa by moody s investors service 
the company currently issues commercial paper in the us  canadian and european markets

these borrowings carry a standard poor s rating of a and a moody s rating of p the commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable of are classified as long term debt at december   as the company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis  including  if necessary  utilizing its lines of credit that expire in certain of the company s financing arrangements require the maintenance of a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to debt 
the esop notes guaranteed by the company and certain amounts payable to banks contain cross default provisions 
noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed 
the company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote 
in  the company formed a financing subsidiary with outside equity investors that purchases some of the company s receivables 
the company consolidates this entity  including such receivables  and reports the 
table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts amounts invested by outside investors as a minority interest

the company defines free cash flow before dividends as net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures 
as management uses this measure to evaluate the company s ability to satisfy current and future obligations  repurchase stock  pay dividends and fund future business opportunities  the company believes that it provides useful information to investors 
free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the company has certain nondiscretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure 
free cash flow before dividends is not a gaap measurement and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
a reconciliation of net cash provided by operations to free cash flow before dividends follows net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures free cash flow before dividends the company has additional sources of liquidity available in the form of lines of credit maintained with various banks and access to financial markets worldwide

the transaction is structured as an all cash acquisition of between to of the outstanding shares of gaba for an aggregate price ranging from million swiss francs to  million swiss francs approximately to based on december  exchange rates  depending on the number of shares acquired and subject to a purchase price adjustment 
it is expected that substantially all the outstanding shares will be acquired by the company 
the acquisition is subject 
table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts to regulatory approvals in several european countries and other customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed within the next three to five months 
the pending acquisition of gaba will be funded using a combination of debt  primarily short term  and available cash balances with the majority anticipated to be repaid within months of the closing of the acquisition 
the portion of long term debt  if any  will depend upon future market conditions and other factors 
in connection with the financing of the gaba acquisition  the company anticipates that the amount of its common stock repurchases during will decline as compared with levels

it is anticipated that the ongoing impact from the divestment of the non core european detergents and soap brands combined with the effects of these restructuring activities will not result in a material impact on future earnings 
additionally  the company continues to assess the further regionalization of manufacturing facilities to reduce costs and to streamline its operations 
costs for these restructuring activities are reflected in the consolidated statements of income in other income expense  net primarily in the corporate segment as these decisions are corporate driven and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance 
managing foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price exposure the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity price fluctuations 
volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a consolidated basis by utilizing a number of techniques  including working capital management  selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument transactions in accordance with the company s treasury and risk management policies 
the company s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes 
with operations in over countries and territories  the company is exposed to currency fluctuation related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar 
the major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in the european union and certain latin american countries  although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the us dollar 
the company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets and has been able to substantially offset the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of cost containment measures  selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs 
the company primarily utilizes currency forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business 
from time to time  the company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency purchases using forward contracts with durations no greater than months 
interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the company s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility 
the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production 
futures contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases 
the results of the company s commodity hedging activities are not material 

table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the company  however  nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the company s policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long term debt rating of aa aa or higher 
value at risk the company s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows  market value and sensitivity analysis 
however  the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
market exposures are evaluated using a value at risk var model and an earnings at risk ear model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments  assuming adverse market conditions occur  given a confidence level 
the models utilize a variance covariance modeling technique 
historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates from the preceding year are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments  calculated using the var model  is not material to the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company in and the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments  calculated utilizing the ear model  is not material to the company s results of operations in and actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets

refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates 
the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed 
actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management 
the company s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
in certain instances  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods 
the company s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options  shipping and handling costs  and inventories 
two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available  the intrinsic value method and the fair value method 
the company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  and accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized 
under the fair value method  the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and future volatility 
if the fair value method were used  diluted earnings per share for would decrease approximately 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company reports such costs  primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight  in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  the company s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales 
if such costs were included in cost of sales  gross profit margin as a percent to sales would decrease from to in with no impact on reported earnings 
the company accounts for inventories using both the first in  first out fifo method of inventories and the last in  first out lifo method of inventories 
there would be no impact on reported earnings for  and if all inventories were accounted for under the fifo method 
the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits  asset impairment  tax valuation allowances  and legal and other contingencies 
in pension accounting  the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate for domestic plans was  and as of december   and  respectively 
as required  the discount rate is based upon published year end rates on high quality bonds 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for domestic plans was  and as of december   and  respectively 
in determining the long term rate of return  the company considers the nature of the plans investments  an expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rates of return 
a change in either the discount rate or the assumed return on plan assets would impact net income by approximately a third  less significant assumption is the long term rate of compensation increase  a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long term rate of return 
this rate was  and as of december   and  respectively 
the most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate 
in  the assumed rate of increase was for and declining per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of per year 
the effect of a increase in the assumed long term medical cost trend rate would reduce net income by approximately asset impairment analysis is primarily performed for intangible assets and requires several estimates including future cash flows  growth rates and the selection of a discount rate 
since the estimated fair 
table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts value of the company s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value  significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge 
tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets  such as tax loss carryforwards  to net realizable value 
factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction  carryforward periods  income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income 
a significant change to the company s valuation allowances would primarily impact equity and would not materially impact reported earnings 
legal and other contingency reserves are based on management s assessment of the risk of potential loss  which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors 
such assessments are reviewed each period and revised  based on current facts and circumstances  if necessary 
it is management s opinion that the ultimate disposition of these matters  to the extent not previously provided for  will not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or ongoing cash flows 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s contingencies 
the company generates revenue through the sale of well known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms 
while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates  there is a short time frame typically less than days between the shipment of product and cash receipt  thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company s significant accounting policies 
outlook looking forward into  the company is well positioned for continued growth in most of its markets 
however  the company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration in many markets 
in addition  movements in foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in us dollars 
in particular  economic uncertainty in some countries in latin america and changes in the value of the euro may impact the overall results of latin america and europe 
the company expects the continued success of colgate toothpaste  using patented and proprietary technology  to bolster worldwide oral care leadership and expects new products in oral care and other categories to add potential for further growth 
overall  subject to global economic conditions  the company does not expect the market conditions to be materially different from those experienced in and the company expects its positive momentum to continue 
historically  the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries 
therefore  the company constantly evaluates projects that will focus operations on opportunities for enhanced growth potential 
over the long term  colgate s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names  its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets  and its strong capital base all position the company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to continue to increase profitability and shareholder value
