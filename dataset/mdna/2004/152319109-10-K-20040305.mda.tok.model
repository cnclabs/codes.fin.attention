industry environment over the past two decades  communications technology has evolved from simple analog voice signals transmitted over networks of copper telephone lines to complex analog and digital voice and data signals transmitted over networks of media  such as copper wires  fiber optic strands and wireless transmission over radio frequencies 
this evolution has been driven by substantial increases in the number of users and new data intensive computing and communications applications  such as web based commerce  streaming audio and video and telecommuting 
in addition  information is increasingly available via wired and wireless networks through a 
table of contents variety of access devices  including personal computers and handheld computing devices such as personal digital assistants  portable digital audio players  digital cameras and cellular phones 
these applications and devices are continuing to require higher and more cost efficient data transfer rates throughout the network communications infrastructures that serve them 
this evolution has inspired equipment manufacturers and service providers to develop and expand existing broadband communications markets and has created the need for new generations of integrated circuits 
broadband transmission of digital information over existing infrastructure requires highly integrated mixed signal semiconductor products to perform critical systems functions such as complex signal processing and converting digital data to and from analog signals 
broadband communications equipment requires substantially higher levels of system performance  in terms of both speed and precision  which typically cannot be adequately addressed by traditional semiconductor products developed for low speed transmission applications 
moreover  products that are based on multiple discrete analog and digital chipsets generally cannot achieve the cost effectiveness  performance and reliability requirements demanded by today s broadband marketplace 
these requirements are best addressed by new generations of highly integrated mixed signal and digital devices that combine complex system functions within high performance circuitry and can be manufactured in high volumes using cost effective process technologies 
strategy our objective is to be a leading provider of semiconductor products for equipment manufacturers serving the broadband communications markets 
key elements of our strategy include the following grow and diversify the company by leveraging our technical expertise to target complementary  high growth broadband communications markets 
our strategy is to focus on complementary  high growth broadband communications markets and to develop products for applications in those markets 
our current products are designed for the dsl central office co infrastructure equipment  dsl customer premises equipment cpe and vop equipment markets 
additionally  we are developing technologies for the optical access market and plan to introduce products for this market in by targeting complementary markets which share common technologies and customers  we are able to more effectively utilize our existing engineering  sales and marketing resources 
extend technology leadership 
we have invested substantial resources to establish our technology leadership 
we believe we were the first company to deliver integrated asymmetric digital subscriber line adsl infrastructure products for the central office that support multiple ports 
we also believe we are the first company to deliver an adsl technology that enables transmission at rates of up to megabits per second mbps 
we call this technology extremedsl max and this megabit technology compares to the predominant worldwide adsl technology standard which provides up to only mbps 
furthermore  we believe we are one of the first companies able to provide products that support the new worldwide adsl adsl standard which enables higher speed data transmission for consumers and businesses and allows more efficient network management for dsl service providers 
an important element of our technological leadership is our programmable digital signal processor and associated processing instructions  or algorithms  which are optimized for high bandwidth communications applications 
this core technology can be extended to develop multiple communications products for complementary markets 
we intend to continue to invest our resources to extend our technology lead in our current target markets and to leverage this lead to enter complementary broadband communications markets 
accelerate the geographic diversification of our existing businesses 
in  revenues from customers outside of japan grew to million from million in this growth was due primarily to significant improvements in revenues from customers in north america  taiwan and china 
however  in spite of the significant growth in revenues from customers outside of japan in  our dsl customers in japan still accounted for of our revenues 
as part of our strategy to accelerate the geographic diversification of our dsl business  in we plan to significantly increase our investment in the company s sales and 
table of contents marketing team outside of japan 
our goal is to use these increased sales and marketing resources to increase market share by more quickly converting existing design wins into greater revenue and to secure more design wins at key dsl and vop equipment manufacturers 
leverage system level expertise 
many of our system level engineers have previous experience as employees of communications equipment manufacturers and are therefore very familiar with the requirements of  and challenges faced by  our customers 
we combine this system level engineering expertise with our expertise in integrated circuit  digital signal processor and software design to develop products that allow our customers to optimize time to market  performance and systems cost 
pursue strategic acquisitions 
our strategy is to enhance our growth capability by pursuing selective acquisitions 
this strategy allows us to more rapidly obtain complementary technologies and engineering talent and to access key markets and customer relationships 
in  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission which allows us to raise up to million dollars of additional capital through the issuance of registered securities 
we believe that having the shelf registration statement in place can significantly improve our ability to obtain financing for general purposes and working capital requirements and or fund possible investments in acquisitions of complimentary businesses  partnerships  minority investments  products or technologies 
we believe completing selective acquisitions will be important to remaining competitive as a complete product solutions provider to manufacturers of broadband communications equipment 
target markets and centillium products we design  develop and supply a portfolio of products for a number of the key applications enabling broadband communications 
currently  our core markets include dsl co infrastructure products for use in the service provider s central office  dsl cpe products for use in a dsl subscriber s home or business and vop products for use in carrier and enterprise class voice gateways and switches 
we are developing products which further expand our dsl and vop product lines  and we are also developing a family of optical access products initially targeting the emerging opportunity for optical infrastructure in the fiber to the premises fttp market  which we will introduce in digital subscriber line dsl digital subscriber line technologies  commonly known as dsl  represent a family of broadband technologies that use a greater range of frequencies of existing copper telephone lines than traditional telephone services which in turn allows greater bandwidth to send and receive information 
dsl speeds range from kbps up to mbps depending on the distance between the central office and subscriber 
these data rates enable dsl service providers to offer a wide range of new bundled broadband services 
dsl continues to be a rapidly growing market that is driving demand for increasing amounts of semiconductor integrated circuits 
according to the dell oro group  the number of worldwide dsl subscribers grew from less than million at the end to million at the end of and is projected to reach million by the end of our dsl products are based on a type of dsl technology known as asymmetrical dsl or adsl 
adsl technology provides substantially faster transmission of data from the network to the end user than from the end user to the network 
this tradeoff works to the consumer s advantage in that most users typically download more data from the network than they send to the network 
each of our dsl products consists primarily of two semiconductor devices a mixed signal device and a digital device 
the mixed signal chip translates signals between analog and digital formats  and our digital chip incorporates our proprietary software programmable digital signal processor 
dsl central office co infrastructure products our maximus and copperflite families of dsl infrastructure products are used in various types of communications equipment that aggregate and process data traffic from a substantial number of individual 
table of contents telephone lines for transmission through a data network 
our high performance  tightly integrated infrastructure chipsets offer high port density coupled with low power consumption 
high port density means that a service provider can serve more customers with fewer pieces of equipment  while a low power chipset leads to lower energy and operational costs for the service provider 
these features effectively lower costs for service providers 
dsl customer premises equipment cpe products our palladia family of products is used in various types of customer premises equipment that process data signals between a regular telephone line and a computer 
it enables end users to simultaneously connect to the internet at very high data rates while talking on the telephone or sending a fax 
our high performance dsl cpe chipsets enable cpe equipment manufacturers to produce devices with high data throughput 
in addition  the integration of various features  small form factor and low power consumption of our palladia chipsets result in lower production and ownership costs 
voice over packet the increased demand from service providers and enterprises to deliver voice and data communications over a single integrated network has accelerated the trend towards the use of vop technology 
this technology provides the most bandwidth efficient method of transmitting voice information in discrete packets over the traditional circuit based infrastructure of the public switched telephone network 
the convergence of voice and data traffic over internet networks delivered from a single multi service network offers a major benefit through this simplified network solution 
currently  most telephony service providers maintain two separate networks one for legacy voice traffic and a second for data traffic 
vop technology compresses voice signals into discrete packets of data  thereby enabling the voice signals to be transmitted over lower cost networks originally designed for data only transmission 
vop technology is used in numerous new types of communications equipment  such as next generation carrier and enterprise class gateways and soft switches  digital loop carriers and ip dsl access multiplexers  and media terminal adapters and home gateways for use by consumers and small businesses 
these vop technology based devices enable more efficient and cost effective voice transmissions than their legacy circuit switched equipment counterparts 
in addition to significant cost savings  vop also enables advanced services that traditional telephony could not support 
vop technology enables and enhances features such as unified messaging and managed services that provide additional value to consumers and businesses and allow service providers to enhance revenue opportunities 
voice over packet products we currently provide three products for the vop market entropia iii  entropia ii lp and entropia ii eg 
entropia iii is our fourth generation vop product and can process up to  voice channels per chip supporting voice over internet protocol voip and voice over atm functionality 
entropia iii is sold to manufacturers of broadband infrastructure products for use in central office based voice switching equipment such as trunking  access  and media gateways 
entropia ii lp is our third generation vop product and processes up to voice channels per chip 
entropia ii lp is marketed for use in central office and enterprise voice equipment that requires mid level channel densities and central office equipment that processes both dsl and voip signals 
entropia ii eg is our third generation vop product that processes up to voice channels per chip 
entropia ii ep is marketed for use in central office access gateways and enterprise voice equipment that requires lower channel densities 
fiber to the premises fttp like dsl  fttp technologies provide high speed network access for both residential and business end users 
fttp offers speeds of service up to gbps without the limitations of distance or the symmetry asymmetry profiles typical in dsl 
in addition  fttp also has the potential to virtually eliminate the cost of an entire class 
table of contents of equipment in the provider s network the outside plant electronics 
this optical broadband infrastructure enables fttp service providers to offer a wider range of next generation bundled services to potentially enhance their revenue streams 
fttp is still in its infancy and has a history of prolonged and painful introduction  but it is now a rapidly growing market in selected networks  which is driving demand for increasing amounts of semiconductor integrated circuits 
the number of worldwide fttp subscribers is growing at a fast pace  mainly fueled by growth in japan and the united states markets 
in japan alone  the number of fttp subscribers is approaching million users  and it is anticipated to double over the next fiscal year 
our fttp products are based on a type of optical technology known as passive optical networking pon 
in this market space  we plan to introduce ethernet based pon epon products 
each of our fttp products consists of one or two semiconductor devices either working independently or jointly a mixed signal device known as a protocol chipset and an analog device known as a transceiver 
the mixed signal chip translates signals between analog and digital formats  and our analog chip incorporates innovative technologies to bring photonic signals into the protocol device 
planned introduction of fttp products in  we plan to introduce four classes of products for the fttp market central office co transceivers  co protocol processors  customer premise equipment cpe transceivers and cpe protocol processors 
transceivers are used to convert light signals contained in individual strands of optical fiber into electrical signals suitable for higher level data processing 
protocol processors pick up the data stream from a transceiver and manage the bi directional flow of information for delivery to an end user 
end users may then use these streams of data to access the internet over high speed circuits or connect voice devices vop or traditional analog telephones  as well as receive video broadcasts 
our co solutions will be characterized by high performance  high density and low power consumption  while our cpe solutions will showcase advanced integration of functions targeting cost and ease of design 
technology our primary competitive advantage is technology expertise in key areas including our system level knowledge  programmable digital signal processor  signal processing algorithms  digital chip design capability  mixed signal chip design capability and system level software 
together  these capabilities have enabled us to provide system level communications products that have flexibility due to programmability  higher data throughput  low power consumption  and small size 
software programmable digital signal processor 
a cornerstone of our technology is our internally developed software programmable digital signal processor 
a digital signal processor  as it relates to communications applications  encodes digital data for transmission over bandwidth limited media  such as copper telephone lines  and recovers the encoded data at the receiving end 
our software programmable digital signal processor is optimized for communications applications and provides high processing bandwidth with low power requirements 
this digital signal processor can be programmed for several different applications  such as dsl and vop networking 
this software programmable digital signal processor technology gives us the advantage of field programmability of devices 
field programmability means that service providers can remotely upgrade their equipment to address new standards or enable improved features  thereby extending the life cycles of their equipment while incurring lower costs 

table of contents signal processing algorithms 
a key component of our continued success is the expertise that we have developed in communications algorithms 
communications algorithms are the processes and techniques used to transform a digital data stream into a specially conditioned analog signal suitable for transmission across copper telephone wires 
we possess a thorough understanding of  and practical experience in  the process of transmitting and receiving a digital data stream in analog form 
we also have significant experience developing algorithms to enable voice compression  echo cancellation and telephony signal processing 
this expertise allows us to design highly efficient algorithms that in turn enable us to create products with high performance  re programmability and low power consumption 
digital chip design 
we are experts in the area of highly complex  high speed digital chip development 
we perform both the logic design and the physical layout design for our products 
this design expertise has enabled us to develop tightly integrated digital chips that have small form factors and consume low power 
mixed signal chip design 
a mixed signal chip translates signals between analog and digital formats 
our team of analog engineers has substantial experience in signal conversion techniques and analog circuit design  and we believe our mixed signal dsl chip contains among the highest level of integration in the industry 
system software 
we have expertise in developing software that addresses the needs of network equipment manufacturers and service providers 
our knowledge of network operation and architectures allows us to write software that ensures that our products are interoperable with communications equipment vendors products 
in addition  our understanding of various operating systems and personal computer environments allows us to create software that provides for simple installation and operation 
customers and strategic relationships we sell our products to leading manufacturers of broadband communications equipment in our target markets 
because we leverage our technologies across different markets  certain of our integrated circuits may be incorporated into equipment used in different markets 
as part of our business strategy  we periodically establish strategic relationships with certain key customers 
from time to time  we have also entered into development agreements with certain key customers to co develop products 
a small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue 
sales to nec represented approximately of our net revenue in and approximately of our net revenue in sales to sumitomo electric industries represented approximately of our net revenue in and approximately of our net revenue in the loss of a key customer could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect that our key customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and in the foreseeable future 
these customers and their respective contributions to our net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders that customers can generally cancel or defer on short notice and do not have agreements with any of our key customers that contain long term commitments to purchase specified volumes of our products 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing strategy is to achieve design wins with technology leaders in each of our targeted broadband communications markets by  among other things  providing superior design in engineering support 
we believe that providing comprehensive design in service and support is critical to shortening our customers design cycles and maintaining a competitive position in our targeted markets 
we market and sell our products through our direct sales force and through independent sales representatives 
our sales managers are dedicated to our principal customers to promote close cooperation and communication 
representatives support the sales 
table of contents managers by providing leads  nurturing customer relationships  closing design wins and securing customer orders 
we manage a number of marketing programs designed to communicate our capabilities and benefits to broadband access equipment manufacturers 
our web site is an important marketing tool where a wide range of information is available  including product information  white papers  application notes  press releases and contributed articles 
in addition  we participate in industry trade shows  technical conferences and technology seminars  conduct press tours and publish technical articles in industry journals 
backlog in many cases we manufacture our products in advance of receiving firm product orders from our customers based upon our forecasts of worldwide customer demand 
our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products 
due to industry practice  which allows customers to cancel or change orders prior to shipment  we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenue levels 
all backlog orders can be filled within the next fiscal year 
research and development we have assembled a core team of experienced engineers and technologists  many of whom are leaders in their particular field or discipline 
as of december   we employed engineers in research and development 
these employees are involved in advancing our core technologies  as well as applying these core technologies to product development activities in our target markets 
we believe that the achievement of higher levels of integration  functionality and performance and the introduction of new products in our target markets are essential to our growth 
our current plans are to increase our research and development staffing levels in in addition to our principal design facilities in fremont  california  we also have design centers in india and france 
research and development expense for  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
operations and manufacturing we outsource the fabrication  assembly and testing of our semiconductor devices 
this fabless model allows us to focus our resources on the design  development and marketing of our products 
we manage the production of our devices through our operations and manufacturing group  which consists of technology engineering  test engineering  logistics  quality assurance and reliability 
wafer fabrication we source our semiconductor fabrication from some of the world s largest foundries  including but not limited to  our principal suppliers taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  united microelectronics corporation and semiconductor manufacturing international corporation 
our manufacturing strategy is to qualify and utilize multiple facilities within a given foundry partner for the fabrication of a given semiconductor integrated circuit 
this second source strategy seeks to ensure production and performance consistency  both of which are critical for our products  while maintaining multiple channels of supply 
any inability of one of our independent foundry subcontractors to provide the necessary capacity or output for our products could result in significant production delays and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we currently believe we have adequate capacity to support our current sales levels  we continue to work with our existing foundries to assure production capacity  and we intend to qualify new foundries to provide additional production capacity 
it is possible that adequate foundry capacity may not be 
table of contents available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event a foundry experiences financial difficulties  or if a foundry suffers any damage or destruction to its facilities  or in the event of any other disruption of foundry capacity  we may not be able to qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new products in a timely manner 
assembly and test foundry subcontractors conduct our silicon wafer testing 
following completion of the silicon wafer tests  the dies are assembled into packages and the finished semiconductor products are tested by one of our four key subcontractors advanced semiconductor engineering  amkor technology  st assembly test services  and united test and assembly center ltd 
while we have not experienced any material disruption in supply from assembly subcontractors to date  we could experience assembly problems in the future 
the availability of assembly and testing services from these subcontractors could be materially and adversely affected in the event a subcontractor experiences financial difficulties  if a subcontractor suffers any damage or destruction to its respective facilities  or in the event of any other disruption of assembly and testing capacity 
quality assurance manufacturers of broadband communications equipment demand high quality and reliable semiconductors for incorporation into their products 
we focus on product reliability from the initial stage of the design cycle through each specific design process  including layout and production test design 
in addition  we subject our designs to in depth circuit simulation at temperature  voltage and processing extremes before initiating the manufacturing process 
we prequalify our assembly and foundry subcontractors 
this prequalification process consists of a series of industry standard environmental product stress tests  as well as an audit and analysis of the subcontractor s quality system and manufacturing capability 
we also participate in quality and reliability monitoring through each stage of the production cycle by reviewing electrical and parametric data from our wafer foundry and assembly subcontractors 
we closely monitor wafer foundry production to ensure consistent overall quality  reliability and yield levels 
in cases where we purchase wafers on a fixed cost basis  any improvement in yields can reduce our cost per chip 
competition although we produce system level products  we primarily compete with vendors of semiconductor devices for the dsl and vop markets 
we believe that the principal factors of competition for semiconductor vendors to these markets are product capabilities  level of integration  rate of data throughput  performance and reliability  power consumption  price  time to market  system cost  intellectual property rights  customer support and reputation 
we believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
we compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of semiconductors for both dsl central office and customer premises equipment and with suppliers of semiconductors for equipment enabling vop networks 
our principal competitors that supply semiconductors to these markets include analog devices  broadcom  conexant systems  infineon  st microelectronics and texas instruments 
many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources 
as a result  our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
in addition  our 
table of contents competitors may in the future develop technologies that more effectively address our markets at a lower cost 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors  or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property law  nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our proprietary rights 
we also utilize unpatented proprietary know how and trade secrets and employ various methods to protect such intellectual property 
although we employ a variety of intellectual property in the development and manufacturing of our products  we believe that none of that intellectual property is individually critical to our current operations 
however  taken as a whole  we believe our intellectual property rights are significant and that the loss of all or a substantial portion of such rights could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot assure you that our intellectual property protection measures will be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
in addition  the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual properties to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
from time to time  third parties have or may assert infringement claims against us or against our customers in connection with their use of our products 
in addition  we may desire or be required to renew or to obtain licenses from others in order to further develop and market commercially viable products effectively 
we cannot assure you that any necessary licenses will be available on reasonable terms 
employees as of december   we had a total of employees  of whom are engineers 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union 
however  certain of our foreign employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements mandated by local country law 
we do not anticipate that the results of future negotiations under these collective bargaining agreements will have a material adverse financial impact on our business 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key personnel  none of whom is bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any definite period of time 
our future success also depends on our continued ability to attract  integrate  retain and motivate highly qualified sales  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for such qualified personnel is intense 
to date  we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees  but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future 
in fiscal  we intend to increase our overall workforce  primarily in research and development and sales and marketing  from the level of employees as of december  revenues by geographic area the following is a summary of net revenues by major geographic area in thousands years ended december  japan north america asia excluding japan all other total

critical accounting policies general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe that  of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following are critical accounting policies  which may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition 
revenues related to product sales are generally recognized when the products have been shipped and risk of loss has passed to the customer  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the price is fixed or determinable 
sales arrangements may contain customer specific acceptance requirements for both products and development revenues 
in such cases  revenue is deferred at the time of delivery of the product or service and is recognized upon receipt of customer acceptance 
sales returns and allowances 
we establish  upon shipment of our products  a provision for estimated returns 
under certain circumstances  we allow our customers to return products and a provision is made for such returns 
our estimate of product returns is based on contractual terms or sales agreements  historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
additional provisions and allowances may be required  resulting in decreased net revenue and gross profit  should we experience increased product returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based upon specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible 
we record additional allowances based on certain percentages of our aged receivables  which are determined based on historical experience and our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required 
we have a limited number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in one of those customers creditworthiness or other matters affecting the collectibility of amounts due from such customers could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost  or net realizable value 
cost is based on a first in  first out basis 
we perform detailed reviews of the net realizable value of inventories  both on hand as well as inventories that we are committed to purchase  with consideration given to deterioration  obsolescence and other factors 
we may record charges to write down inventories that are excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory based on an analysis of the impact of changes in technology  the timing of these changes and our estimate of forecasted demand for our products 
we typically use a six or nine month rolling forecast based on the type of products  anticipated product orders  product order history  forecasts and backlog 
we compare our current or committed inventory levels to these forecasts on a regular basis and any adverse changes to our future product demand may result in increased writedowns  resulting in decreased gross profit 
warranty 
a limited warranty is provided on our products for a period of one year and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty 
if actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required 
litigation and contingencies 
from time to time  we receive various inquiries or claims in connection with patent and other intellectual property rights 
in certain cases  we have accrued estimates of the amounts we expect to pay upon resolution of such matters 
should we not be able to secure the terms we expect  these estimates may change and may result in increased accruals  resulting in decreased profit

we are also developing a new line of broadband semiconductor products for optical access applications which we plan to introduce in to date  our revenues have been derived primarily from the sale of our dsl semiconductor products which include the copperflite co  copperflite cpe  palladia and maximus families of products and  to a small degree  our entropia vop semiconductor products 
we have generated a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to a limited number of customers 
for the year ended december   nec and sumitomo electric industries represented and of our revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   nec and sumitomo electric industries represented and of our revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   sumitomo electric industries and nec represented and of our revenues  respectively 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues in and for the foreseeable future 
during the years ended december    and   and of our revenues  respectively  were from customers in asia  primarily japan 
the absolute dollar amount of our revenues from customers in asia increased in compared to primarily due to the increased number of dsl subscriber additions in japan 
both our revenues and the percentage of revenues from our customers in north america increased in due to increases in spending in the communications equipment industry 
we currently sell through our direct sales force in china  france  japan  north america  south korea and taiwan 
we also utilize sales representatives in china  germany  hong kong  israel  italy  japan  north america  south korea and taiwan 
all of our revenues are denominated solely in us dollars  which reduces our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
it often takes more than one year for us to realize volume shipments of our products after we first contact a customer 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take six months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation of their systems and begin the marketing process  a period which typically lasts an additional three to six months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our sales efforts and our realization of revenues  if any  from volume purchases of our products by our customers 
our customers are not obligated by long term contracts to purchase our products and can generally cancel or reschedule orders on short notice 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur expenses for research and development  selling  general and administrative efforts and investments in inventory  and the generation of corresponding revenue  if any 
we anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to month 
if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our results of operations for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  could be materially and adversely affected 
we outsource the fabrication  assembly and testing of our products 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our manufacturing partners 
costs of revenues also encompass our internal manufacturing and operations functions and a portion of our information systems and facilities costs 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  prototype costs related to the fabrication of our silicon chips  depreciation associated with software development tools and amortization of deferred compensation 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures  the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability in our expenses 
for example  we require a substantial number of prototypes to build and test our complex products and therefore incur significant prototype costs 
research and development is key to our future success 
we anticipate that research and development expense may increase in both the near term and the long term as we incur additional costs related to the growth of our company 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales  customer service and applications engineering support functions  costs associated with promotional and other marketing expenses  as well as amortization of deferred compensation 
in addition  the complexity of our products and the applications support necessary for successful interoperability and customer specific applications requires highly trained customer service and support personnel 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expense will increase in the near term and long term as we add personnel to support our customers and expand our sales force outside of the japan market 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executives  finance  accounting  facilities  information services  human resources  recruiting expenses  legal and other professional fees  other corporate expenses  and amortization of deferred compensation 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include management s estimate of potential bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the near term and the long term as we incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and address the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
in connection with the grant of certain stock and other stock based compensation to our employees  technical advisors and directors  we have recorded stock based compensation expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
deferred compensation is recorded upon grant and represents the difference between the grant price and the fair value of our common stock options granted during these periods 
deferred compensation expense is being amortized using the graded vesting method  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas and fasb interpretation no 
 over the vesting period of each respective option  generally four years 
under the graded vesting method  each option grant is separated into portions based on its vesting terms  which results in acceleration of amortization expense for the overall award 
the accelerated amortization pattern results in expensing approximately of the total award in year one  in year two  in year three and in year four 
deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity 
as required by apb  we record an adjustment to stock based compensation when employees forfeit options for which compensation expense had been recognized using the graded vesting method  but which were unvested on the date their employment terminated 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information about our equity based compensation programs 
we have not reported an operating profit for any year since our incorporation and have experienced net losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as we enter fiscal  we continue to face significant challenges with respect to revenue  gross margin  and operating expenses 
we are taking a number of steps to address these challenges 
to increase revenues  we plan to expand our dsl and vop product portfolio and introduce products that enable optical access applications 
also  in order to geographically diversify our existing business and drive increased sales from these new products  we are increasing our investment in our sales and marketing resources 
to accommodate the difficult pricing environment that we expect to face for the foreseeable future  we are making efforts to reduce the manufacturing costs and expenses of our products 
in the near term  we expect that some of the steps that we are taking will result in continuing downward pressure on income from operations 
for example  sales and marketing expenses will increase as a result of increased personnel resources 
also  research and development expenses will increase due to additions to our engineering team and purchasing of additional software development tools 
however  we believe that the steps that we are taking are necessary to achieve our goals of diversifying our business  increasing our revenues and eventually reaching sustained profitability 
our planned actions for fiscal are based on certain assumptions concerning the adoption of broadband technologies  the rate of dsl subscriber growth and the cost and expense structure of our business 
these 
table of contents assumptions could prove to be inaccurate 
if current economic conditions deteriorate to an unexpected degree  or if our planned actions are not successful in achieving our goals  there could be additional adverse impacts on our financial position  revenues  profitability or cash flows 
in that case  we might need to modify our strategic focus and restructure our business to realign our resources and achieve additional cost and expense savings 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain data from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
years ended december  total net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles impairment of goodwill in process research and development total operating expenses operating loss interest income  net gain loss on non current investment benefit provision for income taxes net loss years ended december  and total net revenues total net revenues in were million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
the growth in revenue was due to a increase in the number of dsl ports shipped  offset by a decrease in the average selling price of our dsl products 
voice over packet unit sales increased  but were offset by a decrease in the average selling price 
revenue from our dsl products accounted for million or of total net revenues in  as compared to million or of total net revenues in revenues from voice over packet products accounted for million of revenues in as compared to million in  or and of total net revenues  respectively 
we anticipate that revenues from our dsl products will continue to account for greater than of our total net revenues in we expect our revenues in the first six months of to be lower than the same period of as our customers work through their existing inventories and implement transition plans to our next generation of products to be introduced in the second quarter of competition and technological change in the rapidly evolving dsl market has and may continue to influence our quarterly and annual net revenues and results of operations 
average selling prices of our dsl and voice over packet products tend to be higher at the time we introduce new products and decline over time due to competitive pressures 
we expect this pattern to continue with existing and future products 
our average selling prices are also impacted by our customer concentration and product mix 
our major customers for the year ended december  were nec and sumitomo who represented and of net revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   nec and sumitomo represented 
table of contents and of net revenues  respectively 
revenues from international customers  who were primarily located in japan  comprised and of our net revenues in each of the years ended december  and cost of revenues  gross profit and gross profit margin cost of revenues includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  packaging  test and quality assurance for semiconductor products  royalties related to purchased technology  and manufacturing overhead  including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support 
cost of revenues was million in and million in resulting in gross profit of million in and in gross profit margin was for both and the increase in gross profit in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased sales volumes offset by decreased average selling prices 
we maintained our gross profit margin from to through improved yields  lower subcontractor costs  increased absorption of manufacturing overhead costs as a result of the increased volumes  and lower stock based compensation expense 
our future gross profit margins may be affected by competitive pricing strategies  fluctuation in the volume of our product sales  fluctuations in silicon wafer costs  possible changes in product mix and the introduction of certain lower margin products  among other factors 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  prototype costs related to the fabrication of our silicon chips  depreciation associated with software development tools  and amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures  the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability in our expenses 
research and development expenses in were million  compared to million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in salaries and personnel related expenses  a million decrease in software rental expense and amortization of software leases and maintenance contracts  and a million decrease in stock based compensation expense  partially offset by a million increase in consulting expense 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in fiscal as a result of the planned headcount increases supporting new development programs  salary and bonus plan increases  prototype costs  and depreciation on purchased software development tools 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales  customer service and applications engineering support functions  costs associated with promotional and other marketing expenses  as well as amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
sales and marketing expenses in were million  compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in items such as salaries and personnel related expenses  severance pay expense  expatriate allowance and travel expenses  and a decrease of  in depreciation  partially offset by a  increase in amortization of deferred compensation 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in fiscal as we expand our sales force and marketing personnel to support growth of our business outside of japan as well as our newly developed products 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses for executives  finance  accounting  facilities  information services  and human resources  corporate insurance  amortization of deferred stock based compensation  recruiting expenses  legal  audit and other professional fees  and other corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in both and while expense levels remained relatively constant year over year there was a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million and a  decrease in legal and professional fees  offset by an increase of  in bonus expense 
in addition  net bad debt expense increased by  in compared to primarily as a result of reducing our bad debt reserve in the prior year 
we expect general and administration expenses to increase in as we incur additional costs related to further investments in our business and as we continue to implement the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 

table of contents amortization of deferred compensation and non cash stock compensation deferred compensation represents the difference between the grant price and the fair value for financial statement reporting purposes of the company s common stock option grants 
amortization of deferred compensation was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily related to the use of the graded vesting method  which results in accelerated amortization of deferred compensation expense in the earlier years of the awards expected life  as well as adjustments in related to forfeited options 
as required by apb  we record an adjustment to stock based compensation expense related to employees who forfeit options for which compensation expense had been recognized using the graded vesting method  but which are unvested on the date their employment terminated 
the expense for the amortization of deferred compensation is expected to decrease substantially in as we enter the last year of the graded vesting method which generally represents only of the total expense to be incurred 
interest income  net interest income  net was million in  compared to million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates obtained on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio 
benefit provision for income taxes we recorded a tax provision of  for the year ended december   which represents state income taxes and foreign income taxes 
we recorded a benefit for income taxes of  for the year ended december   which represents a refund of us federal income taxes  offset by foreign income taxes 
as of december   we have million and million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes  respectively 
we also have federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million respectively 
the federal net operating losses and federal credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the california net operating losses are not available to offset income until due to recent state law changes 
utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and our reported cumulative net losses to date  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
net losses we incurred net losses of million in compared to million in the decrease in net loss of million is primarily the result of higher gross profit of million  lower salary and related personnel expenses of million  lower amortization of acquisition related intangibles and the absence of a prior year charge for impairment of goodwill of million  lower software rental expense and amortization of software leases and maintenance expense of million and lower expense for stock based compensation expense of million  partially offset by higher consulting expense of million and higher bonus expense of  net loss per common share was in and in years ended december  and total net revenues total net revenues in were million  compared with million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in revenues is primarily due to a decrease in the average selling prices of our dsl products which accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
this was partially offset by a increase in unit volume shipments that provided approximately million of revenue in revenue from our dsl products accounted for million or of total net revenues in 
table of contents  as compared to million or of total net revenues in revenues from voice over packet products accounted for million of revenues in as compared to million in  or and of total net revenues  respectively

the decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage was primarily due to lower average selling prices per unit  partially offset by lower per unit product costs 
our gross margins in the future may be affected by competitive pricing strategies and the future introduction of certain lower margin items 
research and development expenses research and development expenses in were million  compared to million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in the amortization of deferred stock based compensation and a decrease in software expense 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses in were million  compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in the amortization of deferred stock based compensation  a decrease in customer evaluation board costs and a decrease in sales commissions  partially offset by increases in salary and severance costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses in were million  compared to million in  a decrease of  which was primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million  a decrease in bad debt expense of  and decreases in expensed software and legal and stock administration fees  offset by increases in business insurance costs 
amortization of deferred compensation and non cash stock compensation amortization of deferred stock based compensation  which is allocated among the above expense categories  was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily related to the use of the graded vesting method  which results in accelerated amortization of deferred compensation expense in the earlier years of the awards expected life  as well as adjustments in related to forfeited options 
as required by apb  we record an adjustment to stock based compensation related to employees who forfeit options for which compensation expense had been recognized using the graded vesting method  but which are unvested on the date their employment terminated 
amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which required us to discontinue the amortization of goodwill effective january  in addition  in accordance with sfas we reclassified assembled workforce to goodwill  which eliminated the amortization of assembled workforce effective january impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test 
based upon this test  we recorded a charge of million to fully write down the value of goodwill associated with our purchase transactions 
no comparable charges were incurred in in process research and development expense in  we did not have any acquired in process research and development 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we wrote off million of acquired in process 
table of contents research and development ipr d related to our acquisition of vengines  inc the entire ipr d charge of million related to one project 
this project related to the development of high density voice processing semiconductor products  which bridge circuit switched voice and data networks 
the write off was necessary because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and there were no alternative future uses for the technology 
gain loss on long term investment we monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our long term equity investment and if events and circumstances indicate that a decline in value of this asset is other than temporary  we write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value 
in june  in connection with the ongoing evaluation and review of our only long term equity investment  we recorded a non cash charge of  to write down the basis of this investment to zero as a result of this impairment 
in january  we sold this equity investment for  and reported this as a gain in the first quarter of interest income  net interest income  net was million in  compared to million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates obtained on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio  and slightly lower average invested balances 
benefit provision for income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of  for the year ended december   which represents a refund of us federal income taxes  offset by foreign income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december   which represents federal and state minimum taxes as well as foreign income taxes 
net losses we incurred net losses of million in compared to million in the increase in net loss of million or is primarily the result of lower gross profit of million  the write off of goodwill of million  and higher depreciation and amortization expense of million partially offset by lower expenses for deferred stock based compensation of million  in process research and development of million  goodwill amortization of million  bad debt expense of  and lower interest income of million 
net loss per common share was in and in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million at december  short term investments are defined as income yielding securities with no maturity dates or maturity dates greater than days when purchased that can be readily converted into cash 
cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily due to our investing million of our cash in short term investments and the use of million in operations  offset by proceeds of million from employee stock plans 
operating activities during used million in cash 
this was primarily the result of the net loss of million  an increase in our accounts receivable of million  an increase in our inventories of million  an increase of million in other prepaids and current assets  and a decrease in accounts payable of million  offset by the non cash impact of a million of depreciation and amortization and million in amortization of deferred stock based compensation and an increase in accrued liabilities and accrued payroll and related expenses of million 
net cash used by operating activities increased significantly in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of this was due largely to the decline in revenues and gross margins without a commensurate decrease in operating expenses for the quarter 
we expect to increase operating expenses and use additional cash in as we add planned headcount and incur additional expenses to support new pon and vop product lines 

table of contents accounts receivable increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in accounts receivable resulted primarily from the timing of shipments  as a significant portion of the fourth quarter s shipments were made in the last month of the quarter 
in addition  accounts receivable in were lower due to an early payment from a significant customer at the end of the year 
inventories increased million to million at december  in  lead times at our major foundry subcontractor increased to between and weeks for several of our key products compared to and weeks in the extended lead time required us to place orders with the foundry based on sales forecast well ahead of firm purchase commitments 
as our sales fell below sales forecast in the fourth quarter  we ended the quarter with higher inventories 
net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december   and was primarily related to net purchases of short term investments of million and purchases of fixed assets of million 
as of december   our short term securities were invested primarily in government agency instruments totaling million  auction rate securities totaling million  and municipal and corporate bonds totaling million 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   and was related to the net proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of million and  from proceeds required to be disgorged by a shareholder  offset by million of capital lease payments 
our stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests 
we consider our option program critical to our operations and productivity 
all of our full time employees participate in this program 
the program consists of two plans  one under which officers  directors and employees may be granted options to purchase shares of our stock and a broad based plan under which options may be granted to all employees other than directors 
our principal source of liquidity as of december  consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
there are no assurances that we can reduce losses from operations and avoid negative cash flow or raise capital as needed to fund the operations 
however  based on current plans and business conditions  but subject to the discussion in the business section and risk factors section  we believe our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
the rate at which we will consume cash will be dependent on the cash needs of future operations  which will  in turn  be directly affected by the levels of demand for our products 
significant cash based operating commitments in future periods include lease payments and inventory purchase commitments 
as of december   future obligations totaled million  million of which will be paid in fiscal inventory purchase commitments of approximately million as of december  will be paid in the first six months of fiscal 
table of contents significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments are shown in the table below in thousands total less than year years after years operating leases facilities capital leases software operating leases software inventory purchases total cash obligations if we are able to sustain our current business plan and general economic conditions stabilize  we hope to achieve profitability in we believe our revenue forecast and the steps we have taken to increase revenue while controlling spending will allow us to achieve that objective 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors that affect our research  development  collaboration and sales and marketing activities 
we believe that existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for these cash flow and profitability expectations are subject to numerous assumptions  many of which may not actually occur 
if some or all of such assumptions do not occur  our results may be substantially lower or different than expected 
such assumptions include  without limitation  assumptions that new product introductions will occur on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance  that our existing and potential customer base will continue to grow and that our industry s competitive landscape will not change adversely 
for more information about the risks relating to our business  please read carefully the risk factors set forth below 
we expect to devote capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to support our sales  marketing  and product development programs  to establish additional facilities worldwide and to fund other general corporate activities 
from time to time  we receive various inquiries or claims in connection with intellectual property and other rights and may become party to associated claims 
in certain cases  management has accrued estimates of the amounts it expects to pay upon resolution of such matters 
depending on the amount and timing of the resolutions of these claims  our future cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period 
if our existing resources and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
the sale of equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results

table of contents risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this form k 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
we have a history of losses and we may not achieve profitability 
we have not reported an operating profit for any year since our incorporation and have experienced net losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate lower margins  which could adversely affect our profitability 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline as they mature 
historically  competition in the semiconductor industry has driven down the average selling prices of products 
if we price our products too high  our customers may use a competitor s product or an in house solution 
to maintain profit margins  we must reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in average selling prices or successfully sell proportionately more new products with higher average selling prices 
yield or other production problems or shortages of supply may preclude us from lowering or maintaining current product costs 
we have also experienced more aggressive price competition from competitors in market segments in which we are attempting to expand our business 
these circumstances may make some of our products less competitive  and we may be forced to decrease our prices significantly to win a design 
we may lose design opportunities or may experience overall declines in gross margins as a result of increased price competition 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile and will likely continue to fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of integrated circuit companies  announcements by us  our competitors or others in related market segments of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  loss or decrease in sales to a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions  loss or reduction in manufacturing capacity from one or more of our key suppliers  additions or departures of key personnel  future sales of our common stock  inconsistent or low levels of trading volume of our common stock  commencement of or involvement in litigation  
table of contents announcements by us or our competitors of key design wins and product introductions  a decrease in the average selling price of our products  ability to achieve cost reductions  and fluctuations in the timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments 
a general economic slowdown  and a slowdown in spending in the telecommunications industry  has affected and may continue to negatively affect our business and operating results 
there have been announcements throughout the worldwide telecommunications industry of current and planned reductions in component inventory levels and equipment production volumes  and of delays in the build out of new infrastructure 
any of these trends  if continued  could result in lower than expected demand for our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations generally  and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
specifically  we have experienced reduced demand for our products  increased price competition for our products  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories  excess facilities and manufacturing capacity  and higher general and administrative costs  as a percentage of revenue 
recent geopolitical and social turmoil in many parts of the world  including actual incidents and potential future acts of terrorism and war  may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions 
these geopolitical and social conditions  together with the resulting economic uncertainties  make it extremely difficult for our company  our customers and our vendors to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
this reduced predictability challenges our ability to operate profitably or to increase revenues 
in particular  it is difficult to develop and implement strategies to create sustainable business models and efficient operations  and to effectively manage outsourced relationships for services such as contract manufacturing and information technology 
if the current uncertain economic conditions continue or deteriorate  there could be additional material adverse impact on our financial position  revenues  results of operations  or cash flow 
a slowdown in deployment of dsl in japan would adversely affect our business and operating results 
sales to customers located in japan accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to of net revenues for year ended december  our sales are dependent on the continuous additions to dsl subscribers in japan and a slow down in new dsl subscribers may cause our revenue to decline 
our sales have been historically denominated in us dollars and major fluctuations in currency exchange rates could materially affect our japanese customers demand  thereby forcing them to reduce their orders  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we derive a substantial amount of our revenues from japan  and our failure to diversify the geographic sources of our revenue could harm our business and operating results 
because a substantial portion of our revenues have been derived from sales into japan  our revenues have been heavily dependent on developments in the japan market 
while part of our strategy is to diversify the geographic sources of our revenues  failure to further penetrate markets outside of japan could harm our business and results of operations 

table of contents competing dsl technologies which have been deployed in japan may adversely impact the demand for our dsl products  market share and operating results 
we have worked in partnership with local telecommunications companies to develop the annex c standard for the dsl market in japan and have been able to achieve the majority market share of dsl equipment purchases  based on our products  in japan 
in july  a certain service provider announced plans to deploy lower priced competing dsl technologies in japan and has subsequently deployed these competing technologies 
if these competing technologies continue to be successful  our market share in the dsl market in japan may decline  and our business and operating results may be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial amount of our revenues from international sources  and difficulties associated with international operations could harm our business 
a substantial portion of our revenues has been derived from customers located outside of the united states 
for and  and  respectively  of our net revenues were to customers located in asia 
we may be unable to successfully overcome the difficulties associated with international operations 
these difficulties include staffing and managing foreign operations  changes in regulatory requirements  licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in protecting intellectual property rights in some foreign countries  a limited ability to enforce agreements and other rights in some foreign countries  obtaining governmental approvals for products  and complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties 
because sales of our products are denominated exclusively in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
we depend on a few customers  and if we lose any of them our sales and operations will suffer 
we sell dsl products primarily to network equipment manufacturers 
our top two customers for the year ended december  were nec and sumitomo  accounting for and of our net revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   nec and sumitomo accounted for and of our net revenues  respectively 
we do not have contractual volume commitments with these customers but rather sell our products to them on an order by order basis 
we expect to be dependent upon a relatively small number of large customers in future periods  although the specific customers may vary from period to period 
if we are not successful in maintaining relationships with key customers and winning new customers  our business and results of operations will suffer 
we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties  and any significant order cancellations or deferrals could adversely affect our business 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders that customers can generally cancel or defer on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
any significant cancellations or deferrals in the future could 
table of contents materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  cancellations or deferrals of product orders  the return of previously sold products or the overproduction of products due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could cause us to hold excess or obsolete inventory  which could reduce our profit margins  increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
furthermore  we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products  we could incur significant charges against our revenue 
our customers may demand preferential terms or delay our sales cycle  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
our customers are in most cases larger than us and are able to exert a high degree of influence over us 
these customers may have sufficient bargaining power to demand low prices and other terms and conditions that may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  prior to selling our products to such customers  we must typically undergo lengthy product approval processes  often taking up to one year 
accordingly  we are continually submitting successive versions of our products  as well as new products  to our customers for approval 
the length of the approval process can vary and is affected by a number of factors  including customer priorities  customer budgets and regulatory issues affecting telecommunications service providers 
delays in the product approval process could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have been successful in the past in obtaining product approvals from our customers  such approvals and the ensuing sales of such products may not continue to occur 
delays can also be caused by late deliveries by other vendors  changes in implementation priorities and slower than anticipated growth in demand for the services that our products support 
a delay in  or cancellation of  the sale of our products could adversely affect our results from operations or cause them to significantly vary from quarter to quarter 
sales of our products depend on the widespread adoption of broadband access services  especially dsl 
if the demand for broadband access services does not increase  we may not be able to generate substantial sales 
sales of our products depend on the increased use and widespread adoption of broadband access services  and dsl services in particular  and the ability of telecommunications service providers to market and sell broadband access services 
our business would be harmed  and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected  if the use of broadband access services does not increase as anticipated 
certain critical factors will likely continue to affect the development of the broadband access service market 
these factors include inconsistent quality and reliability of service  lack of availability of cost effective  high speed service  lack of interoperability among multiple vendors network equipment  congestion in service providers networks  inadequate security  and slow deployment of new broadband services over dsl lines 
because other broadband technologies may compete effectively with dsl services or other services addressed by our products  a slowdown in deployment of dsl services  the lack of significant growth in non dsl markets that we are targeting and our lack of success in penetrating such markets would adversely affect our business and operating results 
our revenues are heavily dependent on the increase in demand for dsl services 
dsl services are competing with a variety of different broadband data transmission technologies  including cable modems  
table of contents satellite and other wireless technologies 
while part of our strategy is to diversify our product markets beyond dsl into such areas as optical access and vop  if any technology that is competing with the technologies that we offer is more reliable  faster and or less expensive or has any other advantages over the technologies for which we have products  then the demand for our products may decrease 
the lack of significant growth in those markets we are targeting in general and the lack of success of our products in particular would also adversely affect our business and results of operations 
because the sales cycle for our products typically lasts up to one year and may be subject to delays  it is difficult to forecast sales for any given period 
if we fail to realize forecasted sales for a particular period  our stock price could decline significantly 
the sales cycle of our products is lengthy and typically involves a detailed initial technical evaluation of our products by our prospective customers  followed by the design  construction and testing of prototypes incorporating our products 
only after these steps are complete will we receive a purchase order from a customer for volume shipments 
this process generally takes from to months and may last longer 
given this lengthy sales cycle  it is difficult to accurately predict when sales to a particular customer will occur 
in addition  we may experience unexpected delays in orders from customers  which may prevent us from realizing forecasted sales for a particular period 
our products are typically sold to equipment manufacturers  who incorporate our products in the products that they in turn sell to consumers or to network service providers 
as a result  any delay by our customers  or by our customers customers  in the manufacture or distribution of their products will result in a delay in obtaining orders for our products  which could cause our business and results to suffer 
rapid changes in the market for dsl chipsets may render our chipsets obsolete or unmarketable 
the market for chipsets for dsl products is characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions by our competitors  changes in customer demands  and evolving industry standards 
any of these factors could make our products obsolete or unmarketable 
in addition  the life cycles of some of our products may depend upon the life cycles of the end products into which our products will be designed 
products with short life cycles require us to closely manage production and inventory levels 
unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products and or the estimated life cycles of the end products into which our products are designed may result in obsolete or excess inventories  which in turn may adversely affect our operating results 
to compete  we must innovate and introduce new products 
if we fail to successfully introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis that meet customer requirements and are compatible with evolving industry standards  then our business  financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed 
our markets are highly competitive  and many of our competitors are established and have greater resources than we have 
the market for communications semiconductor and software products is intensely competitive 
given our stage of development  there is a substantial risk that we will not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully 
in addition  a number of other semiconductor companies have announced their intent to enter the market segments adjacent to or addressed by our products 

table of contents these competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
we may also face competition from customers or prospective customers own internal development efforts 
any of these competitors may be able to introduce new technologies  respond more quickly to changing customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
because our products are components of other equipment  if broadband equipment manufacturers do not incorporate our products in their equipment  we may not be able to generate sales of our products in volume quantities 
our products are not sold directly to the end user  they are components of other products 
as a result  we rely upon equipment manufacturers to design our products into their equipment 
we further rely on the manufacturing and deployment of the equipment to be successful 
if equipment that incorporates our products is not accepted in the marketplace  we may not achieve sales of our products in volume quantities  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
because manufacturers of communications equipment may be reluctant to change their sources of components  if we do not achieve design wins with such manufacturers  we may be unable to secure sales from these customers in the future 
once a manufacturer of communications equipment has designed a supplier s semiconductor into its products  the manufacturer may be reluctant to change its source of semiconductors due to the significant costs associated with qualifying a new supplier 
accordingly  our failure to achieve design wins with equipment manufacturers  who have chosen a competitor s semiconductor could create barriers to future sales opportunities with these manufacturers 
third party claims regarding intellectual property matters could cause us to stop selling our products  pay monetary damages or obtain licenses on adverse terms 
there is a significant risk that third parties  including current and potential competitors  will claim that our products  or our customers products  infringe on their intellectual property rights 
the owners of these intellectual property rights may bring infringement claims against us or our customers 
any such litigation  whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us  would be costly and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 
inquiries with respect to the coverage of our intellectual property could develop into litigation 
in the event of an adverse ruling for an intellectual property infringement claim  we could be required to obtain a license or pay substantial damages or have the sale of our products stopped by an injunction 
such a license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  if a customer of our products cannot acquire a required license on commercially reasonable terms  that customer may choose not to use our products 
we have obligations to indemnify our customers under some circumstances for infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
if any intellectual property claims from third parties against one of our customers whom we have indemnified is held to be valid  the costs to us could be substantial and our business could be harmed 
we have received correspondence from certain parties  including texas instruments  alcatel and ricoh  requesting us to discuss the potential need for non exclusive licenses permitting us to utilize technology covered by various patents held by these parties 
we could be subject to claims similar to the texas instruments  alcatel and ricoh claims in the future 
depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable resolutions of these claims  our future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents if we deliver products with defects  our credibility will be harmed  and the sales and market acceptance of our products will decrease 
our products are complex and have contained errors  defects and bugs when introduced and revised 
if we deliver products with errors  defects or bugs or products that have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our products could be harmed  which could adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
further  if our products contain errors  defects and bugs  then we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate such problems and may have our sales to customers interrupted or delayed 
if any of these problems are not found until we have commenced commercial production  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product repair or replacement costs 
defects could also lead to potential liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers 
we have agreed to indemnify our customers in some circumstances against liability from defects in our products 
a successful product liability claim could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations  and may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts 
we depend on sole source suppliers for several key components of our products 
we obtain certain parts  components and packaging used in the delivery of our products from sole sources of supply 
for example  we obtain semiconductor wafers from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co  ltd  semiconductor manufacturing international corporation and united microelectronics corporation 
if we fail to obtain components in sufficient quantities when required or if we cannot adequately control manufacturing process quality  product yields or production costs  our business could be harmed 
developing and maintaining these strategic relationships with our vendors is critical for us to be successful 
any of our sole source suppliers may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors  stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices  refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price  or be subject to production disruptions such as earthquakes 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration and that may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
in order to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition will require us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and redesign some products 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs  and we have designed some of our products to be manufactured in 
micron  
micron  
micron and 
micron geometry processes 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes  which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry relationships 
if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  or at all 

table of contents future consolidation in the telecommunications equipment industry may increase competition that could harm our business 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by increasing consolidation both within the telecommunications equipment sector and by companies combining or acquiring data communications assets and assets for delivering voice related services 
we cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors 
we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry 
increased competition and consolidation in our industry may require that we reduce the prices of our products or result in a loss of market share  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  because we are now  and may in the future be  dependent on certain strategic relationships with third parties in our industry  any additional consolidation involving these parties could reduce the demand for our products and otherwise harm our business prospects 
we may make future acquisitions and acquisitions involve numerous risks 
our business is highly competitive and  as such  our growth is dependent upon market growth  our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 
one of the ways we have addressed and may continue to address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of other companies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we must also maintain our ability to manage such growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions could harm our business and operating results 
our executive officers and key personnel are critical to our business  and these officers and personnel may not remain with us in the future 
we depend upon the continuing contributions of our key management  sales  customer support and product development personnel 
the loss of such personnel could seriously harm us 
in addition  we have not obtained key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or key employees 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and the technologies used in our principal products  and if we do not enforce and protect our intellectual property  our business will be harmed 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these measures afford only limited protection 
our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect us 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary 

table of contents the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  and many us companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in these countries 
there is a risk that our efforts to protect proprietary rights may not be adequate 
for example  our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around our patents or our other intellectual property rights 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property or if the laws of a foreign jurisdiction do not effectively permit such protection  it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products 
we may need to raise additional capital which might not be available or which  if available  could be on terms adverse to our common stockholders 
we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least twelve months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
we may also require additional capital for the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to ours 
further  if we issue equity securities  the ownership percentage of our stockholders would be reduced  and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those existing holders of our common stock 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while concurrently maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we may invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the current value of the principal amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market funds  high quality commercial paper  government and non government debt securities and auction rate preferred securities 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities as of december  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements
