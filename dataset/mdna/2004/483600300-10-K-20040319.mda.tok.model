overview we are a leading provider of customer relationship management crm software solutions  specifically  customer service and marketing solutions 
our applications enable organizations to improve the quality and efficiency of interactions with customers and partners across multiple communication points  including web contact  web collaboration  email  and telephone 
as a result  our target market is large enterprises with a high volume of customer interactions  such as banks  telecommunications companies  high tech manufacturers  healthcare organizations  and government agencies 
to a large degree  we rely on our relationships with leading system integrators who co develop  recommend  and install our software 
this provides leverage in the selling phase  and also allows us to realize higher gross margins by selling primarily software licenses and support  which typically have higher margins than consulting and implementation services 
however  since our applications are generally installed by our customers using a system integrator  these services generally increase the cost of the project substantially  subjecting their purchase to more levels of required approval and scrutiny of projected cost savings in their customer service and marketing departments 
consequently  we face difficulty predicting the quarter in which sales to expected customers will occur  if at all  which contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 
moreover  to the extent that significant sales occur earlier or later than anticipated  revenues for subsequent quarters may be lower or higher  respectively  than expected 
we have grown rapidly through acquisitions until recent years 
these acquisitions provided us with much of the core technology used in our applications 
in more recent years  we have substantially reduced the scale of our operations as we began leveraging the service and development capabilities of system integrators  and have acted to reduce costs and focus our product offerings 
in the past three years  we have experienced a cautious purchasing environment in our industry 
we feel that this is largely a reaction to the uncertain economy  which had a disproportionate effect on information technology spending 
while general economic conditions began to stabilize and improve in the second half of  we believe that our market continued to exhibit cautiousness and uncertainty and that as a result  many enterprises continued to be reluctant to invest in large crm applications 
since we have incurred substantial costs to develop our products and to recruit  train and compensate personnel for our engineering  sales  marketing  client services and administration departments 
as a result  we have incurred substantial losses since inception 
for the twelve months ended december   we recorded a net loss of million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of billion  which includes approximately billion related to goodwill impairment charges 
we expect to decrease our operating losses in as a result of our personnel and facility cost reductions throughout we expect our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for the next months 
in june  we completed a merger with broadbase software 
this transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price approximated million 
in november  we announced the completion of an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we offered the common stock under our shelf registration statement 
in addition to the  shares sold in the public offering  the underwriter exercised  in full  an option to purchase a maximum of  additional shares to cover over allotments of shares 
the proceeds from the offering  net of expenses  were approximately million 
as of december   we had full time employees  which represents a decrease from employees at december  over half of the decrease during was related to our elimination of research and development positions in connection with our subcontracting a significant portion of our software programming  quality assurance and technical documentation activities to third party development partners with staffing in india and china 
on february   we completed the acquisition of hipbone  inc  a leading provider of online customer interaction solutions 
this transaction will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price is expected to approximate million 
as a result of this acquisition  we now offer hipbone s web collaboration  chat  co browsing and file sharing capabilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  collectibility of receivables  goodwill and intangible assets  contract loss reserve  income taxes  and restructuring 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates significantly affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue recognition rules for software companies are complex  and various judgments affect the recognition of revenues 
the amount and timing of our revenue is difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
license revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery to the customer has occurred  provided the arrangement does not require significant customization or modification of the software  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements with the residual amounts of revenue being allocated to the delivered elements 
elements included in multiple element arrangements primarily consist of software products  maintenance which includes customer support services and unspecified upgrades  or consulting services 
vendor specific objective evidence for software products and consulting services is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before market introduction 
vendor specific objective evidence for maintenance is generally based on stated contractual renewal rates 
evaluating whether sufficient and appropriate vendor specific objective evidence exists to use in allocating revenue to undelivered elements  and the interpretation of such evidence to determine the fair value of undelivered elements is subject to judgment and estimates that affect when and to what extent we may recognize revenues from a given contractual arrangement 
probability of collection is based upon assessment of the customer s financial condition through review of their current financial statements or publicly available credit reports 
for sales to existing customers  prior payment history is also considered in assessing probability of collection 
we exercise significant judgment in deciding whether collectibility is reasonably assured  and such judgments may materially affect the timing of our revenues and our results of operations 
revenues from support are primarily for the purpose of providing global support for our customers and partners  including phone and e mail support and self service solutions  as well as product maintenance updates and unspecified upgrades 
support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenues in and were generated primarily by providing specific subject matter expertise as opposed to overall project management and were performed on a time and materials basis 
in september  we shifted our strategy to have our customers use third party systems integrators for their implementation of our software 
some consulting engagements prior to september included implementation and project management and some such engagements were provided on a fixed fee basis  under separate service arrangements 
implementation or project management services performed under fixed fee arrangements were generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
we have not entered into any new fixed fee implementation services since september for any arrangement in which customer acceptance was not assured or an ability to reliably estimate costs was not possible  we used the completed contract method  whereby revenues and related costs were deferred until all contractual obligations were met  and acceptance  if required by the contract  was received 
revenues from training services are recognized as services are performed 
collectibility of receivables 
in order to recognize revenue from a transaction  collectibility must be determined by management to be reasonably assured 
if collectibility is not determined to be reasonably assured  amounts billed to customers are recorded as deferred revenue 
for sales to existing customers  prior payment history is a factor in assessing probability of collection 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for receivables that may not be collectible 
a considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of receivables 
in assessing collectibility  we consider the age of the receivable  our historical collection experience  current economic trends  and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
in the future  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
reserve for loss contract 
for professional services arrangements involving a fixed fee  we assess whether a loss reserve is necessary  estimate the total expected costs of providing services necessary to complete the contract and compare these costs to the fees expected to be received under the contract 
for example  we were party to a contract with a customer that provided for fixed fee payments in exchange for services upon meeting certain milestone criteria 
based on the analysis we performed in the fourth quarter of  we expected the costs to complete the project to exceed the associated fees  and accordingly we recorded a loss reserve of million in the quarter ended december  as a result of our restructuring in the third quarter of  substantially all of the remaining professional services required under the contract were being provided by a third party  and we recorded an additional loss reserve of million based upon an analysis of costs to complete these services 
in the second quarter of  we began discussions with the customer regarding the timing and scope of the project deliverables  which led to an amendment in august to the original contract 
based on the amendment and associated negotiations with a third party integrator that had been providing implementation services to the customer  we recorded a charge of approximately million to cost of services revenue in the second quarter of and in accordance with the terms of the amendment were relieved from providing any further implementation services under the contract 
the amendment required that we transfer million to an escrow account which included million previously reported as restricted cash to compensate any third party integrator for the continued implementation of the customer s system 
the charge also included million of fees that we had paid the third party integrator prior to the amendment 
during the second quarter of  we received a scheduled payment of million associated with the original agreement that we reported as deferred revenue 
the million is being recognized as revenue as we fulfill our support and training obligations 
as of december   we have recognized million of the million as revenue  and million remains in deferred revenue  of which million relates to support and will be recognized evenly through the first quarter of the remaining million relates to training and will be recognized as we perform training obligations  but not later than the third quarter of when the training credits expire 
accounting for internal use software 
internal use software costs  including fees paid to third parties to implement the software  are capitalized beginning when we have determined various factors are present  including among others  that technology exists to achieve the performance requirements  we have made a decision as to whether we will purchase the software or develop it internally and we have authorized funding for the project 
capitalization of software costs ceases when the software implementation is substantially complete and is ready for its intended use  and the capitalized costs are amortized over the software s estimated useful life generally five years using the straight line method 
as of december   we had million of capitalized costs of internal use software  net of million accumulated depreciation 
when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of internal use software might not be recoverable  we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the amortization of the asset balance over its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
the amount of impairment  if any  is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the projected discounted future operating cash flows and is recognized as a write down of the asset 
in addition  if it is no longer probable that computer software being developed will be placed in service  the asset will be adjusted to the lower of its carrying value or fair value  if any  less direct selling costs 
any such adjustment would result in an expense in the period recorded  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of operations 
based on our assessment as of december   we determined that no such impairment of internal use software existed 
restructuring 
during  we recorded significant liabilities in connection with our restructuring program 
these reserves included estimates pertaining to contractual obligations related to excess leased facilities 
we have a total of approximately  square feet of excess space available for sublease or renegotiation 
locations of the excess space include menlo park  california  princeton  new jersey and marlow in the united kingdom 
remaining lease commitment terms on these leases vary from seven to eight years 
we are seeking to sublease or renegotiate the obligations associated with the excess space 
we had million in accrued restructuring costs as of december   which is our estimate  as of that date  of the exit costs of these excess facilities 
we have worked with real estate brokers in each of the markets where the properties are located to help us estimate the amount of the accrual 
this process involves significant judgments regarding these markets 
if we determine that any of these real estate markets continues to deteriorate  additional adjustments to this accrual may be required  which would result in additional restructuring expenses in the period in which such determination is made 
likewise  if any of these real estate markets strengthen  and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected  or if we are otherwise able to negotiate early termination of obligations on favorable terms  adjustments to the accrual may be required that would increase income in the period in which such determination is made 
as of december   our estimate of accrued restructuring cost includes an assumption of receiving million in sublease payments that are not yet under contractual arrangement  and in most cases  a potential subleasor has not been identified 
we have assumed that the majority of these sublease payments will begin in through and continue through the end of the related leases 
goodwill and intangible assets 
consideration paid in connection with acquisitions is required to be allocated to the acquired assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities acquired 
acquired assets and liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of fair value  which requires significant judgment with respect to future cash flows and discount rates 
for intangible assets other than goodwill  we are required to estimate the useful life of the asset and recognize its cost as an expense over the useful life 
we use the straight line method to expense long lived assets  which results in an equal amount of expense being recorded in each period 
amortization of goodwill ceased as of january  upon our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
instead  we are now required to test goodwill for impairment under certain circumstances and write down goodwill when it is impaired 
we have determined that our consolidated results comprise one reporting unit for the purpose of impairment testing through december  we regularly evaluate all potential indicators of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions  operational performance of our acquired businesses and identification of reporting units 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
under the transition provisions of sfas no 
 there was no goodwill impairment at january  based upon our analysis completed at that time 
however  during the quarter ended june   circumstances developed that indicated goodwill was likely impaired 
the circumstances that lead to the impairment included the revision of estimates of our revenues and net loss for the second quarter of and subsequent quarters  based upon preliminary revenue results late in the second quarter of and the reduction of estimated revenue and cash flows 
as a result  we announced preliminary second quarter results on july  following this announcement  the decline in the trading price of our common stock reduced kana s market capitalization  and we performed an impairment analysis as of june  this analysis resulted in a million impairment expense to reduce goodwill 
the circumstances that led to the impairment included the lower than previously expected revenues and net loss for the second quarter of and the revision of estimates of our revenues and net loss for subsequent quarters  based upon financial results for the second quarter of and the reduction of estimated cash flows in future quarters 
we used a combination of discounted cash flows and relevant market data  including our market capitalization during the period following the announcement of preliminary results for the second quarter of  to calculate an estimated fair value and the resulting goodwill impairment 
the estimated fair value was compared to the corresponding carrying value of goodwill at june   which resulted in a reduction of goodwill as of june  by million 
during the three months ended june  we performed our annual test for goodwill impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
we currently operate in one reportable segment  which is also the only reporting unit for the purposes of sfas we completed our evaluation and concluded that goodwill was not impaired as the fair value of our company exceeded its carrying value  including goodwill 
the remaining amount of goodwill as of december  was million 
any further impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we continue to assess whether any potential indicators of impairment of goodwill have occurred and have determined that no such indicators have arisen since june  any further impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as net operating loss carryforwards  and stock based compensation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we concluded that a full valuation allowance was required for all periods presented 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  increasing our income in the period in which such determination was made 
pursuant to the internal revenue code  the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
events which cause limitations in the amount of net operating losses that we may utilize include  but are not limited to  a cumulative change of more than ownership of the company  as defined  over a three year period 
the portion of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards subject to potential expiration has not been included in deferred tax assets 
contingencies and litigation 
we are subject to lawsuits and other claims and proceedings 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss contingency required  if any  for these matters are made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required loss contingencies may change in the future as the facts and circumstances of each matter changes 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected data for the periods presented 
percentages are expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
years ended december  revenues license    service    total revenues    cost of revenues license    service    total cost of revenues    gross profit    operating expenses sales and marketing    research and development    general and administrative    comparison of the years ended december  and revenues total revenues decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of fewer license deals in than in  as well as a decrease in the average sales price per license deal over  realized during compared to we believe the decrease in is due to a multitude of factors including competitive pricing pressures and the continuing slow down in the information technology spending environment 
license revenues include licensing fees only  and exclude associated maintenance and consulting revenue 
the majority of our licenses to customers are perpetual and recognized upon shipment  provided that all revenue recognition criteria are met as discussed in revenue recognition under critical accounting policies above 
license revenues decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for this decrease in license revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the average selling price of license deals  as well as a decrease in the number of license deals closed during the year 
th e decrease in the average selling price of license deals was primarily experience d in the middle of the year 
we expect our average selling price to fluctuate in future quarters given the relatively low number of new deals that comprise the majority of our license revenue recognized per quarter 
as an example  the average quarterly selling price of license deals exceeding  varied from a low of approximately  in the second quarter of to a high of approximately  in the fourth quarter of in addition  we expect that license deals closed in any particular quarter will continue to constitute a significant percentage of the license revenues recognized in that quarter 
our license revenue decreased as a percentage of total revenue due to the reduction in the average selling price of license deals and the number of license deals closed in as discussed above 
we expect license revenues to increase moderately in absolute dollars in from  primaril y due to our expectations of an increase in the average selling price  particularly from the second and third quarters of since those quarters ha d relatively few large deals 
however  the market for our products is unpredictable and intensely competitive  and the economic environment over the last few years has had an effect on corporate purchasing which has impacted sales of our products 
our service revenues consist of either support revenues or professional services 
support revenues relate to providing customer support and product maintenance  product updates and unsepcified upgrades to our customers 
profess ional services revenues relate to providing consulting  training and  to a lesser extent  implementatio n services to our customers 
service revenues decreased by to million fo r the year ended december  from million for the decrease in service revenues was primarily in professional services  due to our customers increased use of independent third party integrators for implementation service s in support revenues were relatively consistent with  at millio n in versus million in the reduction in the sales of new license s in affected service revenues less than license revenues because the majority of our service revenues relate to ongoing support contracts with existing customers 
we expect that service revenues in will be fairly consistent with in absolute dollars as we continue to focus on license sales and using third party integrators for implementation services 
revenues from international sales were million  or of total revenues  in the year ended december  and million  or or tota l revenues  in the year ended december  the decrease in international sales in is primarily as a result of large sales through our integration partner in the united kingdom in that did not recur to the same extent in our international revenues were derived from sales in europe  canada  asi a pacific and latin america 
during we experienced an increase in sales to companies in the telecommunications and financial services sector  representing approximately and  respectively  of our revenues in compared to approximately an d  respectively  in we also experienced a decrease in sales to companie s in the high technology sector  representing approximately of our revenues in compared to approximately in we expect the concentration of sale s to the telecommunications and financial services sectors to decrease slightly i n  offset by relative increases in sales in various other sectors in cost of revenues total cost of revenues decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of license revenues consists of third party software royalties  and to a l eser extent  costs of product packaging  documentation  and production and delivery costs fo r shipments to customers 
cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenue for was compared to in the increase was due to royalt y costs associated with a relatively higher proportion of non revenue related shipments  such as upgrades and updates during we expect that our cost of license revenue as a percentage of sales in will decrease slightly from due to renegotiations of our royalty agreements in late  which allow for royalties based on a percentage of revenue for large deals as opposed to a fixed amount per licensed seat 
cost of service revenues consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for our customer support  consulting  and training services organizations 
cost of service revenues decreased to of service revenues  or million  for compared to  or million  for the prior year 
cost o f service revenues in included approximately million  or of servic e revenues  related to a loss contract with a customer  as discussed in reserve for loss contract under critical accounting policies above 
the improvement in service margins in was also due to the change in service revenues mix throughout following a shift in our strategy in september to have customers use independent third party integrators to provide implementation services  rather than purchase those services from us 
as a result  support revenues comprised a larger percentage o f service revenues during the entire year of  which yielded better margins than professional services revenues since the ratio of customers to personnel i s significantly higher for customer support 
support revenues comprised million  or of total revenues in  compared to million  or in we anticipate that our cost of service revenues will remain relatively constant in dollars  and as a percentage of service revenue  in compared t o operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel and promotional expenditures  including public relations  advertising  trade shows and marketing materials 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in sales and marketing personnel during by  from positions as of december  to positions at december   which resulted in approximately million in savings in salaries and related benefits 
in addition  commission expense in was million lower than i n due to decreases in license revenues in discussed above 
we also spent million less in marketing programs in than in we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in will be fairly consistent with in absolute dollars  and will fluctuate as a percentage of revenues depending on the timing and amount of revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for research and development employees and contractors and enhancement of existing products and quality assurance activities 
research and development expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable primarily to the reduction of personnel during by  from as of december  to at december  and resulted in savings of approximately million i n compensation  benefits  and allocated facility and operations costs 
these reductions in personnel were offset by approximately million in fees associated with our outsourcing strategy begun in the first quarter of  which involves subcontracting a significant portion of our software programming quality assurance and technical documentation activities to development partner s with staffing in india and china 
likewise  expense for contractors in the united states decreased by million in compared to we also realized savings in depreciation expense charged to research and development of million in compared to due to assets placed in service in becoming fully depreciated in we anticipate that research and development expenses will be slightly lower in absolute dollars in than in  particularly in the first and second quarters of compared to the same periods in  and will fluctuate as a percentage of revenues depending on th e timing and amount of revenues 
the anticipated reduction in research and development expense in these periods is due to the fact that we had not yet completed our transition to outsourcing in the first half of and thus incurred duplicative costs during that period 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for finance  legal  human resources  corporate governance  and bad debt expense 
information technology and facilities costs are allocated among all operating departments 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to the reduction in general and administrative personnel during  from finance  legal and human resources related positions at december  to such positions at december   as well as million in net reductions to bad debt expense in we anticipate that general and administrative costs will be slightly lower in absolute dollars in compared to  and will fluctuate as a percentage o f revenues depending on the timing and amount of revenues 
amortization of stock based compensation 
in connection with certain stock option grants to employees  and warrants issued to non employees  we recorded unearned stock based compensation charges 
these charges represent the total difference between the exercise prices of stock options and the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock for accounting purposes on the date these stock options were granted 
amortization of stock based compensation was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  there were no options granted with an exercise price below the fair value of the option shares on the date of grant 
we reversed million of stock based compensation associated with expenses related to unveste d options granted previously that were cancelled during in connection with e mployee terminations 
in  options granted with an exercise price below the fair value of the option shares on the date of grant resulted in a charge of  we reversed million of stock based compensation associated with expenses related to unvested options granted previously that were cancelled dur ing in connection with the merger with broadbase  we recorded unearned stock based compensation totaling approximately million during the year ended december  these amounts are included as a component of stockholders equity and are being amortized on an accelerated basis by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options 
in september  we issued to accenture  shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise pric e of per share pursuant to a stock and warrant purchase agreement in connection with our global strategic alliance 
the shares of the common stock issued were fully vested  and we recorded a deferred stock based compensation charge of approximately million which was amortized through december   consistent with the term of the related original alliance agreement 
as o f december    shares of common stock subject to the warrant were fully vested and  had been forfeited 
the vested portion of the warrant was valued using the black scholes model resulting in charges totaling million of which million was immediately expensed in the fourth quarter of and million is being amortized over the term of the related alliance agreement 
the warrants are exercisable through december  in september  we issued to accenture a fully vested warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share pursuant to a warrant purchase agreement in connection with our original global strategic alliance 
the warrant was valued using the black scholes model resulting in a charge of approximately  which was amortized through december   coincident with the term of the original related alliance agreement 
accenture exercised this additional warrant in march in september  we issued to a customer a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share pursuant to a warrant purchase agreement 
the warrant will become fully vested in september and has a provision for acceleration of vesting by  shares annually over four years if the customer meets certain marketing criteria 
as of decembe r   no such marketing criteria has been met 
the warrant was valued using the black scholes model  resulting in a deferred stock based compensation charg e of approximately  which is being amortized over the four year term of the agreement 
in november  we issued to two investment funds warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share in connection with a proposed financing which was to have been completed in february upon attaining stockholder approval 
these warrants were initiall y exercisable for an aggregate of  shares 
the exercisable warrants were valued using the black scholes model resulting in a charge of approximately million to deferred stock based compensation 
on february   our stockholders voted against the proposed financing  which resulted in us terminating the share purchase agreement and caused the warrants to become exercisable with respect to all  shares 
the warrants were exercisable for two years from the date the share purchase agreement was terminated 
the warrants expired unexercised 
using the black scholes model  the warrants issue d in november that were initially exercisable were re valued as of february   and the warrants that became exercisable on february  were valued as of such date  resulting in a charge totaling approximately million which was reflected as amortization of stock based compensation in the first quarter of in november  we issued to our landlords warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at per share in connection with an amendment to our existing facility lease 
the warrants were valued using the black scholes model which resulted in a charge of approximately  which was accounted for as a reduction to our restructuring liability in the fourth quarter of the warrant was exercised in november in december  we issued to a customer warrants to purchase up to  fully vested shares of common stock at per share in connection with a marketing agreement 
the warrants were valued at approximately  using the black scholes model 
this amount was accounted for as a reduction of revenu e in the fourth quarter of as of december   a total of approximately million of unearned deferred stock based compensation remained to be amortized 
we anticipate stock based compensation expense to approximate from to million in  and the remainder in the amortization of stock based compensation for and  by operating expense  is detailed as follows i n thousands year ended december cost of service sales and marketing   research and development   general and administrative  total   amortization of identifiable intangibles 
the amortization of identifiable intangible assets recorded in the current and prior year relates to million of purchased technology recorded as an intangible asset in connection with the merger with silknet in april the amortization of these assets concluded in april amortization during totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
restructuring costs 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in restructuring costs related to a change in evaluation of real estate market conditions in the united kingdom  and changes in sublease estimates based on communication from current and potential subtenants in the united states 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million in restructuring cost savings related to an amendment to a facility lease  our evaluation of real estate market conditions relating to this and other excess leased facilities  and discussions with our other landlords 
the following table summarizes our restructuring expenses  payments  and liabilities at and for the years ended december  and in thousands fixed as set severance facilities disposa ls totals restructuring reserve at restructuring charge    non cash reduction of restructuring   payments made   restructuring reserve at  non cash reduction of restructuring  payments made  sublease payments received restructuring reserve at  restructuring charge  payments made  sublease payments received restructuring reserve at  we expect payments relating to restructuring liabilities to approximate million in  net of contractual sublease payments  with the remainder being paid fairly evenly from until during and  we did not incur any restructuring costs related to personnel 
during and  we realized personnel related costs savings associated with reductions in headcount as a result of our restructuring in  of approximately million in each year 
cost savings in relating to facilities reductions from our restructuring in included  in sublease payments received and million in reduced rent obligations relating to an amendment in to a facility lease 
cost savings in relating to facilities reductions from our restructuring in included  in sublease payments received and  in reduced rent obligations relating to the lease amendment in reductions in rent obligations related to this amendment ranged from approximately million in  increasing to approximately million in to the extent we are able to sublease excess facilities sooner than anticipated  or for greater dollar amounts than assumed  we will experience further cost reductions 
likewise  to the extent that our sublease expectations are not met  we may experience adjustments to our restructuring reserve in future periods that may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 
goodwill impairment 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment under certain circumstances and written down when impaired 
sfas requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
under the transition provisions of sfas no 
 there was no goodwill impairment at january  based upon our analysis at that time 
however  during the quarter ended june   circumstances developed that indicated the goodwill was likely impaired and we performed an impairment analysis as of june  this analysis resulted in a million impairment expense to reduce goodwill 
the circumstances that led to the impairment included the lower than previously expected revenues and net loss for the second quarter of and the revision of estimates of our revenues and net loss for subsequent quarters  based upon financial results for the second quarter of and the reduction of estimated cash flows in future quarters 
we used a combination of discounted cash flows and relevant market data  including our market capitalization during the period following the revision of estimates  to calculate an estimated fair value and the resulting goodwill impairment 
the estimated fair value was compared to the corresponding carrying value of goodwill at june   which resulted in a revaluation of goodwill as of june  during the three months ended june  we performed our annual test for goodwill impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
we currently operate in one reportable segment  which is also the only reporting unit for the purposes of sfas we completed our evaluation as of june  and concluded that goodwill was not impaired as the fair value of our company exceeded its carrying value  including goodwill 
there have been no events or circumstances from june  to december  that have affected our june  conclusion regarding the recoverability of goodwill 
the remaining amount of goodwill as of december  was million 
any further impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of investment in connection with the merger with silknet in april  we assumed a million investment in preferred stock of a privately held company 
we recorded a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of and another million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in order to reduce the carrying value of the investment to zero at december  the impairment charge in was based upon the decline in the estimated fair value of the asset based upon evaluation of the business prospects 
the impairment charge in was based on a substantial decline in the estimated fair value of the investment based  in part  on the terms of a recent financing involving significant new investors 
other income expense  net other income expense  net consists of interest income  interest expense and other income expense 
interest income consisted primarily of interest earned on cash and short term investments and was approximately  and  during the years ended december  and the decrease in other income expense  net related to lower amounts of interest income earned due to lower average interest rates and cash balances in than in interest expense consisted primarily of interest expense related to our line of credit and was approximately  and  during the years ended december  and other income consisted primarily of net gains on asset disposals 
provision for income taxes we have incurred operating losses on a consolidated basis for all periods from inception through december  accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our gross deferred tax assets  as the future realization of the tax benefit is not currently likely 
in  certain foreign entities were profitable  based upon application of our intercompany transfer pricing agreements  which resulted in us reporting income tax expense totaling approximately  in those foreign jurisdictions 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards  if not offset against future taxable income  will expire from through pursuant to the internal revenue code  the amounts and benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
events which cause limitations in the amount of net operating losses that we may utilize in any one year include  but are not limited to  a cumulative ownership change of more than  as defined  over a three year period 
as such  the portion of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards subject to potential expiration has not been included in deferred tax assets 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as part of the adoption of sfas no 
on january   unamortized negative goodwill was to be immediately recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle 
accordingly  approximately million was eliminated and reported as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the year ended december  additionally  under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized 
accordingly  amortization of goodwill ceased as of january comparison of the years ended december  and revenues total revenues decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of decreased service revenues 
license revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for this increase in license revenue was primarily due to an increase in the average selling price of license deals  particularly in europe  as well as sales of products formerly offered by broadbase  which were not included in our revenues prior to the june merger license revenues recorded by broadbase through june totaled million 
the increase in the average selling price of license deals reflected the growth in our sales to larger organizations that often license our applications for more users and that need more functionality 
we believe this growth resulted  in significant part  from our increased use of indirect channels to market and sell our products  which allow us to market our products more effectively to global organizations 
in addition  we believe the introduction of our kana icare suite in  with its deployment and integration advantages  has facilitated sales of licenses for multiple applications to our customers resulting in larger transaction sizes than those involving a stand alone application 
one customer accounted for of our total revenues in our license revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue mostly due to the reduction in our professional services personnel resulting from a shift in our strategy beginning in september to encourage our customers to increase their use of independent third party integrators to provide implementation services  rather than purchase those services from us 
service revenues decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for service revenues decreased primarily due to our customers increased use of independent third party integrators for implementation services as discussed above 
revenues from international sales were million  or of total revenues  in the year ended december  and million  or of total revenues  in the year ended december  the increase in international sales in is primarily as a result of sales through our integration partner in the united kingdom 
our international revenues were derived from sales in europe  canada  asia pacific and latin america 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenue for was compared to in the slight increase was due to greater sales of certain licenses in  which had higher associated royalty rates 
cost of service revenues decreased to of service revenues for compared to for the prior year 
cost of service revenues in included approximately million  or of service revenues  related to a loss contract with a customer  as discussed in reserve for loss contract under critical accounting policies above 
the improvement in service margins was primarily due to the change in service revenues mix following a shift in our strategy to have customers increase their use of independent third party integrators to provide implementation services  rather than purchase those services from us 
as a result  support revenues comprised a larger percentage of service revenues  which have yielded better margins than professional services revenues since the ratio of customers to kana personnel is significantly higher for customer support 
support revenues comprised million  or of total revenues in  compared to million  or in operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in sales and marketing personnel since the second half of  which reduced sales and marketing related positions from positions as of june  to positions at december   and related decreases in benefits  travel  and facility costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable primarily to the reduction of personnel since the second half of  which reduced research and development related positions from as of june  to at december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to the reduction in bad debts charged to general and administrative expenses  from million in to approximately  in this decrease was also attributable to the reduction of personnel since the second half of  which reduced finance  legal and human resources related positions from as of june  to at december  amortization of stock based compensation 
as of december   a total of approximately million of unearned deferred stock based compensation remained to be amortized

there were no merger related costs incurred in in connection with the merger with broadbase  we recorded million of merger related expenses in the merger costs included personnel costs of million  and million relating to duplicate facility and insurance costs  redundant assets  and professional fees associated with the merger 
as of december   no accrued merger related costs remained on the consolidated balance sheet 
restructuring costs 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million in restructuring cost savings related to an amendment to a facility lease  our evaluation of real estate market conditions relating to this and other excess leased facilities  and discussions with our other landlords 
for the year ended december   we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million primarily related to reductions in our workforce and costs associated with certain excess leased facilities and asset impairments 
the restructuring charges included million for assets disposed of or removed from operations 
assets disposed of or removed from operations consisted primarily of computer equipment and related software  office equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements 
the restructuring charge in also included million for severance  benefits and related costs associated with reductions in our workforce 
we restructured our organization throughout  with net workforce reductions of approximately employees  or from december   in order to streamline operations  eliminate redundant positions after the merger with broadbase  reduce costs and bring our staffing and cost structure in line with industry standards and current economic conditions 
the restructuring charge in also included million resulting from our decision to exit and reduce some of our facilities 
the estimated facility costs were based on our contractual obligations  net of estimated sublease income  based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets

as discussed under comparison of the years ended december  and above  on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under the transition provisions of sfas no 
 there was no goodwill impairment at january  based upon our analysis at that time 
however  during the quarter ended june   circumstances developed that indicated the goodwill was likely impaired and we performed an impairment analysis as of june  this analysis resulted in a million impairment expense to reduce goodwill 
the remaining goodwill balance was approximately million at december  in  we performed an impairment assessment of the identifiable intangibles and goodwill recorded in connection with the silknet merger 
the assessment was performed primarily due to the significant sustained decline in our stock price since the valuation date of the shares issued in the silknet acquisition which had resulted in the net book value of our assets prior to the impairment charge significantly exceeding our market capitalization  the overall decline in the industry growth rates  and our lower than projected operating results 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in the first quarter of to reduce our goodwill 
the charge was based upon the estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the goodwill using a discount rate of 
impairment of investment in connection with the merger with silknet in april  we assumed a million investment in preferred stock of a privately held company 
we recorded a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in order to reduce the carrying value of the investment to  the impairment charge was based on a substantial decline in the estimated fair value of the investment based  in part  on the terms of a recent financing involving significant new investors 
this investment is included under other assets in our consolidated balance sheet at december  other income expense  net other income expense  net in and consisted primarily of interest earned on cash and short term investments offset by interest expense related to our line of credit and other non operating expenses such as gains and losses on asset disposals 
other income expense  net was  for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease in other income expense  net related to lower amounts of interest income earned due to lower average cash balances in than in provision for income taxes we have incurred operating losses in each year since inception 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our gross deferred tax assets  as the future realization of the tax benefit is not currently likely 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards  if not offset against future taxable income  will expire from through pursuant to the internal revenue code  the amounts and benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
events which cause limitations in the amount of net operating losses that we may utilize in any one year include  but are not limited to  a cumulative ownership change of more than  as defined  over a three year period 
the portion of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards subject to potential expiration has not been included in deferred tax assets 
discontinued operation during the second quarter of  we adopted a plan to discontinue the kana online business 
we no longer seek any new kana online business or have any remaining contractual obligations to provide kana online to customers 
accordingly  kana online is reported as a discontinued operation 
the estimated loss on the disposal of kana online recorded during the second quarter of was million  consisting of an estimated loss on disposal of the business of million and a provision of million for the anticipated operating losses during the phase out period 
the loss on disposal was recorded in the second quarter of and adjusted in the second quarter of  resulting in a gain of  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million as of december  as of december   we had working capital of million 
history and recent trends 
we have had negative cash flows from operations in each year since inception 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through issuances of common stock and  to a lesser extent  cash acquired in acquisitions 
however  our cash used in operations has decreased significantly in recent years  from million in to million in to million in this reduction in operating cash outflows is a result of a decrease in overall cost of revenues  sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  and merger and restructuring costs from to  offset in part  by a decrease in revenues during the same period 
our cost reductions have been realized through our restructuring plan in  as well as various cost controls and operational efficiencies realized since in  and  we had net workforce reductions of approximately   and employees  respectively 
of the workforce reductions in  related to the shift to the outsourcing of our development activities to our development partners with staffing overseas 
we do not expect further reductions in research and development expense based upon our outsourcing activities  since we will invest approximately the same amount as in recent quarters of we have experienced modest improvements in operating cash flows in the second half of and expect the trend to continue if our revenue expectations are met 
however  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be indicative of our future performance 
primary driver of cash flow 
our ability to generate cash in the future relies upon our success in generating sufficient sales transactions  especially new license transactions 
we expect our maintenance renewals in to grow slightly from since our new license transactions are relatively small in volume and are difficult to predict  we may not be able to generate new license transactions as anticipated in any particular future period 
from time to time  changes in working capital will affect our cash flows 
however  we do not expect this to materially impact our future cash flows over time  since we expect relative stability  or slight increases  in our assets and liabilities 
operating cash flow 
our use of million of cash for operating activities for the year ended december   included a million net loss from continuing operations offset by non cash charges of million in depreciation  million in amortization of deferred stock based compensation and million in amortization of identifiable intangibles 
operating activities also included million in net payments relating to restructuring liabilities 
other working capital changes totaled a net million  resulting primarily from a million decrease in accounts receivable  offset by a million reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts  million reduction in deferred revenue and million reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
our operating activities used million of cash for the year ended december  and million of cash for the year ended december  these expenditures were primarily attributable to net losses experienced during these periods  offset in part by non cash charges related to impairment of goodwill and amortization of intangibles and stock based compensation 
investing cash flow 
our investing activities provided million of cash for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of net transfers of short term investments to cash totaling million  offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
our investing activities provided million of cash for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of reductions of restricted cash of million  net transfers of short term investments to cash totaling million  offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
our investing activities provided million of cash for the year ended december   which was primarily due transfers of short term investments and cash acquired from the acquisition of broadbase  offset by purchases of property and equipment of million  and a transfer of million of cash to restricted cash 
our purchases of property and equipment have decreased from to  from million in to million in the decrease is due to the reduction in purchases of infrastructure and various employee related equipment in  as well as the completion of million in expenditures on internal use software as of january we expect our capital needs in to be relatively consistent with financing cash flow 
our financing activities provided million in cash for the year ended december   due to net proceeds from issuances of common stock and warrants  particularly the public offering in november which raised million in net proceeds 
our financing activities provided million in cash for the year ended december   primarily due to net proceeds of approximately million from our private placement of approximately million shares of our common stock in february our financing activities provided million in cash for the year ended december   primarily due to net proceeds of million from a private placement of approximately million shares of our common stock 
existence and timing of contractual obligations 
we have a line of credit totaling million  which is collateralized by all of our assets  bears interest at the bank s prime rate as of december   and expires in november at which time the entire balance under the line of credit will be due 
total borrowings as of december  and were million under this line of credit 
the line of credit requires that we maintain at least a million dollar balance in any account at the bank or pay a one time fee of  the line of credit also requires that we maintain at all times a minimum of million as short term unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and investments that mature within twelve months 
if we default under this line of credit  including through a violation of any of these covenants  the entire balance under the line of credit will become immediately due and payable 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants of the line of credit agreement 
future payments due under debt and lease obligations and other contractual commitments as of december  are as follows in thousands obligations obligations under under non cancelable line of outsourcing capital operating year ending december  credit agreements leases leases total thereafter represents minimum payments to one vendor providing outsourced software programming  quality assurance and technical documentation activities in india 
the agreement is cancelable with days notice and a fee of  if notice is given by kana prior to may  or  if notice is given prior to august  future payments due under non cancelable operating leases are shown net of future sublease income and includ es leases previously subject to abandonment and included in the restructuring charge 
as of december   our estimate of accrued restructuring cost includes an assumption of receiving million in sublease payments that are not yet under contractual arrangement  and in most cases  a potential sublesso r has not been identified 
we have assumed that the majority of these sublease payments will begin in through  and continue through the end of the related lease 
significant expected cash outflows in addition to our operating expenses through include approximately million in lease payments  net of contracted sublease payments  relating to accrued restructuring costs and approximately million of minimum payments to one vendor providing outsourced software programming  quality assurance and technical documentation activities in india 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals gaap  none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our balance sheet 
the vast majority of our operating leases relat e to facilities and do not involve a transfer of ownership at the end of the lease 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
cash held in foreign locations 
as of december   we had million in us equivalent dollars held by our owned foreign subsidiaries  primarily in europe and japan 
we believe our access to this cash is unencumbered  and would not result in withholding or repatriation charges due t o our intercompany receivable balances and transfer pricing arrangements with these entities 
outlook 
based on our current revenue expectations  we expect our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs through december  however  if we experience a decrease in demand for our products from the level experienced in the second half of  then we would need to reduce expenditures 
our expectations as to our future cash flows and our future cash balances are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regardin g anticipated increases in our revenue  improvements in general economic conditions and customer purchasing and payment patterns  many of which are beyond our control 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin r revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no

fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
fin  which was issued in january before concluding that it is appropriate to apply arb voting interest consolidation model to a n entity  an enterprise must first determine that the entity is not a variable interest entity vie 
as of the effective date of fin r  an enterprise must evaluate its involvement with all entities or legal structures created before february   to determine whether consolidation requirements of fin r apply to those entities 
there is no grandfathering of existing entities 
public companies must apply either fin or fin r immediately to entities created after december  and no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  for all other entities 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity

it requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in balance sheets 
the guidance in sfas is generally effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified afte r may   and otherwise became effective on july  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows o r results of operations 
risk factors we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing business environment that involves substantial risks and uncertainty  including but not limited to the specific risks identified below 
the risks described below are not the only one s facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may become important factors that impair our busines s operations 
any of these risks could cause  or contribute to causing  our actua l results to differ materially from expectations 
prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this report and our other public filings 
our failure to complete our expected sales in any given quarter could materially harm our operating results because of the relatively large size of many of our orders 
our quarterly revenues are especially subject to fluctuation because they depend on the completion of relatively large orders for our products and relate d services 
the average size of our license transactions is generally large relative to our total revenue in any quarter  particularly as we have focused o n larger enterprise customers and on licensing our more comprehensive integrated products and have involved system integrators in our sales process 
in part as a result of this aspect of our business  our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet the expectation s of investors and public market analysts  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
for example  during the year ended december   one customer  ibm  represented of our total revenues 
this dependence on large orders makes our net revenue and operating results more likely to vary from quarter to quarter  and more difficult to predict  because the loss of any particular large order is significant 
as a result  our operating results could suffer if any large orders are delayed or canceled in any future period 
in addition  large orders  and orders obtained through the activities of system integrators  often have longer sales cycles  increasing the difficulty of predicting future revenues 
we expect the concentration of revenues among fewer customers to continue in the future 
our dependence on large orders for our operating results in any given quarter makes us vulnerable to prospective customers budgetary timelines and constraints 
contributing to the risk that anticipated sales may not occur on expected time frame  if at all  our sales cycle is subject to a number of significant risks  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews  over which we have little or no control 
due to the slowdown in the general economy over the past few years  we believe that many existing and potential customers have reassessed and reduced their planned technology and software investments and are deferring purchasing decisions  requiring additional evaluations and levels of internal approval for software investment and lengthening their purchase cycles 
further delays or reductions in business spending for information technology could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
consequently  if sales expected from a specific customer in a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  we are unlikely to be able to generate revenue from alternate sources in time to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result  and due to the relatively large size of a typical order  a lost or delayed sale could result in revenues that are lower than expected 
moreover  to the extent that significant sales occur earlier than anticipated  revenues for subsequent quarters may be lower than expected 
consequently  we face difficulty predicting the quarter in which sale s to expected customers will occur  which contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 
in recent periods  we have experienced increases in the length of a typical sales cycle 
this trend may add to the uncertainty of our future operating results and reduce our ability to anticipate our future revenues 
we may not be able to forecast our revenues accurately because our products have a long and variable sales cycle 
the long sales cycle for our products may cause license revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
to date  the sales cycle for our products has taken anywhere from to months 
furthermore  selling our products in conjunction with our systems integrators who are proposing thei r implementation services of our products can involve a particularly long sales cycle  as it typically takes more time for the prospective customer to evaluate proposals from multiple vendors 
consequently  we face difficulty predicting th e quarter in which expected sales will actually occur 
this contributes to fluctuations in our future operating results 
our sales cycle has required pre purchase evaluation by a significant number of individuals in our customers organizations 
along with third parties that often jointly market our software with us  we invest significant amounts of time and resources educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits o f our products 
many of our customers evaluate our software slowly and deliberately  depending on the specific technical capabilities of the customer  the size of the deployment  the complexity of the customer s network environment  and the quantity of hardware and the degree of hardware configuration necessary to deploy our products 
the present economic downturn has led to a significant increase in the time required for this process and if the downturn continues  the sales cycle for our products may become even longer and we may require more resources to complete sales 
our expenses are generally fixed and we will not be able to reduce these expenses quickly if we fail to meet our revenue expectations 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our forecast is based  in part  upon our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if total revenues fo r a particular quarter are below expectations  we could not proportionately reduc e operating expenses for that quarter 
accordingly  such a revenue shortfall woul d have a disproportionate effect on our expected operating results for that quarter 
if our international development partners do not provide us with adequate support  our ability to respond to competition and customer demands would be impaired  and our results of operations would be harmed 
in the first quarter of  we began subcontracting a significant portion of our software programming  quality assurance and technical documentation activities to development partners with staffing in india and china 
we have little prior experience in outsourcing our product development work  and we cannot be sure that this strategy will succeed or that it will not cause us difficulties in responding to development challenges we may face 
the operation s of these partners are based outside the us and therefore subject to risks distinct from those that face us based operations 
for example  military action or political upheaval in the host countries could force these partners t o terminate the services they are providing to us or to close their operations entirely 
if these partners fail  for any reason  to provide adequate and timel y product enhancements  updates and fixes to us  our ability to respond to customer or competitive demands would be harmed and we would lose sales opportunities and customers 
in addition  the loss of research and development personnel associated with this strategy will cause us to lose internal expertise  reducing our ability to respond to these demands independently if th e partners fail to perform as required 
in the year ended december   we reduced the size of our research and development department by employees 
we have estimated our operating costs for making various assumptions about th e amount that we will need to pay our development partners 
based on our limited history of working with these partners  we cannot be sure that our cost estimates will prove correct 
unanticipated increases in our operating expenses in any given quarter would increase our net losses and could require us to obtain additional financing sooner than expected 
if we fail to generate sufficient revenues to support our business and require additional financing  failure to obtain such financing would affect our ability to maintain our operations and to grow our business  and the terms of any financing we obtain may impair the rights of our existing stockholders 
in the future  we may be required to seek additional financing to fund our operations or growth  and such financing may not be available to us  or may impair the rights of our existing stockholders 
our operating activities used million of cash in failure to increase future orders and revenues beyond the level achieved in the second and third quarters of would likely require us to seek additional capital to meet our working capital needs if we are unable to reduce expenses to the degree necessary to avoid incurring losses factors such as the commercial success of our existing products and services  the timing and success of any new products and services  the progress of our research and development efforts  our results of operations  the status of competitive products and services  and the timing and success of potential strategic alliances or potential opportunities to acquire or sell technologies or assets may require us to seek additional funding sooner than we expect 
in the event that we require additional cash  we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us  especially in the uncertain market climate  and we may not be successful in implementing or negotiating such other arrangements to improve our cash position 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced and the securitie s we issue might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
if adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to achieve or sustain positive cash flows  maintain current operations  fund any potential expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance products or services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
because we have a limited operating history  there is limited information upon which you can evaluate our business 
we first recorded revenue in february and our revenue mix and operating structure have changed substantially since then 
thus  we have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects 
due t o our limited operating history and significant changes in our business over the past four years  it is difficult or impossible to predict our future results of operations 
for example  we cannot accurately forecast operating expenses based on our historical results or those of similar companies because historical results are limited and reflect different products  costs and business models  and we forecast expenses in part on future revenue projections based on a numbe r of assumptions 
moreover  due to our limited operating history and evolving product offerings  our insights into trends that may emerge and affect our business are limited 
we have a history of losses and may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
since we began operations in  our revenues have not been sufficient to support our operations  and we have incurred substantial operating losses in every quarter 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately billion  which includes approximately billion related t o goodwill impairment charges 
we continue to commit a substantial investment of resources to sales  product marketing  and developing new products and enhancements  and we will need to increase our revenue to achieve profitability and positive cash flows 
our expectations as to when we can achieve positive cash flows  and as to our future cash balances  are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding improvements in general economic conditions and customer purchasing and payment patterns  many of which are beyond our control 
our history of losses has previously caused some of our potential customers to question our viability  which has in turn hampered our ability to sell some of our products 
additionally  our revenue has been affected by the uncertain economic conditions in recent years  both generally and in our market 
as a result of these conditions  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience difficulties in attracting new customers  whic h means that we may continue to experience losses  even if sales of our products and services grow 
we rely on marketing  technology and distribution relationships for the sale  installation and support of our products that may generally be terminated at any time  and if our current and future relationships are not successful  ou r growth might be limited 
we rely on marketing and technology relationships with a variety of companies  including systems integrators and consulting firms that  among other things  generate leads for the sale of our products and provide our customers with implementation and ongoing support 
if we cannot maintain successful marketing and technology relationships or if we fail to enter into additional such relationships  we could have difficulty expanding the sales of our product s and our growth might be limited 
a significant percentage of our revenues depend on leads generated by systems integrators  or si s  and their recommendations of our products  and we expect an increasing percentage of our revenues to be derived from our relationships with sis that market and sell our products 
if sis do not successfully market our products  our operating results will be materially harmed 
in addition  many of our direct sales are to customers that will be relying on sis to implement our products  and if sis are not familiar with our technology or able to successfully implement our products  our operating result s will be materially harmed 
we expect to continue building our network of sis an d other indirect sales channels and  if this strategy is successful  our dependence on the efforts of these third parties for revenue growth and custome r service will increase 
our reliance on third parties for these functions will reduce our control over such activities and reduce our ability to perform such functions internally 
if we come to rely primarily on a single si that subsequently terminates its relationship with us  becomes insolvent or is acquired by another company with which we have no relationship  or decides not to provide implementation services related to our products  we may not be able to internally generate sufficient revenue or increase the revenues generated by our other si relationships to offset the resulting lost revenues 
furthermore  sis typically suggest our solution in combination with other products and services  some of which may compete with our solution 
sis are not required to promote any fixed quantities of our products  are not bound to promote our products exclusively  and may act as indirect sales channels for our competitors 
if these companies choose not to promote our products or if they develop  market or recommend software applications that compete with our products  our business will be harmed 
in addition  we rely on distributors  value added resellers  systems integrators  consultants and other third party resellers to recommend our products and to install these products 
our reduction in the size of our professional services team in increased our customers reliance on third parties for product installations and support 
if the companies providing these services fail to implement our products successfully for our customers  we migh t be unable to complete implementation on the schedule required by the customers and we may have increased customer dissatisfaction or difficulty making future sales as a result 
we might not be able to maintain these relationships and enter into additional relationships that will provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
if we cannot maintain successful relationships with our indirect sales channel partners  we might have difficulty expanding th e sales of our products and our growth could be limited 
in addition  if such third parties do not provide the support our customers need  we may be required to hire subcontractors to provide these professional services 
increased use of subcontractors would harm our margins because it costs us more to hire subcontractors to perform these services than to provide the services ourselves 
recent reductions in workforce may adversely affect our ability to release products and product updates in a timely manner 
we have substantially reduced our headcount in from a total of employees as of december  to as of december  the majority of this reduction was the result of our decision to shift a significant portion of our software programming  quality assurance and technical documentation activities to international development partners in early we reduced the size of our research and development department by employees in the year ended december  our outsourcing plan may yield unanticipated consequences  such as an inability to release products within expected timeframes 
for example  many of the employees who were terminated possessed specific knowledge or expertise that may prove to have been important to our operation 
as a result of these staff reductions  our ability to respond to unexpected challenges may be impaired and we may be unable to take advantage of new opportunities 
personnel reductions may also subject us to the risk of litigation  which may adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations an d may cause us to incur significant expense 
we may be unable to hire and retain the skilled personnel necessary to develop and grow our business 
our reductions in force and salary levels may reduce employee morale and may create concern among existing employees about job security  which could lead to increased turnover and reduce our ability to meet the needs of our current and future customers 
as a result of the reductions in force  we may also need to increase our staff to support new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers 
because our stock price declined drastically in recent years  and has not experienced any sustained recovery from the decline  stock based compensation  including options to purchase our common stock  may have diminished effectiveness as employee hiring and retention devices 
if we are unable to retain qualified personnel  we could face disruptions to operations  loss of key information  expertise or know how and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs 
if employee turnover increases  our ability to provide customer service and execute our strategy would be negatively affected 
for example  our ability to increase revenues in the future depends considerably upon our success in recruiting  training and retaining effective direct sales personnel and the success of our direct sales force 
we might not be successful in these efforts 
our products and services require sophisticated sales efforts 
we have experienced significant turnover in our sales force  including the departure of our vice president of sales in october furthermore  there is a shortage of sales personnel with the requisite qualifications  and competition for such qualified personnel is intense in our industry 
also  it may take a new salesperson a number of months to become a productive member of our sales force 
our business will be harmed if we fail to hire or retain qualified sales personnel  or if newly hired salespeople fail to develop the necessary sales skills or develop these skills more slowly than anticipated 
we face substantial competition and may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for our products and services is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
from time to time  some of our competitors have reduced the prices of their products and services substantially in certain cases in order to obtain new customers 
competitive pressures could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers and could require us to reduce the price of our products 
our customers requirements and the technology available to satisfy those requirements are continually changing 
therefore  we must be able to respond to these changes in order to remain competitive 
if our international development partners do not adequately perform the software programming  quality assurance and technical documentation activities we outsourced  we may not be able to respond to such changes as quickly or effectively 
changes in our products may also make it more difficult for our sales force to sell effectively 
in addition  changes in customers demand for the specific products  product features and services of other companies may result in our products becoming uncompetitive 
we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against curren t and future competitors  and competitive pressures may seriously harm our business 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of products and services offered 
we currently face competition for our products from systems designed by in house and third party development efforts 
we expect that these systems will continue to be a major source of competition for the foreseeable future 
our primary competitors for ecrm platforms are larger  more established companies such as siebel systems  inc and peoplesoft  inc  and to a lesser extent  oracle and sap 
we also face competition from e 
piphany  inc  chordian t software  inc  primus knowledge solutions  and astute  inc 
with respect to specific applications we offer 
we may face increased competition upon introduction of new products or upgrades from competitors  or if we expand our product line through acquisition of complementary businesses or otherwise 
as w e have combined and enhanced our product lines to offer a more comprehensive e business software solution  we are increasingly competing with large  established providers of customer management and communication solutions as wel l as other competitors 
our combined product line may not be sufficient to successfully compete with the product offerings available from these companies  which could slow our growth and harm our business 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  significantly greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we have 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers and have extensive knowledge of our industry 
we may lose potential customers to competitors for various reasons  including the ability or willingness of competitors to offer lower prices and other incentives that we cannot match 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we also expect that competition will increase as a result of recent industry consolidations  as well as anticipated future consolidations 
if we fail to respond to changing customer preferences in our market  demand for our products and our ability to enhance our revenues will suffer 
if we do not continue to improve our products and develop new products that keep pace with competitive product introductions and technological developments satisfy diverse and rapidly evolving customer requirements and achieve market acceptance  we might be unable to attract new customers 
the development of proprietary technology and necessary service enhancements entails significant technical and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead time 
in addition  if our international development partners fail to provide th e development support we need  our products and product documentation could fall behind those produced by our competitors  causing us to lose customers and sales 
we might not be successful in marketing and supporting recently released versions of our products  or developing and marketing other product enhancement s and new products that respond to technological advances and market changes  on a timely or cost effective basis 
in addition  even if these products are developed and released  they might not achieve market acceptance 
we have experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements in the past and could experience similar delays in the future 
these delays or problem s in the installation or implementation of our new releases could cause us to los e customers 
failure to develop new products or enhancements to existing products on a timely basis would hurt our sales and damage our reputation 
the challenges of developing new products and enhancements require us to commit a substantial investment of resources  and we might not be able to develop or introduce new products on a timely or cost effective basis  or at all  which could be exploited by our competitors and lead potential customers t o choose alternative products 
to be competitive  we must develop and introduce o n a timely basis new products and product enhancements for companies with significant e business customer interactions needs 
our ability to deliver competitive products may be negatively affected by the diversion of resources t o development of our suite of products  and responding to changes in competitive products and in the demands of our customers 
if we experience product delays i n the future  we may face customer dissatisfaction  cancellation of orders and license agreements  negative publicity  loss of revenues  slower market acceptance  and legal action by customers 
furthermore  delays in bringing new products or enhancements to market can result  for example  from potential difficulties with managing outsourced research and development  including overseeing such activities occurring in india and china or from loss of institutional knowledge through reductions in force  or the existence of defects in new products or their enhancements 
our stock price has been highly volatile and has experienced a significant decline  and may continue to be volatile and decline 
the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and is expected to continue to do so in the future  as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  such as variations in our actual and anticipated operating results  changes in our earnings estimates by analysts  the volatility inherent in stock prices within the emerging sector within which we conduct business  and the volume of trading in our common stock  including sales of substantial amounts of common stock issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants 
in addition  stock markets in general  and particularly the nasdaq national market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many technology and computer software companies  particularly internet related companies 
such fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
securities class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
since becoming a publicly traded security listed on nasdaq in september  our common stock has reached a closing high of  per share and closing low of per share 
the last reported sale price of our shares on march  was per share 
under nasdaq s listing maintenance standards  if the closing bid price of our common stock is under per share for consecutive trading days  nasdaq may choose to notify us that it may delist our common stock from the nasdaq national market 
if the closing bid price of our common stock did not thereafter regain compliance for a minimum of consecutive trading days during the days following notification by nasdaq  nasdaq could delist our common stock from trading on the nasdaq national market 
there can be no assurance that our common stock will remain eligible for trading on the nasdaq national market 
if our stock were delisted  the ability of our stockholders to sell any of our common stock at all would be severely  if not completely  limited  causing our stock price to continue to decline 
we depend on increased business from new customers  and if we fail to grow our customer base or generate repeat business  our operating results could be harmed 
our business model generally depends on the sale of our products to new customers as well as on expanded use of our products within our customers organizations 
if we fail to grow our customer base or generate repeat and expanded business from our current and future customers  our business and operating results will be seriously harmed 
in some cases  our customers initially make a limited purchase of our products and services for pilot programs 
these customers may not purchase additional licenses to expand their use of our products 
if these customers do not successfully develop and deploy initial applications based on our products  they may choose not to purchase deployment licenses or additional development licenses 
in addition  as we introduce new versions of our products or new product lines  our current customers might not require the functionality of our new products and might not ultimately license these products 
furthermore  because the total amount of maintenance and support fees we receive in any period depends in large part on the size and number of licenses that we have previously sold  any downturn in our software license revenue would negatively affect our future services revenue 
also  if customers elect not to renew their maintenance agreements  our services revenue could decline significantly 
if customers were unable to pay for their current products or are unwilling to purchase additional products  our revenues would decline 
our failure to manage multiple technologies and technological change could reduce demand for our products 
rapidly changing technology and operating systems  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards might impede market acceptance of our products 
our products are designed based upon currently prevailing technology to work on a variety of hardware and software platforms used by our customers 
however  our software may not operate correctly on evolving versions of hardware and software platforms  programming languages  database environments and other systems that our customers use 
if new technologies emerge that are incompatible with our products  or if competing products emerge that are based on new technologies or new industry standards and that perform better or cost less than our products  our key products could become obsolete and our existing and potential customers could seek alternatives to our products 
we must constantly modify and improve our products to keep pace with changes made to these platforms and to database systems and other back office applications and internet related applications 
furthermore  software adapters are necessary to integrate our products with other systems and data sources used by our customers 
we must develop and update these adapters to reflect changes to these systems and data sources in order to maintain the functionality provided by our products 
as a result  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications by vendors of operating systems  databases  customer relationship management software  web servers and other enterprise and internet based applications could delay our product development  increase our product development expense or cause customers to delay evaluation  purchase and deployment of our analytics products 
furthermore  if our international development partners fail to respond adequately when adaptation of our products is required  our ability to respond would be hampered even if such uncertainties were eliminated 
if we fail to modify or improve our products in response to evolving industry standards  our products could rapidly become obsolete 
failure to license necessary third party software incorporated in our products could cause delays or reductions in our sales 
we license third party software that we incorporate into our products 
these licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
some of this technology would be difficult to replace 
the loss of any such license could result in delays or reductions of our applications until we identify  license and integrate or develop equivalent software 
if we are required to enter into license agreements with third parties for replacement technology  we could face higher royalty payments and our products may lose certain attributes or features 
in the future  we might need to license other software to enhance our products and meet evolving customer needs 
if we are unable to do this  we could experience reduced demand for our products 
our pending patents may never be issued and  even if issued  may provide little protection 
our success and ability to compete depend to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology rights 
we currently have four issued us patents  three of which expire in and one of which expires in  and multiple us patent applications pending relating to our software 
none of our technology is patented outside of the united states 
it is possible that our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights  any issued patents could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties  which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the inventions claimed in those patents  current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any of our patents  and effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which we do business 
we rely upon trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights  which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property 
we also rely on a combination of laws  such as copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and contractual restrictions  such as confidentiality agreements and licenses  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
however  despite the precautions that we have taken laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technologies  current federal laws that prohibit software copying provide only limited protection from software pirates  and effective trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries  other companies may claim common law trademark rights based upon state or foreign laws that precede the federal registration of our marks  and policing unauthorized use of our products and trademarks is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and we may be unable to determine the extent of this unauthorized use 
also  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it  which would significantly harm our business 
we may become involved in litigation over proprietary rights  which could be costly and time consuming 
the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents  trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows 
our technologies may not be able to withstand any third party claims or rights against their use 
some of our competitors in the market for customer communications software may have filed or may intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology that they may claim our technology infringes 
such competitors could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our products and technology 
third parties may currently have  or may eventually be issued  patents upon which our current or future products or technology infringe 
any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us 
for example  from time to time  companies have asked us to evaluate the need for a license of certain patents 
although as of march   there are no outstanding patent infringement claims against us  we cannot assure you that no such claims will be filed in the future 
other companies may also have pending patent applications which are typically confidential until the patent or patents  if any  are issued that cover technologies we incorporate in our products 
in addition  many of our software license agreements require us to indemnify our customers from any claim or finding of intellectual property infringement 
we periodically receive notices from customers regarding patent license inquiries they have received which may or may not implicate our indemnity obligations 
any litigation  brought by others  or us could result in the expenditure of significant financial resources and the diversion of management s time and efforts 
in addition  litigation in which we are accused of infringement might cause product shipment delays  require us to develop non infringing technology or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements  which might not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost effective basis  our business could be significantly harmed 
we may face higher costs and lost sales if our software contains errors 
we face the possibility of higher costs as a result of the complexity of our products and the potential for undetected errors 
due to the mission critical nature of many of our products and services  errors could be particularly problematic 
in the past  we have discovered software errors in some of our products after their introduction 
we have only a few beta customers that test new features and functionality of our software before we make these features and functionalities generally available to our customers 
if we are not able to detect and correct errors in our products or releases before commencing commercial shipments  we could face loss of or delay in revenues expected from the new product and an immediate and significant loss of market share  loss of existing customers that upgrade to the new product and of new customers  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers  and increased insurance costs 
our security could be breached  which could damage our reputation and deter customers from using our services 
we must protect our computer systems and network from physical break ins  security breaches and other disruptive problems caused by the internet or other users 
computer break ins could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network  which could adversely affect our ability to retain or attract customers  damage our reputation and subject us to litigation 
we have been in the past  and could be in the future  subject to denial of service  vandalism and other attacks on our systems by internet hackers 
although we intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent break ins  damage and failures  these security measures may fail 
our insurance coverage in certain circumstances may be insufficient to cover losses that may result from such events 
we may face liability claims that could result in unexpected costs and damages to our reputation 
our licenses with customers generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  such as disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages 
in addition  our license agreements generally cap the amounts recoverable for damages to the amounts paid by the licensee to us for the product or service giving rise to the damages 
however  some domestic and international jurisdictions may not enforce these contractual limitations on liability 
we may be subject to claims based on errors in our software or mistakes in performing our services including claims relating to damages to our customers internal systems 
a product liability claim could divert the attention of management and key personnel  could be expensive to defend and could result in adverse settlements and judgments 
our international operations expose us to additional risks 
a substantial proportion of our revenues is generated from sales outside north america  exposing us to additional financial and operational risks 
sales outside north america represented of our total revenues  of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in we have established offices in the united kingdom  germany  japan  the netherlands  france  belgium  hong kong and south korea 
sales outside north america could increase as a percentage of total revenues as we attempt to expand our international operations 
in addition to the additional costs and uncertainties of being subject to international laws and regulations  any expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources  as well as additional support personnel 
for any such expansion  we will also need to  among other things expand our international sales channel management and support organizations and develop relationships with international service providers and additional distributors and system integrators 
in addition  if international operations become a larger part of our business  we could encounter  on average  greater difficulty with collecting accounts receivable  longer sales cycles and collection periods  greater seasonal reductions in business activity and increases in our tax rates 
furthermore  products must be localized  or customized to meet the needs of local users  before they can be sold in particular foreign countries 
developing localized versions of our products for foreign markets is difficult and can take longer than we anticipate 
international laws and regulations may expose us to potential costs and litigation 
our international operations increase our exposure to international laws and regulations 
if we cannot comply with foreign laws and regulations  which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes  we could incur unexpected costs and potential litigation 
for example  the governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our products and services or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
in addition  foreign countries may impose tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers  any of which could make it more difficult for us to conduct our business 
the european union has enacted its own privacy regulations that may result in limits on the collection and use of certain user information  which  if applied to the sale of our products and services  could negatively impact our results of operations 
we may suffer foreign exchange rate losses 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in local currency 
therefore  a weakening of other currencies compared to the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and could negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 
we have not yet experienced  but may in the future experience  significant foreign currency transaction losses  especially because we generally do not engage in currency hedging 
as the international component of our revenues grows  our results of operations will become more sensitive to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
if we acquire companies  products or technologies  we may face risks associated with those acquisitions 
we recently acquired hipbone  inc and if we are presented with appropriate opportunities  we may make other investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the hipbone acquisition or any other acquisition or investment 
if we acquire another company  we will likely face risks  uncertainties and disruptions associated with the integration process  including  among other things  difficulties in the integration of the operations  technologies and services of the acquired company  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 
if we fail to successfully integrate other companies that we may acquire  our business could be harmed 
also  acquisitions can expose us to liabilities and risks facing the company we acquire  including lawsuits or claims against the company that are unknown at the time of the acquisition 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any additional future acquisitions or investments  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or us 
for example  in the hipbone acquisition we issued approximately  shares of our common stock 
in addition  our operating results may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization expenses or charges relating to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
the role of acquisitions in our future growth may be limited  which could seriously harm our continued operations 
in the past  acquisitions have been an important part of the growth strategy for us 
to gain access to key technologies  new products and broader customer bases  we have acquired companies in exchange for shares of our common stock 
because the recent trading prices of our common stock have been significantly lower than in the past  the role of acquisitions in our growth may be substantially limited 
if we are unable to acquire companies in exchange for our common stock  we may not have access to new customers  needed technological advances or new products and enhancements to existing products 
this would substantially impair our ability to respond to market opportunities 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of the company 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock 
without any further vote or action on the part of the stockholders  the board of directors has the authority to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock 
this preferred stock  if issued  might have preference over and harm the rights of the holders of common stock 
although the issuance of this preferred stock will provide us with flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  this issuance may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we currently have no plans to issue preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and equity compensation plans include provisions that may deter an unsolicited offer to purchase us 
these provisions  coupled with the provisions of the delaware general corporation law  may delay or impede a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
furthermore  our board of directors is divided into three classes  only one of which is elected each year 
directors are removable by the affirmative vote of at least of all classes of voting stock 
these factors may further delay or prevent a change of control of us 
risks related to our industry future regulation of the internet may slow our growth  resulting in decreased demand for our products and services and increased costs of doing business 
state  federal and foreign regulators could adopt laws and regulations that impose additional burdens on companies that conduct business online 
these laws and regulations could discourage communication by e mail or other web based communications  particularly targeted e mail of the type facilitated by our products  which could reduce demand for our products and services 
the growth and development of the market for online services may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws or laws that may inhibit the use of internet based communications or the information contained in these communications 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the expansion of the internet 
a decline in the growth of the internet  particularly as it relates to online communication  could decrease demand for our products and services and increase our costs of doing business  or otherwise harm our business 
any new legislation or regulations  application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business  or application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and other online services could increase our costs and harm our growth 
the imposition of sales and other taxes on products sold by our customers over the internet could have a negative effect on online commerce and the demand for our products and services 
the imposition of new sales or other taxes could limit the growth of internet commerce generally and  as a result  the demand for our products and services 
federal legislation that limited the imposition of state and local taxes on internet related sales until november  has expired 
congress is currently considering whether to approve either a permanent or a two year extension of the limits 
however  they may choose not to pass the new legislation  in which case state and local governments would be free to impose taxes on electronically purchased goods 
we believe that most companies that sell products over the internet do not currently collect sales or other taxes on shipments of their products into states or foreign countries where they are not physically present 
however  one or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on out of jurisdiction companies that engage in e commerce within their jurisdiction 
a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that companies that engage in e commerce within their jurisdiction should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of their products over the internet  even though not physically in the state or country  could indirectly reduce demand for our products 
privacy concerns relating to the internet are increasing  which could result in legislation that negatively affects our business in reduced sales of our products 
businesses using our products capture information regarding their customers when those customers contact them on line with customer service inquiries 
privacy concerns could cause visitors to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our software products most effectively 
more importantly  even the perception of privacy concerns  whether or not valid  may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our products 
in addition  legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten these concerns if businesses must notify web site users that the data captured after visiting certain web sites may be used by marketing entities to unilaterally direct product promotion and advertising to that user 
if consumer privacy concerns are not adequately resolved  our business could be harmed 
government regulation that limits our customers use of this information could reduce the demand for our products 
a number of jurisdictions have adopted  or are considering adopting  laws that restrict the use of customer information from internet applications 
the european union has required that its member states adopt legislation that imposes restrictions on the collection and use of personal data  and that limits the transfer of personally identifiable data to countries that do not impose equivalent restrictions 
in the united states  the childrens online privacy protection act was enacted in october this legislation directs the federal trade commission to regulate the collection of data from children on commercial websites 
in addition  the federal trade commission has investigated the privacy practices of businesses that collect information on the internet 
these and other privacy related initiatives could reduce demand for some of the internet applications with which our products operate  and could restrict the use of these products in some e commerce applications 
this could  in turn  reduce demand for these products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell these products in north america  europe  asia  australia and latin america 
in the year ended december   revenues from customers outside of the united states approximated of total revenues 
generally  our sales are made in the local currency of our customers 
as a result  our financial results and cash flows could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
we rarely use derivative instruments to hedge against foreign exchange risk 
as such  we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  principally from the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and british pound 
we manage exposure to variability in foreign currency exchange rates primarily due to the fact that liabilities and assets  as well as revenues and expenses  are denominated in the local currency 
however  different durations in our funding obligations and assets may expose us to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we have not entered into any derivative instrument transactions to manage this risk 
based on our overall foreign currency rate exposure at december   we do not believe that a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we do not consider our cash equivalents or short term investments to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities
