item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s revenues are derived primarily from restaurant sales from company owned longhorn steakhouse  the capital grille  and bugaboo creek steak house restaurants 
the company also derives a small percentage of its total revenue from two company owned specialty restaurants and franchise revenues from three franchised longhorn steakhouse restaurants 
cost of restaurant sales consists of food and beverage costs for all restaurants other than the three franchised longhorn steakhouse restaurants 
operating expenses restaurants consist of other costs incurred by the company to operate its restaurants  including the cost of labor  advertising  operating supplies  rent  and utilities 
depreciation and amortization restaurants includes the depreciation attributable to restaurant level capital expenditures 
the depreciation and amortization relating to non restaurant level capital expenditures is included in general and administrative expenses 
preopening costs include direct and incremental costs such as payroll  food and beverage costs  and trainer payroll and travel expenses incurred prior to opening of new restaurants 
general and administrative expenses include restaurant supervision expenses  accounting  finance  management information systems and other administrative overhead related to support functions for company owned  joint venture  and franchise restaurant operations 
interest expense  net includes interest on capital lease obligations and amortization of loan issue costs partially offset by capitalized construction period interest and interest income 
minority interest consists of the partner s share of earnings in the three longhorn steakhouse restaurants that are operated as joint venture restaurants 
the company s management believes in the importance of building incremental top line sales at each restaurant to support the longer term profitability of the company 
the change in year over year sales for the comparable restaurant base is referred to as same store sales 
the company defines the comparable restaurant base to include those restaurants open for a full months prior to the beginning of each fiscal quarter 
same store sales increases can be generated by an increase in guest traffic counts guest counts or by increases in guest average check amount average check 
the average check can be affected by menu price changes and the mix of menu items sold menu mix 
the company gathers sales data daily and regularly analyzes the guest counts and menu mix for each concept to assist in developing menu pricing  product offering and promotion strategies 
management believes that increases in guest counts are an indication of the long term health of a concept  while increases in average check and menu mix contribute more significantly to current period profitability 
the company works to balance the pricing and product offerings with other initiatives to achieve the long term goal of sustainable increases in same store sales 
average weekly sales are defined as total restaurant sales divided by restaurant weeks 
a restaurant week is one week during which a single restaurant is open  so that two restaurants open during the same week constitutes two restaurant weeks 
growth in average weekly sales includes the effect of newer restaurants that are not yet included in the same store sales base 
growth in average weekly sales in excess of growth in same store sales is generally an indication that newer restaurants are operating with sales levels in excess of the system average 
conversely  growth in average weekly sales less than growth in same store sales is generally an indication that newer restaurants are operating with sales levels lower than the system average 
it is not uncommon in the casual dining industry for new restaurant locations to open with an initial honeymoon period of higher than normalized sales volumes and then to experience a drop off in sales after initial customer trials 
the incremental sales generated as a result of increases in same store sales make a significant contribution to the company s profitability 
many restaurant level expenses are relatively fixed in nature and do not increase at the same rate as same store sales increases 
with sales increasing and certain restaurant level expenses staying fixed or semi variable rising more slowly than incremental sales  the incremental sales measured by these same store sales increases should be the company s most profitable 
when new restaurants are opened  there are preopening costs and certain relatively fixed costs including expense items such as management labor  rent and depreciation that must be absorbed 
additionally  it generally takes some period of time after opening before restaurant margins normalize 
accordingly  the sales at newly opened restaurants do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation 
the company s revenues and expenses can be affected significantly by the number and timing of the opening of additional restaurants 
for instance  preopening expenses for any particular period may reflect expenses associated with restaurants to be opened in future periods  in addition to those restaurants opened during the current period 
the timing of restaurant openings also can affect the average weekly sales and other period to period comparisons

during  average weekly sales increased at a rate slightly less than the increase in same store sales 
the capital grille restaurants have historically opened at lower sales volumes and not experienced the drop off in sales after an initial honeymoon period commonly characteristic in casual dining restaurant concepts 
accordingly  sales volumes at the company s two new the capital grille restaurants opened during had the impact of reducing average weekly sales for the overall concept

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the company adopted sfas effective as of the beginning of fiscal year sfas requires that an intangible asset that is acquired shall be initially recognized and measured based on its fair value 
this statement also provides that goodwill should not be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company ceased amortization of goodwill and performed the required goodwill impairment testing 
the impairment test required the company to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value to determine whether there is an indication that an impairment may exist 
if an impairment of goodwill is determined to exist  it is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
upon performing the initial test of the carrying value of the company s goodwill  it was concluded that there was no current indication of impairment to goodwill 
accordingly  no impairment losses were recorded upon the initial adoption of sfas as of the date of adoption  the company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of approximately million 
amortization expense related to goodwill was approximately million for fiscal year in accordance with sfas  no goodwill amortization expense was recorded in the company s financial statements for or for the foreseeable future  management believes the only impact on the company s consolidated financial statements from the adoption of sfas will be the elimination of goodwill amortization expense

discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the company s capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or software or closing of facilities could also result in shortened useful lives 
the company s accounting policies regarding property and equipment include judgments by management regarding the estimated useful lives of these assets  the residual values to which the assets are depreciated  and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact the company s need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including restaurant sites  fixed assets  intangibles and goodwill are reviewed by the company for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
expected cash flows associated with an asset is a key factor in determining the recoverability of the asset 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
the company s estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  the company recognizes an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the company s ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause the company to realize a material impairment charge 
in  the company recognized a  charge for the writedown of one longhorn steakhouse restaurant and in recognized a  charge for the writedown of five longhorn steakhouse restaurants based on an evaluation of expected cash flows 
self insurance reserves the company self insures for a significant portion of expected losses under its workers compensation  employee medical  employment practices and general liability programs 
accrued liabilities have been recorded based on estimates of the ultimate costs to settle incurred and incurred but not reported claims 
the accounting policies regarding self insurance programs include certain management judgments and assumptions regarding the frequency or severity of claims and claim development patterns  and claim reserve  management  and settlement practices 
unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for by the company in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company reviews and assesses the recoverability of any deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provides any necessary allowances as required 
an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made
