introduction business overview we are a dry van truckload carrier based in phoenix  arizona 
we transport general commodities for shippers throughout the united states  generally focusing our operations on short to medium lengths of haul 
we provide regional truckload carrier services from our operating divisions located throughout the united states 
over the past five years we have achieved substantial revenue and income growth 
during this period  our revenue  before fuel surcharge  grew at a compounded annual rate from million in to million in  and our net income grew at a compounded annual rate from million in to million in operating and growth strategy our operating strategy is focused on the following core elements o focusing on regional operations 
we seek to operate primarily in high density  predictable traffic lanes in selected geographic regions 
we believe our regional operations allow us to obtain greater freight volumes and higher revenue per mile  and also enhance safety and driver recruitment and retention 
o maintaining operating efficiencies and controlling costs 
we focus almost exclusively on operating dry vans in distinct geographic and shipping markets in order to achieve increased penetration of targeted service areas and higher equipment utilization in dense traffic lanes 
we actively seek to control costs by  among other things  operating a modern equipment fleet  maintaining a high driver to non driver employee ratio  and regulating vehicle speed 
o providing a high level of customer service 
we seek to compete on the basis of service in addition to price  and offer our customers a broad range of services to meet their specific needs  including multiple pick ups and deliveries  on time pick ups and deliveries within narrow time frames  dedicated fleet and personnel  and specialized driver training 
o using technology to enhance our business 
our tractors are equipped with a satellite based tracking and communications system to permit us to stay in contact with our drivers  obtain load position updates  and provide our customers with freight visibility 
the majority of our trailers are equipped with tracking technology to allow us to manage our trailers more effectively  maintain a low trailer to tractor ratio  efficiently assess detention fees  and minimize cargo loss 
the primary source of our revenue growth has been our ability to open new regional facilities in certain geographic areas and operate these facilities at a profit 
during  we established presences in atlanta  georgia and denver  colorado  and opened a regional facility in las vegas  nevada in february based on our current expectations concerning the economy  we anticipate opening two additional regional facilities in and adding to new tractors system wide during the year 
as part of our growth strategy  we also periodically evaluate acquisition opportunities and we will continue to consider acquisitions that meet our financial and operating criteria 
revenue and expenses we primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile for our services 
we enhance our revenue by charging for tractor and trailer detention  loading and unloading activities  and other specialized  as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the general level of economic activity in the united states  inventory levels  specific customer demand  the level of capacity in the trucking industry  and driver availability 
going forward  the recently effective revised hours of service regulations could have a negative impact on our miles per truck if they reduce the amount of time that our drivers spend driving 
to the extent we are not able to offset any such impact through the collection of fees from shippers who retain our equipment or drivers  our revenue would be adversely affected 
for much of the past three years  economic activity in the united states has been somewhat sluggish  which has limited to some extent our ability to obtain rate increases 
during the second half of  however  the united states economy experienced strong growth  which many forecasters anticipate will continue throughout business inventory levels also improved in late we believe that if the economy continues to improve and inventory levels continue to increase  we should experience stronger and more stable freight demand among current and prospective customers in than we experienced in   and the first half of historically  the excess capacity in the transportation industry has limited our ability to improve rates 
over the past two years  the transportation industry has seen some reduction in capacity 
we believe that the factors described above contributed to the year over year improvement in our average revenue per mile in we hope that in  lower capacity coupled with stronger freight demand will continue to provide us with better pricing power 
the main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and owner operator costs  which are recorded under purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs are the acquisition and financing of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and operating terminals and the compensation of non driver personnel 
effectively controlling our expenses is an important element of assuring our profitability 
the primary measure we use to evaluate our profitability is operating ratio  excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge 
we view any operating ratio  whether for the company or any operations center  in excess of as unacceptable performance 
recent results of operations and year end financial condition for the year ended december   our results of operations improved as follows versus the fiscal year o revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased  to million from million  o net income increased  to million from million  and o net income per diluted share increased to from 
during the fourth quarter of  we added approximately new tractors and experienced a temporary challenge attracting a sufficient number of drivers to optimize utilization of our expanded tractor fleet 
in response to this challenge  we placed additional emphasis on our driver recruiting and retention efforts 
this emphasis on recruiting and retention  coupled with one cent per mile increases in driver compensation implemented in september and january  which will affect our costs going forward  have resulted in nearly all of our trucks being fully seated at this time 
we invested significant time and resources training our driver and non driver personnel and communicating with our customers in preparation for the effectiveness of the new hours of service rules on january  we are currently operating under the new rules  and have experienced minimal disruption in our operations to date 
although it is too early to ascertain the ultimate impact of the new rules  based on our initial experience  our preliminary expectation is that they will not materially affect our results of operations 
see business regulation  above 
at december  our balance sheet reflected million in cash and investments  no long term debt  after paying off the remaining million balance on our line of credit during the fourth quarter of  and shareholders equity of million 
for the year  we generated million in cash flow from operations and used million for net capital expenditures  producing million in free cash flow 
based on our recent historical results  we expect our operations to continue to fund growth and generate free cash flow  absent any significant acquisitions 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  net 
both measures used to compute free cash flow are set forth in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 
management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the company s ability to generate cash for purposes such as reinvesting in our business and making acquisitions 
free cash flow does not  however  take into account debt service requirements  if any  and other non discretionary expenditures and therefore may not necessarily be indicative of amounts of cash available for discretionary uses 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  and not in lieu of  net cash provided by  or used in  operating  investing  or financing activities  net income  and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
risks associated with our business we operate in an economic and legal environment that involves many different risks 
these risks range from such unpredictable matters as the impact of new dot revised hours of service regulations to continued unrest in the middle east to general economic conditions and the pace of overall economic growth 
we have described below  a number of these risks 
see factors that may affect future results  below 
we expect that we will continue to be subject to these risks and to other risks that we have not anticipated 
we will continue to rely upon our employees and upon our operating strategy to address these risks as best we can and we will continue to work towards delivering value to our shareholders 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of our expense items to total revenue and revenue  before fuel surcharge  for each of the three fiscal years indicated below 
fuel expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  is calculated using fuel expense  net of surcharge 
management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
total revenue revenue  before fuel surcharge operating expenses operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits fuel fuel operations and maintenance operations and maintenance insurance and claims insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses operating taxes and licenses communications communications depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization lease expense revenue lease expense revenue equipment equipment purchased transportation purchased transportation miscellaneous operating miscellaneous operating expenses expenses total operating expenses total operating expenses income from operations income from operations net interest and other expense net interest and other expense income before income taxes income before income taxes income taxes income taxes net income net income net of fuel surcharge 
includes a pre tax  non cash write off of  in relating to an investment in terion  inc a discussion of our results of operations for the periods to and to is set forth below 
fiscal compared to fiscal our total revenue for increased to million from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in the period and million of fuel surcharge revenue in the period 
in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge  and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe the high variable cost nature of our business makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased by to million in from million in this increase primarily resulted from the expansion of our customer base and increased volume from existing customers  that was facilitated by a continued growth of our tractor and trailer fleet  which increased by to  tractors including owned by independent contractors as of december   from  tractors including owned by independent contractors as of december  in addition  our average revenue per mile exclusive of fuel surcharge increased to per mile for  from per mile for the same period in salaries  wages and benefits expense decreased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in from in  primarily due to the improved efficiencies in the company s personnel operations  improved utilization of revenue equipment  and a larger revenue base over which these largely fixed expenses were spread 
as of december   of our fleet was operated by company drivers  compared to as of december  for our drivers  we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claims accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  decreased  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  to for from in  due mainly to improved collection of fuel surcharge revenue during  which more than offset higher fuel prices 
the company maintains a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs 
for the year ended december   fuel surcharge was million  compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of total revenue  including fuel surcharge  fuel expense increased to for from in as a result of higher fuel prices 
we believe that higher fuel prices may continue to adversely affect our operating expenses throughout  and that continued unrest in the middle east could have a significant adverse effect on fuel prices 
see factors that may affect future results if fuel prices increase significantly  our results of operations could be adversely affected  below 
we have entered into fuel hedging agreements as a means of managing the cost of our fuel 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity price risk  below 
operations and maintenance expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for from in this increase was primarily due to the slight aging our fleet 
independent contractors pay for the maintenance on their own vehicles 
insurance and claims expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for  compared to for  primarily as a result of an increase in insurance premiums and higher self insurance retention levels assumed by the company 
see business safety risk management  above 
operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for from for the increase resulted primarily from an increase in miles run in higher tax rate states  along with increased licensing rates in certain states  for the month period ended december  communications expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained relatively constant at for both and depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  increased to for from in this increase was primarily related to an increase in the percentage of our company fleet comprised of purchased vehicles 
at december   of our company fleet was comprised of purchased vehicles  compared to at december  our company fleet includes purchased vehicles and vehicles acquired under operating leases  while our total fleet includes vehicles in our company fleet as well as vehicles provided by independent contractors 
lease expense for revenue equipment as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for  primarily as a result of a decrease in the percentage of the company fleet comprised of vehicles held under operating leases 
several of our operating lease agreements have variable payment terms that are amortized on a straight line basis 
purchased transportation expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained relatively constant at and for and  respectively 
as of december   of our fleet was operated by independent contractors  compared to at december  as of december   our total fleet included tractors owned and operated by independent contractors  compared to tractors owned and operated by independent contractors at december  purchased transportation represents the amount an independent contractor is paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed upon per mile basis 
to assist us in continuing to attract independent contractors  we may provide financing to qualified independent contractors to assist them in acquiring revenue equipment 
as of december   we had  in loans outstanding to independent contractors to purchase revenue equipment 
these loans are secured by liens on the revenue equipment we finance 
miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for from in  primarily due to increases in revenue per mile as well as increases in overall revenue which spread these generally fixed costs over greater revenue 
as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for net interest expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained at less than for both and we reduced our outstanding debt to at december   compared to million at december  other expense for was comprised of an adjustment to the carrying value of an investment the company has in an entity whose primary asset is a jet aircraft 
other expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
our effective tax rate declined from in to for as a result of state tax planning strategies 
income tax expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  from for  primarily due to the overall decrease in our operating ratio 
as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in fiscal compared to fiscal revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased by to million in from million in this increase primarily resulted from the expansion of our customer base and increased volume from existing customers  that was facilitated by a continued growth of our tractor and trailer fleet  which increased by to  tractors including owned by independent contractors as of december   from  tractors including owned by independent contractors as of december  additionally  our average revenue per mile exclusive of fuel surcharge increased to per mile for  from per mile in salaries  wages and benefits expense decreased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in from in  primarily due to the improved efficiencies in the company s personnel operations  improved utilization of revenue equipment  and a larger revenue base over which these largely fixed expenses were spread

fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for from in  due mainly to lower collection of fuel surcharge revenue during compared to  along with the increase in the percentage of our fleet comprised of company vehicles as opposed to vehicles provided by independent contractors  from in to in these factors were partially offset by lower average fuel prices in compared to the company maintains a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs 
for the year ended december   fuel surcharge was million  compared to million for the same period in as a result of lower fuel prices 
as a percentage of total revenue  including fuel surcharge  fuel expense remained relatively constant at for and for  as lower fuel prices in were offset by lower collection of fuel surcharge revenue during that year 
operations and maintenance expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for from in this increase was primarily due to a slight aging of the company s fleet  along with the increase in the ratio of company operated vehicles to independent contractor operated vehicles 
independent contractors pay for the maintenance on their own vehicles 
insurance and claims expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for  compared to for  primarily as a result of the increase in insurance premiums and an increase in the frequency of claims experienced by the company 
operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for from for the decrease resulted primarily from a relative increase in miles run in lower tax rate states and an increase in equipment utilization for communications expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained relatively consistent at and for and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  increased to for from in this increase was primarily related to the increase in the percentage of our company fleet comprised of purchased vehicles 
at december   of our company fleet was comprised of purchased vehicles  compared to at december  our company fleet includes purchased vehicles and vehicles acquired under operating leases  while our total fleet includes vehicles in our company fleet as well as vehicles provided by independent contractors 
lease expense for revenue equipment as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to for several of our operating lease agreements have variable payment terms that are amortized on a straight line basis 
purchased transportation expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to in from in  primarily as a result of a decrease in the percentage of our total fleet comprised of independent contractors as opposed to company drivers 
as of december   of our fleet was operated by independent contractors  compared to at december  as of december   the company had tractors owned and operated by independent contractors  compared to tractors owned and operated by independent contractors at december  purchased transportation represents the amount an independent contractor is paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed per mile basis 
to assist us in continuing to attract independent contractors  we provide financing to qualified independent contractors to assist them in acquiring revenue equipment 
as of december   we had million in loans outstanding to independent contractors to purchase revenue equipment 
these loans are secured by liens on the revenue equipment we finance 
miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for from in  primarily due to decreased travel expenses and increases in equipment utilization 
as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for net interest and other expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for from for  excluding the write off in of our million investment in terion  inc this decrease was primarily the result of the company s ability to reduce its outstanding debt to approximately million at december   compared to million at december  debt reduction was facilitated  in part  by proceeds obtained from the public offering of our common stock that closed november  also  our interest income was higher in compared to due to a higher average cash balance in income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
our effective tax rate was remained relatively constant at for and for income tax expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  from for  primarily due to the recording of the non recurring charge of our investment in terion in  as discussed below  along with a change in the mix of state tax liabilities 
as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in this percentage was for  excluding the write off of our investment in terion  as discussed below 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a non recurring charge of million to record the write off of our entire investment in terion  inc terion  a communications technology company  that we made during and we owned less than four percent of terion and did not derive any revenue from our investment 
we elected to write off our investment for financial accounting purposes after terion announced that it would cease operating its on cab communications system 
in january  terion filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws 
the impact on earnings per diluted share was for the year ended december  this write off resulted in a reduction of net income  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  of for the fiscal year ended december  liquidity and capital resources the growth of our business has required  and will continue to require  a significant investment in new revenue equipment 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations  and to a lesser extent lease financing arrangements  issuances of equity securities  and borrowings under our line of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase for was primarily the result of an increase in revenue coupled with an improvement in our operating ratio  an increase in claims reserve balances resulting from higher self insurance levels  and improvements made in our collection of accounts receivable 
capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment  net of trade ins  office equipment  land and leasehold improvements  totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures  net of trade ins  of approximately million for we expect these capital expenditures will be applied primarily to acquire new revenue equipment 
net cash used for financing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used for financing during these periods was primarily for the payments on our line of credit and long term debt  which was retired in full during the fourth quarter of net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the net proceeds of an underwritten stock offering  partially offset by principal and interest payments on debt 
at december   we did not have any borrowing outstanding 
we currently maintain a line of credit  which permits revolving borrowings and letters of credit totaling million 
at december   the line of credit consisted solely of issued but unused letters of credit totaling million 
historically this line of credit had been maintained at million 
however  due to our continued strong positive cash position  and in an effort to minimize bank fees  we do not believe a revolving credit facility or term loans are necessary to meet our current and anticipated near term cash needs 
we believe any necessary increase in our line of credit to provide for a revolving line or credit or term loans could be accomplished quickly as needed 
we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under our line of credit and were in compliance with these covenants at december   and as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents 
management believes we will be able to finance our near term needs for working capital over the next twelve months  as well as acquisitions of revenue equipment during such period  with cash balances  cash flows from operations  and borrowings and operating lease financing believed to be available from financing sources 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  which may require us to incur debt or seek additional equity capital 
the availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock and several other factors over which we have limited control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
nevertheless  based on our recent operating results  current cash position  anticipated future cash flows  and sources of financing that we expect will be available to us  we do not expect that we will experience any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet transactions our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
like many other trucking companies  historically we have utilized non cancelable operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment acquisitions 
at december   we leased tractors under operating leases with varying termination dates ranging from january to april vehicles held under operating leases are not carried on our balance sheet  and lease payments in respect of such vehicles are reflected in our income statements in the line item lease expense revenue equipment 
our rental expense related to operating leases was million in  compared to million in the total amount outstanding under operating leases as of december   was million  with million due in the next months 
the effective annual interest rates under these operating leases range from to 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of december   our contractual obligations and payments due by corresponding period for our short and long term operating expenses  including operating leases and other commitments 
contractual obligations payments in thousands due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations    purchase obligations revenue equipment   total    operating lease obligations consists of amounts due under non cancelable operating leases for the leasing of certain revenue equipment 
purchase obligations revenue equipment represents the total purchase price under commitments to purchase tractors and trailers scheduled for delivery throughout net of estimated trade in values  the estimated amount due under these commitments is approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management 
revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue upon delivery of a shipment 
depreciation 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is calculated by the straight line method over the useful life of the property or equipment  which ranges from five to thirty years  with salvage values ranging from to 
we periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our property and equipment based upon  among other things  our experience with similar assets  including gains or losses upon dispositions of such assets 
claims reserves and estimates 
reserves and estimates for claims is another of our critical accounting policies 
the primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  collision and comprehensive  workers compensation  and employee medical expenses 
we maintain self insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self insured liabilities 
we also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self insurance amounts 
the claims reserves represent accruals for the estimated uninsured portion of pending claims  including adverse development of known claims  as well as incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates are based on historical information  primarily our own claims experience and the experience of our third party administrator  along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
the significant recent increases in our self insured retention for personal injury and property damage claims  from  in to million currently  amplify the importance and potential impact of these estimates 
estimates also are involved in other aspects of our business 
for instance  we make similar types of estimates concerning the collectibility of our accounts receivable and the concentration of our credit exposure based on our historical experience and certain assumptions about future events 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as certain tax credit carryovers  will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to the company s profitable operations 
accordingly  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
we continually evaluate strategies that would allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets and currently believe we have the ability to enact strategies to fully realize our deferred tax assets should our earnings in future periods not support the full realization of the deferred tax assets 
seasonality in the transportation industry  results of operations frequently show a seasonal pattern 
seasonal variations may result from weather or from customer s reduced shipments after the busy winter holiday season 
to date  our revenue has not shown any significant seasonal pattern 
because we operate significantly in arizona  california and the western united states  winter weather generally has not adversely affected our business 
continued expansion of our operations in the midwest  rocky mountain area  east coast  and the southeast could expose us to greater operating variances due to seasonal weather in these regions 
shortages of energy and related issues in california  and elsewhere in the western united states  could result in an adverse effect on our operations and demand for our services if these shortages continue or increase 
this risk may also exist in other regions in which we operate  depending upon availability of energy

the changes noted in sab no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results our future results may be affected by a number of factors over which we have little or no control 
fuel prices  insurance and claims costs  liability claims  regulatory requirements that may increase costs or decrease efficiency  including revised hours of service requirements for drivers  the availability of qualified drivers  interest rates  fluctuations in the resale value of revenue equipment  economic and customer business cycles and shipping demands are factors over which we have little or no control 
significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates or insurance costs or liability claims  and increases in costs of compliance with  or decreases in efficiency resulting from  regulatory requirements  to the extent not offset by fuel surcharges and increases in freight rates  as well as downward changes in the resale value of revenue equipment  could reduce our profitability 
weakness in the general economy  including a weakness in consumer demand for goods and services  could adversely affect our customers and our growth and revenues  if customers reduce their demand for transportation services 
weakness in customer demand for our services or in the general rate environment may also restrain our ability to increase rates or obtain fuel surcharges 
it is also not possible to predict the effects of terrorist attacks and subsequent events on the economy or on customer confidence in the united states  or the impact  if any  on our future results of operations 
the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our business and growth outlook 
our growth may not continue at historic rates we have experienced significant and rapid growth in revenue and profits since the inception of our business in there can be no assurance that our business will continue to grow in a similar fashion in the future or that we can effectively adapt our management  administrative  and operational systems to respond to any future growth 
further  there can be no assurance that our operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic conditions 
ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels  which could reduce our earnings 
during  we were self insured for personal injury and property damage liability  cargo liability  collision and comprehensive up to a maximum limit of million per occurrence up from million per occurrence in our maximum self retention for workers compensation where a traffic accident is not involved remained constant in at  per occurrence 
for  we have retained our maximum self retention for personal injury and property damage liability  cargo liability  collision  and comprehensive at million per occurrence 
we maintain insurance with licensed insurance companies above the amounts for which we self insure 
our insurance policies for provided for excess personal injury and property damage liability up to a total of million per occurrence and cargo liability  collision  comprehensive and workers compensation coverage up to a total of million per occurrence 
subsequent to december   the million in excess coverage per occurrence for personal injury and property damage has been increased to million 
our personal injury and property damage policies also include coverage for punitive damages where such coverage is allowed 
if the number of claims for which we are self insured increases  our operating results could be adversely affected 
after several years of aggressive pricing in the s  insurance carriers raised premiums and sought higher self insurance retention levels  which increased our insurance and claims expense 
the terrorist attacks of september   exacerbated already difficult conditions in the united states insurance market resulting in additional increases in our insurance expenses 
if these costs continue to increase  or if the severity or number of claims increase  and if we are unable to offset the resulting increases in expenses with higher freight rates  our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
increased prices for  or increased costs of operating  new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment may materially and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
our growth has been made possible through the addition of new revenue equipment 
difficulty in financing or obtaining new revenue equipment for example  delivery delays from manufacturers or the unavailability of independent contractors could restrict future growth 
we currently have fixed amount repurchase  trade in  or residual agreements with equipment manufacturers covering the substantial majority of our tractor fleet and a considerable portion of our trailer fleet 
in some cases  we are required to purchase a specified quantity of replacement equipment from the manufacturer in order to obtain the benefit of these agreements 
current developments in the secondary tractor and trailer resale market have resulted in a large supply of used tractors and trailers on the market 
this has depressed the market value of used equipment to levels  in some cases significantly below the prices at which the manufacturers have agreed to repurchase the equipment 
accordingly  some manufacturers may refuse or be financially unable to keep their commitments to repurchase equipment according to the terms of our agreements with them 
if manufacturers refuse or unable to meet their obligations under our agreements with them  or if we decline to purchase the specified number of replacement units from the manufacturers  we may suffer a financial loss upon the disposition of our equipment  and could be forced to write down the value of our used equipment 
the epa recently adopted new emissions control regulations  which require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through  for engines manufactured in october and thereafter 
in part to offset the costs of compliance with the new epa engine design requirements  some manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices and eliminated or sharply reduced the price of repurchase or trade in commitments 
if new equipment prices were to increase  or if the price of repurchase commitments by equipment manufacturers were to decrease  more than anticipated  we may be required to increase our depreciation and financing costs and or retain some of our equipment longer  with a resulting increase in maintenance expenses 
to the extent we are unable to offset any such increases in expenses with rate increases or cost savings  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
additionally  the cost of operating the new epa compliant engines is expected to be somewhat higher than the cost of operating engines manufactured prior to october   due primarily to lower anticipated fuel efficiency and potentially higher maintenance expenses 
if our fuel or maintenance expenses were to increase as a result of our use of the new  epa compliant engines  and we are unable to offset such increases with fuel surcharges or higher freight rates  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
further  our business and operations could be adversely impacted if we experience problems with the reliability of the new engines 
we began operating tractors with engines meeting the epa guidelines during although we have not experienced any significant reliability issues with these engines to date  the expenses associated with the tractors containing these engines have been slightly elevated  primarily as a result lower fuel efficiency and slightly higher depreciation 
if fuel prices increase significantly  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are subject to risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside our control 
political events in the middle east  venezuela and elsewhere may also cause the price of fuel to increase 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of short term increases in fuel prices from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always fully offset the increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
if the growth in our regional operations throughout the united states slows or stagnates  or if we are unable to commit sufficient resources to our regional operations  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
currently  a significant portion of our business is concentrated in the arizona and california markets 
a general economic decline or a natural disaster in either of these markets could have a materially adverse effect on our growth and profitability 
if we are not able to continue our successful growth and expansion into the midwest  south central  southeastern and southern regions  and on the east coast  our growth and profitability could be materially and adversely affected by general economic declines or natural disasters in those markets 
in addition to our regional facility in phoenix  arizona  we have established regional operations in salt lake city  utah  portland  oregon  denver  colorado  kansas city  kansas  katy  texas  indianapolis  indiana  charlotte  north carolina  gulfport  mississippi  memphis  tennessee  atlanta  georgia  and las vegas  nevada  in order to serve markets in these regions 
these regional operations require the commitment of additional revenue equipment and personnel  as well as management resources  for future development 
should the growth in our regional operations throughout the united states slow or stagnate  the results of our operations could be adversely affected 
we may encounter operating conditions in these new markets that differ substantially from those previously experienced in our western united states markets 
there can be no assurance that our regional operating strategy  as employed in the western united states  can be duplicated successfully in the other areas of the united states or that it will not take longer than expected or require a more substantial financial commitment than anticipated 
our operations are subject to various governmental regulations which limit our business and the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 
the dot and various state and local agencies exercise broad powers over our business  generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  and insurance requirements 
the dot adopted revised hours of service regulations for drivers on april  that became effective on january  the revised regulations could reduce the potential or practical amount of time that drivers can spend driving  if we are unable to limit their other on duty activities 
these changes could adversely affect our profitability if shippers are unwilling to assist us in managing the drivers non driving activities  such as loading  unloading  and waiting 
if these changes reduce our miles per truck or increase our costs and these effects are not offset by higher rates or the collection of detention or other charges  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the dot  including those relating to drug and alcohol testing 
we also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to ergonomics or other matters 
in addition to direct regulation by the dot and other agencies  our business also is subject to the effects of new tractor engine design requirements implemented by the epa such as those that became effective october   and are expected to become effective in which are discussed above under factors that may affect future results increased prices for  or increased costs of operating  new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment may materially and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
additional changes in the laws and regulations governing or impacting our industry could affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for  and the costs of providing  services to shippers 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials  underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of stormwater 
we operate in industrial areas  where truck terminals and other industrial facilities are located  and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage  and hazardous waste disposal  among others 
two of our terminal facilities are located adjacent to environmental superfund sites 
although we have not been named as a potentially responsible party in either case  we are potentially exposed to claims that we may have contributed to environmental contamination in the areas in which we operate 
we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances  or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 
difficulty in driver and independent contractor retention may have a materially adverse affect on our business 
difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors could have a materially adverse effect on our growth and profitability 
our independent contractors are responsible for paying for their own equipment  fuel  and other operating costs  and significant increases in these costs could cause them to seek higher compensation from us or seek other opportunities within or outside the trucking industry 
in addition  competition for drivers  which is always intense  increased during the second half of if a shortage of drivers should occur  or if we were unable to continue to attract and contract with independent contractors  we could experience an increase in the number of our tractors without drivers  which would lower our profitability  or be required to adjust our driver compensation package  which could adversely affect our profitability if not offset by a corresponding increase in rates 
we are highly dependent on a few major customers  the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of major customers 
for the year ended december   our top customers  based on revenue  accounted for approximately of our revenue  our top customers  approximately of our revenue  and our top customers  approximately of our revenue 
generally  we do not have long term contractual relationships with our major customers  and we cannot assure you that our customer relationships will continue as presently in effect 
a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
terion trailer tracking technology may not be available to us  which could require us to incur the cost of replacement technology  and adversely affect our trailer utilization and our ability to assess detention charges 
we utilize terion s trailer tracking technology to assist with monitoring the majority of our trailers 
terion has emerged from a chapter bankruptcy and a plan of reorganization has been approved by the bankruptcy court 
if terion ceases operations or abandons that trailer tracking technology  we would be required to incur the cost of replacing that technology or could be forced to operate without this technology  which could adversely affect our trailer utilization and our ability to assess detention charges 
our investment in concentrek may not be successful and we may be forced to write off part or all of our investment 
in april  we invested approximately  to acquire a minority interest in concentrek  inc concentrek  a transportation logistics company  the remainder of which is owned by members of the knight family and concentrek s management 
we also have loaned funds to concentrek on a secured basis to fund a portion of its start up costs 
at december   the outstanding amount of these loans was approximately million 
if concentrek s financial position does not continue to improve  and if it is unable to raise additional capital  we could be forced to write down all or part of our investment 
we may not be successful in our acquisition strategy  which could limit our growth prospects 
we may grow by acquiring other trucking companies or trucking assets 
acquisitions could involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities and or our incurring additional debt 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the acquired company s operations  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  the risks of entering into markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience  and the potential loss of customers  key employees and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we were to make acquisitions in the future  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired companies or assets into our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rate on debt and from changes in commodity prices 
under financial accounting reporting release number and securities and exchange commission rules and regulations  we are required to disclose information concerning market risk with respect to foreign exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we have elected to make such disclosures  to the extent applicable  using a sensitivity analysis approach  based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
except as described below  we have not had occasion to use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and do not use them for either speculation or tracking 
because our operations are confined to the united states  we are not subject to foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent the company borrows against its line of credit or incurs debt in the acquisition of revenue equipment 
we attempt to manage our interest rate risk by managing the amount of debt we carry 
in the opinion of management  an increase in short term interest rates could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition if our debt levels increase and if the interest rate increases are not offset by freight rate increases or other items 
management does not foresee or expect in the near future any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how that exposure is managed by us 
we have not issued corporate debt instruments 
commodity price risk we are also subject to commodity price risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside our control 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of our short term fuel price increases from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always fully offset an increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
for the fiscal year ended december   fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  represented of our total operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  compared to for the same period ending in we are party to three fuel hedging contracts relating to the price of heating oil on the new york mercantile exchange nymx that we entered into between october and february in connection with volume diesel fuel purchases 
if the price of heating oil on the nymx falls below per gallon we may be required to pay the difference between and the index price for million gallons per month for any selected twelve months through march   and for  gallons per month for the twelve months of at february   the price of heating oil on the nymx was for march contracts 
for each per gallon the price of heating oil would fall below per gallon during the relevant periods  our potential loss on the hedging contracts would be approximately million 
however  our net savings on fuel costs resulting from lower fuel prices under our volume diesel fuel purchase contracts would be approximately million  after taking the loss on the hedging contracts into consideration 
we have valued these items at fair value in the accompanying december   consolidated financial statements
