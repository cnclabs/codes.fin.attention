overview nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we are a leading limited service lodging company providing clean and comfortable rooms at affordable prices in convenient locations 
we are one of the largest owner operators of limited service hotels in the united states 
we earn revenue primarily by owning and operating la quinta inns including la quinta inns that are located on land that we lease from third parties and la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites containing approximately  rooms in states as of december nbsp  we strive to design hotels that attract both business and leisure travelers seeking quality rooms that are generally comparable to those of mid price  full service hotels  but at lower average room rates 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in addition to owning and operating our hotel properties  we also earn revenue by licensing the use of our proprietary brand names  including la quinta  la quinta inns and la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites in return for royalty and other fees through franchise agreements with franchisees 
as of december nbsp   our franchisees operated la quinta inns and la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites representing over  rooms under our brand 
other than our two consolidated joint ventures  we do not currently operate or manage any hotels under management agreements with third parties where we maintain an equity ownership position  have the ability to exercise significant influence or are exposed to risks of operations sufficient to require consolidation 
we also earn interest income on approximately  of healthcare related investments held at december nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  over the last four years  we have undergone significant financial and strategic changes 
in january nbsp  we began a strategy of selling non lodging real estate assets in order to focus on our lodging business 
as a result of that change in strategy  we replaced substantially all of our senior management with executives who have  on average  approximately nbsp  years of experience in lodging and lodging related industries 
we have improved the operations of our lodging assets  including the improvement of revenue performance  reduction of costs and introduction of a franchising program 
during that period  we also have sold approximately nbsp  billion of our non lodging assets  with proceeds from those sales applied to reduce indebtedness and strengthen our balance sheet 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as part of our continued focus on the improvement of revenue performance  we launched our redesigned la quinta returns loyalty program in we also invested significant capital in our hotels to enhance their competitive position and improve guest satisfaction 
in addition  we have added several new electronic distribution channels and have expanded and reshaped our sales force to put more emphasis on local sales efforts 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in december nbsp  our shareholders approved certain proposals that permitted us to reorganize the existing organization of our companies by merging a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of lq corporation  with and into lq properties  with lq properties surviving the reorganization and becoming a subsidiary controlled by lq corporation while continuing its status as a reit 
the new structure went into effect in january nbsp  we believe the reorganization  which was proposed primarily to address the challenges imposed by federal tax legislation on our previous grandfathered paired share reit structure  will enable us to grow our lodging real estate portfolio  management operations and brand franchising program without the restrictions imposed by this federal tax legislation 
key indicators of financial condition and operating performance nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we use a variety of financial and other information in monitoring the financial condition and operating performance of our business 
some of this information is financial information that is prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  while other information may be financial in nature and may not be prepared in accordance with gaap 
our management also uses other information that may not be financial in nature  including statistical information and comparative data 
our management uses this information to measure the performance of individual hotel properties  groups of hotel properties within a geographic region and or our business as a whole 
historical information is periodically compared against our internal budgets as well as against industry wide information 
we use this information for planning and monitoring our business  as well as in determining employee compensation 
operating statistics nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  guest satisfaction 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  guest satisfaction scores are a important indicator of how our products and services are being received and viewed by our customers 
we have focused our efforts over the past several years at increasing guest satisfaction scores as we believe guest satisfaction is a driver of repeat and referral business that leads to increased revenue 
guest satisfaction scores are monitored through a number of initiatives including surveys conducted by an independent market research company 
we believe that high levels of guest satisfaction are important to maintaining and growing our brand s reputation and recognition 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  adr  occupancy percentage and revpar 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  room revenue comprises approximately of our revenues and is dictated by demand  as measured by occupancy percentage  pricing  as measured by adr  and our available supply of hotel rooms 
revpar  which is another important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual property level and across our business as a whole and is the result of the combined impact of adr and occupancy 
revpar performance is evaluated on an absolute basis with comparison to budgeted and prior period performance  as well as on a company wide and regional basis 
additionally  revpar performance is compared and tracked against industry data for our defined competitive set within each local market as aggregated by smith travel research 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we believe our adr  occupancy percentage and revpar performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as regional and local employment growth  personal income and corporate earnings  office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions  airport and other business and leisure travel levels and new hotel construction by our competitors  as well as the pricing strategies of our full service lodging competitors 
our adr  occupancy percentage and or revpar performance is also impacted by factors specific to la quinta including our guest satisfaction scores  our choice of locations for our hotels  the expenditures that we incur to maintain and improve our hotel properties and the quality of the benefits that we offer our guests  such as our frequent traveler programs 
our available room supply is impacted by our access to capital and the expenditures that we incur to develop or acquire new hotels as well as the sale of existing hotels by us 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  inn operating contribution 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  ioc is a non gaap measure of an individual hotel property s level of profitability before fixed costs 
ioc focuses on revenues and expenses that management considers are controllable components of the hotel property level operations 
as part of ioc  we track and manage our costs per rented room as a measure of the variable costs to sell a room night 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  franchise monitoring 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we also monitor and track the number of franchise units opened and the overall growth in franchise revenues to measure the performance of our brand  as well as our franchise program  which we believe is important to increasing our presence in key geographic markets  as well as in entering additional geographic markets 
in addition  our management uses adr  occupancy percentage  revpar and guest satisfaction scores to monitor franchisee operating performance 
adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we use a variety of measures at the corporate level in order to monitor the performance of our business as a whole 
some of these measures are prepared in accordance with gaap  while others  such as adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or adjusted ebitda  are non gaap measures 
we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of performance because we believe it gives us a more complete understanding of our financial condition and operating results 
we use this metric to calculate various financial ratios and to measure our performance  and we believe some debt and equity investors also utilize this metric for similar purposes 
adjusted ebitda includes adjustments for non cash income or expenses such as depreciation  amortization and other non cash items 
adjusted ebitda is also adjusted for discontinued operations  income taxes  interest expense and minority interest which includes our preferred stock dividends of lq properties  as well as certain cash income or expense that we believe otherwise distort the comparability of the measure 
adjusted ebitda is intended to show unleveraged  pre tax operating results 
this is one of the measures we use to set management and executive incentive compensation 
adjusted ebitda is not intended to represent any measure of performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and our calculation and use of this measure may differ from our competitors 
this non gaap measure should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with gaap

decreases in lodging revenue of  or in compared to and  or in compared to were primarily the result of decreases in room revenues 
lodging revenues include revenues from room rentals and other revenue  such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service  fax machine use  movie and vending commissions  meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services 
room revenue  which accounted for  and in  and  respectively  of lodging revenues  is dictated by demand  measured as occupancy percentage  pricing  measured as adr  and the level of available room inventory 
operating statistics such as occupancy percentage  adr and revpar  which is the product of adr and occupancy percentage  are calculated based on all company owned hotels including properties held for sale and discontinued operations 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the decrease in room revenue of  or in compared to was due to several factors  including but not limited to  a weak operating environment in our top ten markets as outlined in the table above   declines in the percentage of full rate customers and the introduction of lower rates through certain electronic distribution channels 
as a result  our adr decreased  or  to for the year ended december nbsp  compared to for the year ended december nbsp    the sale of hotel properties excluding properties classified as discontinued operations during and caused decreases in room revenues for the year ended december nbsp  compared to the year ended december nbsp  the revenue related to properties sold during as well as the nbsp  months subsequent to the date of sale for those properties sold during these properties contributed to revenue for a full year versus a partial year in was approximately  and  a decline in occupancy experienced during the first half of primarily as a result of the continued sluggish economy and the uncertainty surrounding the threat of war in iraq 
the decrease in occupancy during the first half of was offset by an increase in occupancy experienced in the second half of due to higher demand from leisure travelers  increased volume from various internet travel sites  growth in membership of our la quinta returns program and advertising and promotion incentives 
revenues from third party distribution partners and our www

business and leisure travel continued to lag during as companies reduced corporate travel and the demand from leisure travelers remained weak 
this reduced demand was reflected in the decrease in our occupancy percentage to for the year ended december nbsp  compared to for the year ended december nbsp    declines in the percentage of full rate customers and reductions in rates in response to decreased demand 
as a result  our adr decreased  or  to for the year ended december nbsp  compared to for the year ended december nbsp   and  the sale of hotel properties during caused decreases in room revenues for the year ended december nbsp  compared to the year ended december nbsp  the revenue related to properties sold during as well as the nbsp  months subsequent to the date of sale for those sold during these properties contributed to revenue for a full year versus a partial year in  due to such sales was approximately  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  revpar increased  or in compared to and decreased  or  in compared to the revpar increase in and decrease in is the result of the above mentioned factors 
we expect stronger demand comparisons to continue into the first half of and level off during the second half of the year 
we expect demand from leisure travelers  increased volume from various internet travel sites  growth in membership of our la quinta returns program and advertising and promotion incentives to fuel and sustain improvements in revpar 
however  approximately two thirds of our business is booked within zero to seven days of the stay  therefore  forecasting such a trend is difficult 
declines in business and leisure traveler demand could impact our results 
we can give no assurance the trends experienced in the second half of will continue into nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the decreases in room revenue were partially offset by an increase in franchise fees charged to franchisees for operating under the la quinta trademark and using our hotel designs  operating systems and procedures

critical accounting policies and estimates nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our consolidated financial statements of lq corporation and separate financial statements of lq properties have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which require our management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures and contingencies 
our management evaluates estimates used in preparation of its financial statements on a continual basis  including estimates related to the following carrying amount and classification of lodging real estate assets  potential impairment and recognition of sales nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we evaluate the carrying value and classification of all owned lodging assets on an ongoing basis 
the evaluation process includes a review of current facts and circumstances such as guest satisfaction scores  profitability  changing market conditions  and condition of the property 
as a result of this evaluation process  we identify properties we intend to sell and properties we intend to hold for use 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  with respect to properties we intend to sell  our management begins to initiate marketing efforts upon obtaining authority to sell the property 
the properties that we expect to sell within twelve months are reclassified as assets held for sale and depreciation of the asset ceases upon this reclassification 
we record impairment charges on these properties when the estimated fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount of the property 
these assets are then monitored through the date of sale for potential adjustment based on the offers that we are willing to take under serious consideration and our continued review of facts and circumstances 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  for the assets that may take longer than one year to sell or for those assets we intend to hold and use  we estimate when the assets may be sold or otherwise disposed of 
we apply a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to recovery of the carrying amount of each lodging asset held for use to determine if the undiscounted net cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the property 
if this test results in a loss  we then calculate an impairment loss on the lodging asset held for use by determining the excess of the property s carrying amount over our estimate of fair market value of the asset 
the fair value of those assets becomes the new cost basis and is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as we sell the related assets  contracts are reviewed to determine if  a sale has been consummated   the buyer s investment is adequate   a complete transfer of risks and rewards has occurred  and  any contingencies or obligations on our part continue to exist

this change in the useful life did not have a material impact on the results of our operations 
during the years ended december nbsp  and  we recorded amortization expense of approximately  per year on the brand intangible assets 
these intangibles are tested annually for impairment or more frequently  if the occurrence of an event or circumstance warrants it

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  lq corporation s income tax expense or benefit is based on current taxable earnings before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the temporary differences between assets recognized for financial reporting and such amounts recognized for tax purposes  which require recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse

as of december nbsp   lq properties has not utilized nol carryforwards to offset amounts otherwise distributable to its shareholders 
also  lq properties may be liable for federal alternative minimum tax amt  for years in which it utilizes its regular tax loss carryovers 
any such amounts paid will be reflected as a current expense for the year paid 
this expense will be offset by a net deferred tax asset to the extent lq properties believes the amt will be utilized as a credit against lq properties regular tax liability  if any  in subsequent years 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   lq corporation exclusive of lq properties and its taxable reit subsidiaries had nol carryforwards of approximately  accordingly  although it will report federal income tax expense going forward  until the nol carryforwards are fully utilized  cash taxes paid will be limited to state franchise taxes based on net worth and state income taxes for those jurisdictions that do not follow the federal rules for utilization of nol carryforwards and amt 
any amt paid will be available as a credit in subsequent years to offset the excess of lq corporation s regular tax liability over its amt liability calculated for those years

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we perform formal reviews of estimates of the ultimate liability for losses and associated expenses within the deductible and retention limits on a bi annual basis 
the estimates are based upon a third party actuarial analysis of actual historical development trends of loss frequency  severity and incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
the actuary utilizes a loss triangle method to measure period to period loss trends 
loss development factors and increased limits factors are calculated based on historical experience and are used to estimate the ultimate loss liability 
we establish a collective overall accrual to cover our estimated ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported claims and ibnr claims and associated insurance plan expenses 
large claims or incidents that could potentially involve material amounts are also monitored closely on a case by case basis

changes in estimates occur over time due to factors such as severity of injury that affect liability claims differently from those predicted in prior liability estimates 
the establishment of these liabilities is an inherently uncertain process  which is characteristic of liability claims or other long term liabilities  which can be influenced by external factors and assumptions 
the ultimate cost of losses from la quinta s insurance programs may vary from recorded amounts  which are based on la quinta s best estimates of future losses or obligations 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  at december nbsp  and  the impact of an increase or decrease of one percent in net reserves in la quinta s estimated exposure to losses from gl claims  al claims  and wc claims would increase or decrease its loss before income tax by  and  respectively

in january nbsp  we changed the healthcare benefit coverage provided to our field level hourly employees so that coverage for these employees is no longer part of this self insurance program but covered under a separate fully insured health program 
payments for major medical and hospitalization to individual participants below specified amounts currently   per individual per year and  per individual for a lifetime maximum are self insured by us 
we base our estimate of ultimate liability on trends in claim payment history  historical trends in ibnr incidents and developments in other cost components such as rising medical costs  projected premium costs  number of participants  etc our liability with respect to employee healthcare reserves is monitored on a monthly basis and adjusted accordingly

the expense related to this estimate includes the cost of administering the program as well as the incremental cost of the stay at an owned hotel and the value of awards purchased from program partners 
la quinta determines the value of the future redemption obligation based upon historical experience  including an estimate of breakage for points that will never be redeemed 
the estimate is based on a calculation that includes an assumption for redemption rate  redemption type whether for free stay certificate or other award and rate of redemption at company owned hotels versus franchised hotels 
the expenses of the program are charged to operations as a component of other lodging and general and administrative expenses 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  actual results of the program may vary from estimates we have made due primarily to variance from assumptions used in the calculation of our obligation for future redemptions and changes in member behavior

certain gains and losses on long lived assets classified as held for sale that were disposed of during the years ended december nbsp   and have been classified in continuing operations because they were classified as held for sale as of december nbsp  and restatement of prior periods is not permitted under sfas nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  goodwill historically represented the excess of cost over the fair value of assets associated with the acquisition of la quinta and telematrix  nbsp  inc and had been amortized on a straight line basis over and nbsp  years  respectively 
to determine if goodwill had been impaired  the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges was compared to the carrying amount of the long lived assets including allocated goodwill in order to assess whether an impairment loss existed 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in january nbsp  we implemented sfas nbsp  which primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
sfas nbsp  nbsp  prohibits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  nbsp  requires testing of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis for impairment and more frequently if the occurrence of an event or circumstance indicates an impairment  nbsp  requires that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill and nbsp  removes the nbsp  year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we completed the two step process prescribed by sfas nbsp  for nbsp  testing for impairment and nbsp  determining the amount of impairment loss related to goodwill associated with our two reporting units la quinta lodging  carrying value and telematrix  nbsp  inc telecommunications  carrying value 
as a result  we recorded a charge to earnings of  to reflect the adjustment to goodwill for the lodging reporting unit that is reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in addition  we recorded a charge to earnings of approximately  related to goodwill for the telematrix reporting unit as of the date we implemented sfas nbsp  which has been subsequently reclassified to discontinued operations 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a charge of  to write off the remaining balance for telematrix  which is also included in discontinued operations 
for tax purposes goodwill is a permanent difference  therefore  the charge to earnings had no tax impact 
as a result of the cumulative effect of implementation  we incurred a decrease in amortization of goodwill and a corresponding annual reduction in net loss of  for the years ended december nbsp  and as compared to recent accounting standards nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in november nbsp  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
nbsp  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that  upon issuance of a guarantee  a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair market value of an obligation assumed under the guarantee 
disclosures by the guarantor in its interim and quarterly financial statements about obligations associated with guarantees issued are also required by fin the recognition requirements of fin are effective for guarantees that are issued after december nbsp  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  and is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may nbsp   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june nbsp  as a result of further discussion by the fasb on october nbsp   the fasb clarified that minority interests in consolidated partnerships with specified finite lives should be reclassified as liabilities and presented at fair market value unless the interests are convertible into the equity of the parent 
fair market value adjustments occurring subsequent to july nbsp  would be recorded as a component of interest expense 
at their october nbsp  meeting  the fasb agreed to indefinitely defer the implementation of a portion of sfas nbsp  regarding the accounting treatment for minority interests in finite life partnerships 
therefore  until a final resolution is reached  we will not implement this aspect of the standard 
if we were to adopt this aspect of the standard under its current provisions  we would reclassify approximately  of minority interest to a liability and recognize a gain of approximately  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of taxes

variable interest entities vies are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if they do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
under fin  the primary beneficiary of a vie is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests

these various forms of financing or incentive payments will be evaluated by us to determine the appropriate accounting treatment under the requirements of fin nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  on february nbsp   we adopted fin for vies created after january nbsp  and for vies in which we obtained an interest after january nbsp  and in both cases  it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
