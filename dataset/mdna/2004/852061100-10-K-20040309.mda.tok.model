overview business sprint is a global communications company and a leader in integrating long distance  local service  and wireless communications 
sprint is also one of the largest carriers of internet traffic using its tier one internet protocol network  which provides connectivity to any point on the internet either through its own network or via direct connections with other backbone providers 
sprint is the nation s third largest provider of long distance services  based on revenues  and operates nationwide  all digital long distance and tier one internet protocol networks 
sprint currently serves approximately million access lines in its franchise territories in states 
additionally  sprint provides local service using its facilities  leased facilities or unbundled network elements provided by other carriers in a total of states and the district of columbia 
sprint is selling into the cable telephony market through arrangements with cable companies that resell sprint long distance service and use sprint back office systems and network assets in support of their local telephone service provided over cable facilities 
sprint also operates a digital pcs wireless network with licenses to provide service to the entire united states population  including puerto rico and the us virgin islands  using a single frequency band and a single technology 
the pcs group  together with third party affiliates  operates pcs systems in over metropolitan markets  including the largest us metropolitan areas 
the pcs group s service  including third party affiliates  reaches a quarter billion people 
the pcs group  combined with our wholesale and affiliate partners  served more than million customers at the end of industry environment sprint operates in industries that have been and continue to be subject to consolidation and dynamic change 
therefore  sprint routinely reassesses its business strategies 
due to changes in the telecommunications industry  including bankruptcies  over capacity and the current economic environment  sprint continually assesses the implications on its operations 
any such assessment may impact the valuation of its long lived assets 
as part of its overall business strategy  sprint regularly evaluates opportunities to expand and complement its business and may at any time be discussing or negotiating a transaction that  if consummated  could have a material effect on its business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
in  sprint sold its directory publishing business to rh donnelley for billion in cash 
business transformation currently  sprint s operations are divided into three segments the global markets division  the local division  and the pcs wireless telephony products and services business 
in an effort to enhance the focus on the needs and preferences of two distinct customer types businesses and consumers  sprint s market facing business units have been aligned into the sprint business solutions sbs unit  sprint consumer solutions scs unit and the sprint local consumer solutions slcs unit 
this effort is expected to enable sprint to more effectively and efficiently use its portfolio of assets to create customer focused communications solutions 
during  sprint intends to continue to measure its activities using its current business segments  and begin to measure certain activities under this customer focused approach 
throughout  management anticipates continuing to make decisions using the current segmentation 
however  part of the decision making process will include viewing opportunities from a customer centric perspective 
sprint intends to develop and deliver integrated products and services which will help our customers function more effectively in the workplace and in daily life 
in conjunction with these market facing business unit realignments  sprint is undertaking initiatives to improve productivity through consolidating systems and eliminating redundancies application rationalization automation process re engineering e enablement organizational redesign and streamlining these efforts have resulted in restructuring charges and asset impairments in the fourth quarter of and will continue to impact subsequent quarters 
ongoing efforts in these areas may have additional impacts in subsequent periods 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information relating to these activities 
tracking stock structure in november  sprint s shareholders approved the allocation of all of sprint s assets and liabilities into two groups  the fon group and the pcs group  as well as the creation of the fon stock and the pcs stock 
fon common stock and pcs common stock are intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the fon and pcs groups 
however  they are classes of common stock of sprint  not of the group they are intended to track 
the fon group is comprised of the global markets division  the local division and other businesses consisting primarily of wholesale distribution of telecommunications products 
the global markets division is the nation s third largest provider of long distance services based on revenues 
the activities of the local division include local exchange communications and consumer long distance services used by customers within sprint s local franchise territories 
the fon group also includes its investments in earthlink  inc earthlink  an internet service provider  and call net enterprises  inc call net  a long distance provider in canada 
the pcs group includes sprint s wireless pcs operations 
the pcs group also includes its investment in virgin mobile  usa  a joint venture to market wireless services  principally to youth and pre pay segments 
considerations relating to tracking stocks on february   sprint s board of directors decided to recombine the tracking stocks and return to a single common stock 
as a result  each share of the pcs common stock will convert automatically into shares of fon common stock on april  the fon stock will represent the only outstanding common stock of sprint 
after the recombination  sprint will continue to present consolidated financial information  but will not include group level information 
the recombination will not impact sprint s current presentation of all required segment information 
until the recombination  the fon common stock and the pcs common stock are intended to track the performance of the fon group and the pcs group  respectively 
because the fon common stock and the pcs common stock are classes of common stock of sprint  not common stock of the group they are intended to track  the holders of the fon common stock and the pcs common stock are subject to the risks related to an equity investment in sprint and all of sprint s businesses  assets and liabilities 
therefore  the market prices of the fon common stock and the pcs common stock may not accurately reflect the performance of the group they are intended to track 
between the announcement and the completion of the recombination  the price of the tracking stocks may reflect the expectation that a single common stock will result from the recombination  rather than reflecting the performance of the groups 
sprint has a single board of directors 
consequently  there is no board of directors that owes separate duties to the holders of either the fon common stock or the pcs common stock 
conflicts of interest between holders of fon common stock and pcs common stock in transactions between the fon group and the pcs group or in our dealings with third parties could be resolved by our board of directors to the detriment of the holders of one or the other class of common stock 
after the recombination of the tracking stocks  events that would have benefited the holders of only one of the tracking stocks will benefit all sprint shareholders 
consolidated results of operations total net operating revenues were as follows millions fon group pcs group intergroup eliminations net operating revenues income loss from continuing operations was as follows millions fon group pcs group income loss from continuing operations income loss from continuing operations as presented in the above table includes the after tax impacts of the items discussed in the following paragraphs 
in  sprint recorded net restructuring charges and asset impairments of billion 
these charges were associated with the write down to fair value of the fon group s multipoint multichannel distribution services mmds spectrum  other asset impairment charges  facilities and severance charges associated with the termination of the web hosting business  impairment charges associated with the termination of development of a new billing platform  impairment charges associated with the termination of software development projects  and severance costs associated with sprint s transformation to a customer focused organizational design  offset by the finalization of all and restructuring liabilities

critical accounting policies the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend the business activities of sprint 
to aid in that understanding  management has identified sprint s critical accounting policies 
these policies are considered critical because they have the potential to have a material impact on sprint s financial statements  and because they require judgements and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 
long lived asset recovery a significant portion of sprint s total assets consist of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment pp e and definite life intangibles  as well as goodwill and indefinite life intangibles 
changes in technology or in sprint s intended use of these assets  as well as changes in broad economic or industry factors  may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
depreciable lives of assets sprint performs annual internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for each category of pp e 
these studies utilize models  which take into account actual usage  physical wear and tear  replacement history  and assumptions about technology evolution  and use in certain instances actuarially determined probabilities to calculate remaining life of our asset base 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to the establishment of asset depreciable lives is a critical accounting estimate because it requires sprint management to make assumptions about technology evolution and competitive uses of assets  and the impact of changes in these assumptions could be material to our financial position  as well as our results of operations 
management s assumptions about technology and its future development require significant judgement because the timing and impacts of technology advances are difficult to predict  and actual experience has varied from previous assumptions and could continue to do so 
if sprint s studies had resulted in a depreciable rate that was higher or lower than those used in the preparation of sprint s consolidated financial statements  recorded depreciation expense would have been impacted by approximately million 
the impact to fon group depreciation expense would have been approximately million and the impact to pcs group depreciation expense would have been approximately million 
property  plant and equipment and definite life intangibles impairment pp e and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that if an impairment indicator is present  sprint must assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is unrecoverable by estimating the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from the asset  undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount  an impairment charge must be recognized  based on the fair value of the asset 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it requires sprint management to make assumptions about future revenues and costs of sales over the life of the asset  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on our financial position  as well as our results of operations  could be material 
management s assumptions about future revenues require significant judgement because actual revenues have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so 
in estimating future revenues  we use our internal business forecasts 
we develop our forecasts based on recent revenue data for existing products and services  planned timing of new products and services  and other industry and economic factors 
when indicators are present  sprint tests for impairment 
this resulted in total pp e impairments of million  million and  million in  and  respectively 
in  fon group recorded million associated with the termination of its web hosting business and software development projects 
pcs group recorded million associated with the terminated development of a new billing platform and a software development project 
these impairments represent percent of the december  consolidated net pp e 
in  fon group recorded million for network asset impairments and pcs group recorded million for abandoned network projects 
these impairments represent less than percent of the december  consolidated net pp e 
in  fon group recorded  million with the termination of efforts to provide its sprint ion consumer and business offerings 
this impairment represents percent of the december  consolidated net pp e 
goodwill and indefinite life intangibles goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are reviewed at least annually for impairment  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill is tested by comparing net book value of the reporting unit identified as sprint s operating segments to fair value 
indefinite life intangibles are tested by comparing book value to estimated fair value 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to goodwill and indefinite life intangibles is a critical accounting estimate because it requires sprint management to make assumptions about fair values  and the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material to our financial position  as well as our results of operations 
management s assumptions about fair values require significant judgement because broad economic factors  industry factors and technology considerations can result in variable and volatile fair values 
management completed impairment analyses on both goodwill and indefinite life intangibles in the fourth quarter 
these tests were performed internally 
as of december   no goodwill impairment existed 
similarly  wireless spectrum and trademark value were not impaired 
however  in the third quarter  the fon group s global markets division decided to end pursuit of a residential fixed wireless strategy using its mmds spectrum 
this decision required an impairment analysis of the asset 
sprint fon group recorded a pre tax  non cash charge of billion related to the write down in the fair value of its mmds spectrum 
sprint is now focusing its efforts on a broad range of alternative strategies 
sprint is continuing to invest in the spectrum  is monitoring technology and industry developments  and is involved in efforts to achieve favorable regulatory rulings with respect to this spectrum 
employee benefit plan assumptions retirement benefits are a significant cost of doing business for sprint and yet represent obligations that will be settled far in the future 
retirement benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of the future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by sprint 
the accounting requires that management make assumptions regarding such variables as the return on assets  the discount rate and future health care costs 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligation and periodic benefit cost incurred by sprint 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to retirement benefit accounting is a critical accounting estimate because it requires sprint management to make assumptions about discount rates  future health care costs  and future return on assets funding the obligation  and the impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates would have on the projected benefit obligation reported on our balance sheet and the benefit cost could be material 
in determining pension obligations assumptions are required concerning market performance 
market performance has fluctuated in the recent past and could have continued volatility in the future 
in selecting its assumptions  sprint uses historical experience  as well as objective indices  as benchmarks  and tests the benchmarks against historical industry data on these assumptions provided by an independent actuary 
an increase in the discount rate would reduce the reported projected benefit obligation 
in contrast  if the discount rate in used in determining the projected benefit obligation was basis points lower  it would generate a million increase in the projected benefit obligation reported on the balance sheet  and an million increase in the benefit costs 
similarly  if the expected return on assets assumption was basis points lower  it would generate an million increase in current year benefit costs 
this assumption is not used in calculation of the pension projected benefit obligation 
in determining post retirement medical and life insurance benefit obligations  assumptions are made concerning the cost of health care 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed medical inflation rate would generate a million increase in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation reported on the balance sheet  and a million increase in benefit expense 
an increase in the discount rate would reduce the reported accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
in contrast  if the discount rate in used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was basis points lower  it would generate a million increase in the reported year end obligation and a million increase in benefit expense 
allocation policies between tracking stocks as discussed previously  the fon common stock is intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the fon group and the pcs common stock is intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the pcs group 
the fon common stock and the pcs common stock are both classes of the common stock of sprint  and together  the groups reflect of sprint s business activities 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to allocation policies is a critical accounting estimate because it requires sprint management to make assumptions about market interest rates and group use of shared costs  and the impact that recognizing a change in this allocation would have on the net assets  use of resources or operating results of either group could be material 
allocation policies regarding shared activities impact the business results of the fon group and the pcs group 
sprint performs internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of assignment of costs when direct assignment is not possible or practical 
the methods used for indirect assignment include time studies  and factors related to marketing or headcount studies 
sprint manages the financing activities of the groups on a centralized basis 
debt incurred by sprint on behalf of the groups is specifically allocated to and reflected in the financial statements of the applicable group 
interest expense is assigned to the pcs group based on an estimated rate that is substantially equal to the rate it would be able to obtain from third parties as a direct or indirect wholly owned sprint subsidiary  but without the benefit of any guarantee by sprint or any member of the fon group 
additionally  sprint s centralized cash management program allows one group to advance funds to the other group 
these advances are accounted for as short term borrowings between the groups and bear interest at a rate that is substantially equal to the rate that group would be able to obtain from third parties on a short term basis 
management utilizes credit rating agencies and investment banks to provide an objective basis for determining appropriate assumptions concerning market interest rates 
sprint uses this information in arriving at the assumptions used to determine our allocations 
the allocation of assets  financial resources and certain expenses require judgement by management and the allocation methods used are subject to the discretion of the board of directors in its fulfillment of its fiduciary duties to all of sprint s shareholders 
holders of fon stock and pcs stock may have interests that differ from or conflict with the interests of holders of the other stock 
our tracking stock policies provide that our board of directors  in resolving material matters in which holders of fon stock and pcs stock have potentially divergent interests  will act in the best interest of sprint and all of its common stockholders after giving fair consideration to the potentially divergent interests of the holders of the separate classes of common stock 
tax valuation allowances sprint is required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in its financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process requires sprint s management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact 
sprint records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizable future tax benefits 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law  significant changes in the jurisdictions in which sprint operates  sprint s inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year s liability by taxing authorities 
these changes can have a significant impact on the financial position of sprint 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to establishing tax valuation allowances is a critical accounting estimate because it requires sprint management to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities  and the impact changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefit as reported in our results of operations could be material 
management s assumptions require significant judgement because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so 
sprint currently carries an income tax valuation allowance of million on its books 
this amount includes a valuation allowance for the total tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards which were acquired in connection with certain acquisitions 
the remainder of the valuation allowance relates to state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
assumption changes which result in a reduction of expected benefits from realization of state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards by would increase our valuation allowance by million for pcs group and million for fon group 
revenue recognition policies sprint recognizes operating revenues as services are rendered or as products are delivered to customers in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
in connection with recording revenue  estimates and assumptions are required in determining the expected conversion of the revenue streams to cash collected 
the revenue estimation process requires management to make assumptions based on historical results  future expectations  the economic and competitive environment  changes in the credit worthiness of our customers  and other relevant factors 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the projection of cash collected and the periodic revenue stream recognized by sprint 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to the establishment of revenue and receivable reserves and the associated provisions in the results of operations is a critical accounting estimate because it requires sprint management to make assumptions about future billing adjustments for disputes with customers  unauthorized usage  future returns on asset sales and future access adjustments for disputes with competitive local exchange carriers and inter exchange carriers  as well as the future economic viability of our customer base  and the impact of changes in actual performance versus these estimates would have on the accounts receivable reported on our balance sheet and the results reported in our statements of operations could be material 
in selecting these assumptions  sprint uses historical trending of write offs  industry norms  regulatory decisions and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions which might impact the collectibility of accounts 
segmental results of operations sprint s business is divided into three segments the global markets division  the local division  and the pcs wireless telephony products and services business 
global markets division the global markets division provides a broad suite of communications services targeted to domestic business and residential customers  multinational corporations and other communications companies 
these services include domestic and international voice  data communications using various protocols such as internet protocol ip and frame relay a data service that transfers packets of data over sprint s network  and managed network services 
additionally  the global markets division provides local service using sprint s facilities  leased facilities or unbundled network elements provided by other carriers in a total of states and the district of columbia 
the global markets division is selling into the cable telephony market through arrangements with cable companies that resell sprint long distance service and use sprint back office systems and network assets in support of their local telephone service provided over cable facilities 
in addition  the global markets division provides consulting services and international data communications 
the global markets division also includes the operating results of the wireless high speed data and cable tv service operations of the broadband fixed wireless companies 
in  sprint announced it would halt further deployment of mmds using current line of sight technology 
in  sprint s ongoing evaluation of its business use for the mmds spectrum resulted in a decision to end pursuit of a residential fixed wireless strategy 
this decision required an impairment analysis of this asset  resulting in a pre tax  non cash charge of billion 
sprint is now focusing its efforts on a broad range of alternative strategies 
sprint is continuing to invest in the spectrum  is monitoring technology and industry developments  and is involved in efforts to achieve favorable regulatory rulings with respect to this spectrum 
in  sprint announced the wind down of its web hosting business 
millions net operating revenues voice data internet other total net operating revenues operating expenses costs of services and products selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization restructuring and asset impairments total operating expenses operating income loss capital expenditures the global markets division continued to face significant challenges in the decline in voice revenues and loss of revenues from a low margin wholesale customer contributed to an decline in net operating revenues 
this  along with the write down in the mmds spectrum  resulted in an operating loss for the year 
throughout  the global markets division focused on cost management 
in  the global markets division achieved a double digit reduction in costs of services and products  and a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in  sprint undertook initiatives to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs 
these actions  along with a pre tax  non cash charge of billion related to the write down to fair value of its mmds spectrum  resulted in a  million net charge to the global markets division s operations 
sprint expects revenues to decline in as the division continues to be impacted by intense competitive pressures 
these declines are expected to be somewhat offset by growing contributions from sales of strategic products 
in addition  sprint expects the transformation to a customer centric organization to allow us to offer competitive differentiation  in an effort to increase our customers loyalty 
net operating revenues net operating revenues decreased in and in loss of a major wholesale customer and a large prepaid customer drove a minute volume decline of in minute growth of in was driven in part by an increase in business minutes sold to the pcs group  which was partially offset by the highly competitive pricing pressures on voice services 
the decrease in net operating revenues also reflects the loss of revenues from this major wholesale customer 
voice revenues voice revenues decreased in both and the and decreases are the result of a decline in consumer voice revenue due to wireless and e mail substitution  aggressive competition from regional bell operating companies for consumer and small business customers and lower business voice pricing 
results in and were also impacted by the loss of a single major wholesale customer 
data revenues data revenues reflect sales of current generation data services including asynchronous transfer mode atm and frame relay services 
data revenues were flat in both and in  increases in frame relay were offset by a decline in both atm and private line 
in  increases in frame relay and atm were offset by a decline in private line 
internet revenues internet revenues decreased in and increased in the decrease is primarily the result of a decline in dial ip due to the final contractually scheduled repricing of the america online  inc  dial ip agreement  partially offset by revenues from a fourth quarter partial buyout of a portion of a dial ip contract 
the increase was due to growth in dedicated ip revenues partially offset by a decrease in dial ip due to repricing of contracts and growth in web hosting 
while sprint has made the decision to exit the web hosting business  the period still reflects the increased web hosting revenue in the first and second quarters 
other revenues other revenues decreased in and in the decreases are primarily due to the sale of our consulting services business  paranet  in the third quarter of and declines in miscellaneous equipment sales 
during the and periods  cable capacity sales and sales of ownership rights to transoceanic cable represented less than and of global market division s net operating revenues  respectively 
these transactions were executed primarily with global one  and were in accordance with our transition services agreement 
in  the global markets division did not have any cable capacity sales 
equipment sales completed in each of the periods discussed were routine in nature  were completed to support customer purchases of related telecommunications services  and represented less than   and of global market division s net operating revenues for the   and periods  respectively 
costs of services and products costs of services and products include interconnection costs paid to local phone companies  other domestic service providers and foreign phone companies to complete calls made by the division s domestic customers  costs to operate and maintain the long distance networks  and costs of equipment 
costs of services and products decreased in and in the decrease was due to volume declines  an improving product mix  initiatives to reduce access unit costs  favorable carrier access settlements and fcc mandated access rate reductions 
the decrease was a result of fcc mandated access rate reductions  decreased network operating costs derived from sprint s fourth quarter restructuring actions  and favorable carrier access settlements  as well as other cost containment efforts  partially offset by volume growth 
the fcc mandated access rate reductions took effect in july  july and july total costs of services and products for the global markets division were of net operating revenues in  in  and in selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased in and in the decline was due to reduced bad debt expense including the mci formerly worldcom accounts receivable settlement  restructuring efforts  and general cost controls partially offset by the costs of the executive separation agreements recorded in the second quarter of and the long term disability charge recorded in the fourth quarter of the decrease is related to restructuring efforts and tight management of discretionary expenses 
the reserve for bad debts requires management s judgment and is based on customer specific indicators  as well as historical trending  industry norms and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions 
bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues was in  in  and in these reductions reflect an improvement in collections  aging and recoveries of previously written off accounts 
reserve for bad debt as a percentage of outstanding accounts receivable was in  in  and in total sg a expense for the global markets division was of net operating revenues in  in  and in depreciation and amortization expense estimates and assumptions are used in setting depreciable lives 
assumptions are based on internal studies of use  industry data on lives  recognition of technological advancements and understanding of business strategy 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in and increased in the decrease was due to asset impairments associated with the wind down of the web hosting business and lower capital spending 
the increase is attributable to an increased asset base to meet anticipated increases in demand for voice and data related services and other growth initiatives 
this increase was partially offset by the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization expense was of net operating revenues in  in  and in restructuring and asset impairments in the fourth quarter  sprint recorded restructuring charges representing severance costs associated with sprint s transformation to a customer focused organization offset by the finalization of all and restructuring liabilities 
this resulted in an expense reduction of million allocated to the global markets division 
in the third quarter  the fon group recorded a pre tax  non cash charge of billion related to the write down in the fair value of its mmds spectrum 
sprint s ongoing evaluation of its business use for this asset resulted in a decision to end pursuit of a residential fixed wireless strategy 
this decision required an impairment analysis of the asset 
sprint is now focusing its efforts on a broad range of alternative strategies 
sprint is continuing to invest in the spectrum  is monitoring technology and industry developments  and is involved in efforts to achieve favorable regulatory rulings with respect to this spectrum 
in the second quarter  sprint announced the wind down of its web hosting business 
restructurings of other global markets division operations also occurred in the continuing effort to create a more efficient cost structure 
these decisions resulted in pre tax charges of million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
the charge for asset impairments was million  the charge for employee terminations was million and the remaining million was accrued for facility lease terminations 
sprint will record additional wind down related charges for facility lease terminations  customer migration  employee termination  and other wind down costs in subsequent periods 
sprint expects the aggregate pre tax charge associated with the wind down of the web hosting business to be approximately million 
in the fourth quarter  sprint recorded a net restructuring charge of million to the global markets division related to consolidations in sprint s network  information technology  and billing and accounts receivable organizations as well as additional steps to reduce overall operating costs 
additionally  it recorded a network asset impairment related to the global markets division of million 
sprint recorded a net restructuring charge and asset impairment of million related to the global markets division in the third quarter 
this consisted of a million charge for the termination of high speed data services  as well as additional steps to reduce operating costs 
the charge was partially offset by a million adjustment to finalize the restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter to abandon the ion initiative and restructure operations in the global markets division 
the fourth quarter actions  which resulted in a billion charge to the global markets division  were taken in an effort to better focus on enterprise data and internet services and to aggressively manage costs 
for additional information see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
local division the local division consists mainly of regulated local phone companies serving approximately million access lines in states 
the local division provides local voice and data services  including digital subscriber line dsl  for customers within its franchise territories  access by phone customers and other carriers to the local division s local network  nationwide long distance services to residential customers located within its franchise territories  sales of telecommunications equipment  and other services within specified calling areas to residential and business customers 
the local division provides wireless services to customers in its franchise territories through agency relationships 
dsl enables high speed transmission of data over existing copper telephone lines 
millions net operating revenues voice data other total net operating revenues operating expenses costs of services and products selling  general and administrative depreciation restructuring and asset impairments total operating expenses operating income loss operating margin capital expenditures in  the local division continued to be impacted by the economic environment  broadband competition for high speed data in the consumer market  competition and product substitution for business customers and wireless substitution resulting in a decline in access lines and minutes of use 
in  sprint recorded restructuring charges associated with sprint s transformation to a customer focused organization offset by the finalization of and restructuring liabilities 
these actions resulted in a million charge to the local division s operations 
additionally  a million asset impairment was recorded related to the termination of a partnership to provide video on demand to hotels 
the local division expects a small revenue decline in increases in revenue associated with bundled services and broadband sales is expected to be offset by a modest decline in access lines 
net operating revenues net operating revenues decreased in and less than in the slight decrease in both years was due to declines in long distance  fewer access lines and declines in equipment sales being partially offset by an increase in network based services and dsl services 
the local division ended with just over million switched access lines  a decrease of from the prior year 
access lines decreased in the decreases in and were driven by wireless and broadband substitution  losses to competitive local providers  and the economic environment 
the reduction in access lines is expected to continue although sprint expects its ongoing rate of line loss to be less than loss rates experienced by other major carriers 
voice revenues voice revenues  derived from local exchange services  long distance revenue and switched access revenue decreased in and in due to lower long distance minutes of use and the decrease in access lines  partially offset by the demand for network based services driven by the success of bundled offerings

costs of services and products were of net operating revenues in  in  and in selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense increased in in  sg a decreased despite increases in bad debt expense 
the increase is driven by the long term disability charge recorded in the fourth quarter  the executive separation agreements and higher pension costs somewhat offset by general cost controls and lower bad debt expense

the pcs group supplements its own network through affiliation arrangements with other companies that use cdma 
under these arrangements  these companies offer pcs services using sprint s spectrum under the sprint brand name on cdma networks built and operated at their own expense 
several of these affiliates are experiencing financial difficulties and are evaluating or have completed restructuring activities 
two affiliates have filed for bankruptcy protection and made claims against us in the bankruptcy courts 
one other affiliate has filed suit against us

reserves have been established that are expected to provide for the ultimate resolution of these disputes  and sprint is in negotiations with some of the affiliates regarding restructuring its relationship with them 
sprint has reached agreements with several of its affiliates  including two of the largest who have completed restructuring activities 
sprint has amended the existing agreements to provide for a simplified pricing mechanism  as well as refining and changing various business processes 
the amended agreements cover approximately of the customers served by all affiliates 
the agreements provide simplified and predictable long term pricing for service bureau fees and stability to the rates charged for inter area service fees 
in addition  sprint and the companies settled all significant outstanding disputes 
the revised terms under the agreements are expected to have an immaterial impact on future pcs group results 
the pcs group may incur additional expenses to ensure that service is available to its customers in the areas served by its affiliates 
if any of the pcs group affiliates cease operations  the pcs group may incur roaming charges in areas where service was previously provided by the affiliates and costs to meet fcc buildout and renewal requirements  as well as experience lower revenues 
the pcs group also provides wireless services to companies that resell wireless services to their customers on a retail basis under their own brand 
these companies bear the costs of acquisition  billing and customer service 
in the third quarter  sprint executed a five year wholesale agreement with qwest communications qwest whereby qwest wireless subscribers will use sprint s national pcs network and have access to sprint branded vision data services

sprint will serve as the exclusive provider to qwest of wireless services for resale in the markets served by the pcs group 
the transition of customers to the pcs network will begin in early the wireless industry  including the pcs group  typically generates a higher number of subscriber additions and handset sales in the fourth quarter of each year compared to the other quarters 
this is due to the use of retail distribution  which is dependent on the holiday shopping season  the timing of new products and service introductions  and aggressive marketing and sales promotions

equipment sales to one retail chain and the subsequent service revenues generated by sales to its customers accounted for of net operating revenues in  in and in net operating revenues customers at year end millions average monthly service revenue per user arpu average monthly service revenue per user arpu is calculated by dividing wireless service revenues by weighted average monthly wireless subscribers 
this is a measure which uses gaap as the basis for the calculation 
arpu  which is used by most wireless companies  is a method of valuing the recurring activity by measuring revenue on a per user basis 
analysts and investors primarily use arpu to compare relative value across the wireless industry 
net operating revenues include service revenues and sales of handsets and accessory equipment 
service revenues consist of monthly recurring charges  usage charges  a pro rata portion of activation fees and miscellaneous fees such as directory assistance  operator assisted calling  handset insurance and late payment charges 
in  sprint saw increased pricing pressures and lower overage charges from usage based plans  which were offset by customers subscribing to higher usage service plans  increased revenues from data services and increased fees 
average monthly usage in was hours compared to hours in at the end of the period more than one third of the customer base was using data services compared to approximately at the end of the pcs group had million post paid retail customer additions in to end the year with million customers 
resellers added million customers in  increasing their customer base to million from  in  principally due to virgin mobile  usa 
the pcs group third party affiliates added more than  customers in this brings the total number of customers served on the pcs network  including post paid retail  affiliate  and resale customers  to approximately million in more than metropolitan markets nationwide at the year end 
in  nearly percent of new post paid retail customers chose to include pcs vision in their service package 
service revenues increased in mainly reflecting an increase in the number of direct customers  increased revenue from wholesale and affiliate partners  and stable arpu

customer churn is calculated by dividing the customers who discontinued pcs service by the weighted average subscribers for the period 
this is an operational measure which is used by most wireless companies as a method of estimating the life of the customer 
analysts and investors primarily use churn to compare relative value across the wireless industry 
in  the customer churn rate decreased to from in this was a slight increase from in the improvement was primarily due to a reduction in the involuntary churn rate as the pcs group benefited from effective customer retention programs and credit management policies initiated in the fourth quarter 
this improvement was partially offset by a slight increase in voluntary churn due in part to the institution of wlnp in the fourth quarter of the increase resulted primarily from company initiated churn largely associated with the deactivation of clear pay customers  as well as a slight increase in the voluntary churn rate 
in november  wlnp was instituted for the largest markets across the united states 
while the pcs group experienced an increase in churn in december following wlnp implementation  the fourth quarter impact on net additions was immaterial 
we intend to implement wlnp beyond the largest markets in may the vast majority of pcs customers are resident in the largest markets where wlnp is already available 
revenues from sales of handsets and accessories  including new customers and upgrades  were approximately of net operating revenues in  in and in these declines were mainly due to higher rebates and lower gross additions 
as part of the pcs group s marketing plans  handsets  net of rebates  are usually sold at prices below cost 
other service revenues consist of net fees collected from affiliates for network operation and customer maintenance and also include revenues from the wholesale of pcs services to companies that resell to their customers on a retail basis 
other revenues represented of net operating revenues in  in and in the increase mainly reflects net additions to the affiliate base and the wholesale customer base through virgin mobile  usa 
the decrease is primarily due to discontinuation of a specific reseller program 
the pcs group assesses access charges to long distance carriers for the termination of landline originated calls 
though regulations generally entitle a carrier that terminates a call on behalf of another to be compensated for providing that service  these regulations were developed in a period where services of this nature were provided exclusively by local exchange carriers 
many long distance carriers have disputed the pcs group s assessment of these charges  as well as the corresponding rate at which the charges were determined 
in july  the fcc released a ruling affirming that nothing prohibited wireless carriers from imposing access charges for the use of their networks  however  the fcc also stated that inter exchange carriers could not be unilaterally required to pay these charges without a contractual obligation to do so 
the fcc referred the dispute back to the federal district court for the western district of missouri for a determination whether the pcs group has stated a claim under missouri state law where the case is still pending 
the fcc ruling was affirmed by the dc circuit court of appeals 
in light of this ruling  in the second quarter the pcs group recorded an additional provision for outstanding receivables related to amounts previously billed 
cost of services and products the pcs group s costs of services and products mainly include handset and accessory costs  switch and cell site expenses  customer service costs and other network related costs 
these costs increased in and in the increases are primarily due to network support of a larger customer base  higher minutes of use  expanded market coverage and increased handset unit costs 
these increases are somewhat offset by decreases in customer service expense 
handset and equipment costs were of total costs of services and products in and and in costs of services and products were of net operating revenue in  in and in selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense mainly includes marketing costs to promote products and services as well as salary and benefit costs 
sg a expense decreased in compared to an increase of in the decrease was primarily due to a decline in bad debt expense due to a better credit class mix  leading to lower write offs and higher recovery 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in other sales and marketing costs due to more competitive market conditions and expanded direct sales presence and the executive separation agreements 
the increase reflects increased marketing and selling costs associated with the pcs vision launch and increased bad debt expense 
sg a expense was of net operating revenues in  in and in bad debt expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was in  in and in reserve for bad debt as a percent of outstanding accounts receivable was in  in  and in the improvements were mainly driven by credit management policies initiated in the fourth quarter resulting in lower involuntary churn and improved receivables aging 
depreciation and amortization expense estimates and assumptions are used in setting depreciable lives 
assumptions are based on internal studies of use  industry data on lives  recognition of technological advancements and understanding of business strategy 
depreciation and amortization expense consists mainly of depreciation of network assets and amortization of intangible assets 
the definite life intangible assets include various customer bases  which became fully amortized in august depreciation and amortization expense increased in and in mainly reflecting depreciation of the network assets placed in service during and amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles ceased upon adoption of sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in sprint s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors 
sprint is susceptible to certain risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
sprint does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the communications industry is a capital intensive  technology driven business 
sprint is subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with its borrowings 
sprint selectively enters into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes on its debt 
approximately of sprint s debt at december  is fixed rate debt excluding interest rate swaps 
while changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because sprint intends to hold these obligations to maturity unless market conditions are favorable 
as of december   sprint held fair value interest rate swaps with a notional value of billion 
these swaps were entered into as hedges of the fair value of a portion of our senior notes 
these interest rate swaps have maturities ranging from to on a semiannual basis  sprint pays a floating rate of interest equal to the six month libor plus a fixed spread which averaged as of december   and received an average interest rate equal to the coupon rates stated on the underlying senior notes of 
assuming a one percentage point increase in the prevailing forward yield curve  the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the underlying senior notes would change by million 
these interest rate swaps met all the requirements for perfect effectiveness under derivative accounting rules  therefore  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows for any fair value fluctuations 
sprint performs interest rate sensitivity analyses on its variable rate debt including interest rate swaps 
these analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of million on the statements of operations and cash flows at december  while sprint s variable rate debt is subject to earnings and cash flows impacts as interest rates change  it is not subject to changes in fair values 
sprint also performs a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of its outstanding debt 
a decline in market interest rates would cause a million increase in fair market value of its debt to billion 
this analysis includes the hedged debt  but excludes sprint s equity unit notes 
foreign currency risk sprint also enters into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
sprint uses foreign currency derivatives to hedge its foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of its international subsidiaries 
the dollar equivalent of sprint s net foreign currency payables from international settlements was million and net foreign currency receivables from international operations was million at december  the potential immediate pre tax loss to sprint that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be approximately million
