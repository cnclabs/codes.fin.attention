the retail segment includes the franchised retail tire business conducted by big o tires  inc  as well as the operation of retail tire and service centers by tire kingdom  inc  merchant s  incorporated merchant s and ntw incorporated ntw 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  merchant s was acquired by tbc on april  and ntw and its operations were acquired from sears  roebuck co 
on november  the company s consolidated results from operations include the results from these companies since the date they were acquired 
the company s wholesale segment markets and distributes tbc s proprietary brands of tires  as well as other tires and related products  on a wholesale basis to distributors who resell to or operate independent tire dealers 
net sales which equals revenues from sales of products and services  plus franchise and royalty fees  less estimated returns  allowances and customer rebates increased during versus the level 
the million increase in total net sales included a million  or  increase for the retail segment and a million  or  decline for the wholesale segment 
the million increase in retail net sales during included a million increase in tire sales  a million gain in service revenues at company operated stores  and a million increase related to franchise and royalty fees and to sales of products other than tires 
the increased retail tire sales dollars included a gain in retail unit volume and a increase in the average retail tire sales price 
an increased number of franchised and company operated stores was the primary reason for the growth in retail tire volume and service revenues compared to the year earlier level 
at the end of december  the company had more franchised stores and more company operated stores than at december   with the acquisitions of merchant s in april and ntw in november adding and company operated stores  respectively  to the retail segment 
the acquired merchant s stores contributed million to retail sales during the nine months following the acquisition 
for the one month following the ntw acquisition  the acquired ntw stores contributed net sales of million 
the million decrease in net sales by the wholesale segment was primarily due to a decline in unit tire shipments that exceeded the impact of a increase in the average wholesale tire sales price 
the percentage of total sales attributable to tires declined from in to in  due to the impact of increased service revenues at company operated retail stores 
total unit tire volume in increased compared to the level 
in comparison  unit tire shipments for the replacement tire industry as a whole increased approximately during based on preliminary data 
average tire sales prices for the company as a whole increased compared to a year earlier  due largely to favorable mix changes 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in the improved overall gross profit percentage was largely due to the increased contribution from the retail segment and from the increased level of service revenues within the retail segment 
in addition  the company s growth over the past several years has resulted in greater purchasing leverage and an improvement in net purchase costs from tire suppliers 
gross profit percentages on sales by the company s retail segment increased from in to in wholesale margins as a percentage of sales increased from in to in distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in  due primarily to improved cost leveraging associated with the above mentioned acquisitions as well as improved efficiencies related to warehousing and product delivery 

table of contents selling  administrative and retail store expenses increased by million in compared to the increase was due principally to the greater number of company operated retail stores  including the stores added on april  as a result of the merchant s acquisition and the ntw stores added at the end of november expenses for such retail stores include payroll  operating and service related costs  in addition to certain other selling and administrative expenses 
excluding the impact of expenses associated with the company operated stores added during and  selling  administrative and retail store expenses increased by million  or  in compared to the level 
the increased expenses after deducting the impact of new stores was largely due to the impact of general inflation and various other cost increases in both the retail and wholesale segments 
net interest expense increased by million during compared to  due largely to a increase in average borrowing levels 
borrowings necessary to fund the acquisitions of merchant s and ntw caused average borrowing levels to increase  but the impact was somewhat offset by the company s cash from operations which totaled million during the year 
the impact of amended credit facilities associated with the acquisitions caused interest rate spreads to increase  however  average borrowing rates were lower in than in due to a decline in market interest rates 
in both and  the company made significant efforts to keep interest rate spreads and borrowing rates to a minimum 
net other income in was relatively unchanged compared to the year earlier level  increasing by 
a net decrease in the company s equity in operating results from joint ventures  which in included a  charge in connection with the exit from a joint venture  was more than offset by an aggregate increase in other income items 
the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in  due principally to reduced provisions for state income taxes 
earnings per diluted share were in and in earnings per diluted share in included a charge of approximately in conjunction with the above noted exit from a joint venture

the million increase in retail net sales during included a million increase in tire sales  a million gain in service revenues at company operated stores  and a million increase related to franchise and royalty fees and to sales of products other than tires 
the increased retail tire sales dollars included a gain in retail unit volume and a increase in the average retail tire sales price 
sales by the retail segment were favorably affected by an increase in the number of company operated and franchised stores in the company s retail systems 
at the end of  the company had a total of stores in its two retail systems compared to stores at december  the million increase in net sales by the wholesale segment included a increase in unit tire shipments and a increase in the average wholesale tire sales price 
the percentage of total sales attributable to tires was in compared to in total unit tire volume in increased compared to the level 
in comparison  unit tire shipments for the replacement tire industry as a whole declined approximately during average tire sales prices for the company as a whole increased in compared to  due principally to favorable mix changes 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in the improved overall gross profit percentage was largely due to the increased contribution from the retail segment 
in addition  the company s increased overall unit volume led to greater purchasing leverage with suppliers and a resulting improvement in net purchase prices 
gross margin percentages on sales by the company s retail segment increased to in from in  while wholesale margins were in compared to in 
table of contents distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in increases in total sales helped to leverage the company s warehousing and product delivery costs  since many of them  such as rent  do not vary in relation to sales 
selling  administrative and retail store expenses increased million in compared to  due principally to a greater number of company operated retail stores 
expenses for such retail stores include payroll  operating and service related costs  in addition to certain other selling and administrative expenses 
expenses in included amortization of goodwill and trademarks of million

excluding the impact of the amortization and pension charge in the prior year and the expenses associated with the new stores  selling  administrative and retail store expenses increased only in compared to the level  while net sales excluding the new stores increased 
net interest expense decreased million in compared to level  due principally to the combined effects of lower overall borrowing rates and lower average borrowings 
the company s average borrowing rate in was approximately lower than in  which was a reflection of lower market interest rates as well as efforts by the company to better manage receivables  inventories and other key components of working capital and thereby minimize interest rate spreads under its borrowing agreements 
average borrowings declined from the level  principally as a result of cash generated from operations and the above mentioned management efforts which allowed the company to reduce its debt to banks and other lenders 
net interest expense in included interest income of  related to refunds on amended tax returns filed in prior years 
net other income in was  less than in  due primarily to a decline in interest and service charge income from customers as well as a decrease in the company s equity in operating results from joint ventures 
the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in the lower effective rate in was due to reduced provisions for state income taxes as well as the impact of sfas no 
 since the majority of goodwill amortized in prior years was not deductible for tax purposes 
earnings per diluted share were in and in earnings per diluted share in included a charge of as a result of the previously noted writeoff of a prepaid pension asset and a credit of related to interest on prior year amended tax returns  in addition to the approximate charge related to the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets prior to the adoption of sfas no 
excluding the effects of these items  earnings in would have been approximately per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources on march   the company executed a new borrowing agreement with a group of banks  which replaced its existing bank borrowing facilities 
on november   the new agreement was amended and restated to enable the company to consummate its acquisition of ntw incorporated 
the amended and restated agreement includes a term loan facility and a revolving loan facility  both of which mature on april  the revolving loan facility allows the company to borrow up to million  with the option to increase that amount by an additional million 
at december   million was borrowed under the revolving loan facility and million was outstanding under the term loan facility 
the company s long term debt at the end of also included a total of million in senior notes 
of the total million borrowed at december  under these combined credit arrangements  million was classified as current on the company s balance sheet and the remaining million was considered noncurrent 

table of contents under its agreements with the respective lenders  the company is subject to certain financial covenants dealing with  among other things  the company s funded indebtedness  leverage  fixed charge coverage ratio  accounts receivable and inventories 
the agreements also include certain restrictions which affect the company s ability to incur additional debt  acquire other companies  make certain investments  repurchase its own common stock  sell or place liens upon assets  provide guarantees and pay cash dividends 
the company was in compliance with all of its borrowing covenants as of december  and for the year then ended 
the bank credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets and contain certain cross default provisions in conjunction with the senior notes 
the company had working capital of million at december  and its current ratio was 
during  total cash generated by operating activities totaled million 
the company s strong annual cash flow  solid financial position and sizable credit facilities allowed it to make the acquisitions of merchant s  incorporated on april  and ntw incorporated on november  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company was also able to fund capital expenditures totaling million in capital expenditures  including those during and  have historically been primarily for equipment and tire molds 
the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures at the end of the company expects to fund day to day operating expenses and normally recurring capital expenditures out of operating funds and its present financial resources 
the company expects its future growth to include additional strategic acquisitions such as the acquisitions during of merchant s and ntw 
significant future acquisitions could require additional capital resources and would involve new or amended credit facilities 
see forward looking statements and risks below  which identifies certain risks associated with the company s acquisition strategy  as well as many of the other factors which influence the company s operating results  its future growth potential and the industry in which it operates 
off balance sheet arrangements financial guarantees as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company s big o tires  inc subsidiary has provided certain financial guarantees associated with real estate leases and financing of its franchisees 
although the guarantees were issued in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its franchisees  they represent credit risk in excess of the amounts reported on the balance sheet as of december  the contractual amounts of the guarantees  which represent the company s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the franchisees  totaled  as of december  the credit risk associated with these guarantees is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to the franchisees 
big o evaluates each franchisee s creditworthiness and requires that sufficient collateral and security interests be obtained by the third party lenders or lessors  before the guarantees are issued 
there are no cash requirements associated with the guarantees  except in the event that an actual financial loss is subsequently incurred due to non performance by the franchisees 
variable interest entities as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in january and december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  and its revision  fin r  respectively 
fin and fin r provide guidance on the consolidation of entities whose equity holders have either not provided sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its own activities or do not possess certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
fin and fin r require the consolidation of these entities  known as variable interest entities vie s  by the primary beneficiary of the entity and also require certain disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
the primary beneficiary is the entity  if any  that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities  entitled to receive a majority of the vie s residual returns  or both 
the guidance of fin was immediately applicable for vie s created after january  in applying such guidance for purposes of determining whether an entity is a vie  the company has reviewed arrangements created after that date in which it has an economic interest in an entity or obligations to that entity  issued guarantees related to the liabilities of an entity  transferred assets to an entity  managed the assets of an entity  or leased assets from an entity or provided that entity with financing 
for any vie s created prior to february   the company will perform such analysis for the quarter ending march  as of december   the company has determined that it holds interests in certain vie s created after january  in connection with the franchise business activities conducted at its big o tires  inc subsidiary 
however  there were no material expected losses that the company would have been required to absorb nor were there any significant residual returns that the company expected to receive from such entities as of december   and therefore no vie s are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company as of december  and for the year then ended 

table of contents contractual obligations in addition to the debt obligations discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section  the company has operating and capital lease commitments as set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below summarizes the company s known material contractual obligations as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period within after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt short term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as certain financial statement disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies employed by the company  including the use of estimates and assumptions  are presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on its historical experience  together with other relevant factors  in order to form the basis for making judgements  which will affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and makes revisions as deemed necessary 
the following areas are considered to be of critical importance net sales net sales include revenues from sales of products and services  plus franchise and royalty fees charged to big o franchisees  less estimated returns  allowances and customer rebates 
sales are recognized at the time products are shipped or services are rendered and the estimated costs of returns  allowances and rebates are accrued at the same time 
historically  management s estimates for the costs of returns  allowances and rebates have not been materially different than the actual costs later incurred 
each big o franchisee is required to pay an initial franchise fee as well as monthly royalty fees of of gross sales 
initial franchise fees are deferred and recognized when all material services or conditions relating to the sale or transfer of the franchise have been substantially completed 
allowance for doubtful accounts and notes the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts and notes for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance is based on review of the overall condition of receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
the company evaluated its allowance for doubtful account at december  and determined that such amount was adequate but not excessive  based on facts and conditions known at that time 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate in such a way as to impair their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories  consisting of tires and other automotive products held for resale  are valued at the lower of cost or market 
certain inventories are valued using the last in first out method  however  the amount by which the current costs of those inventories exceeded the lifo value did not change significantly from december  to december  and thus the reported results would not have been materially different under a different inventory costing method 

table of contents goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets ceased the amortization of goodwill effective january   with charges being recorded only if impairment is found to exist 
at least annually  the company compares the carrying values of its reporting units to their fair value  with a reporting unit being defined as an operating segment or one level below a segment if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed regularly by management 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is required to be recognized 
no impairment to the recorded value of company s indefinite lived assets was found to exist as a result of the required testing 
warranty costs the costs of anticipated adjustments for workmanship and materials that are the responsibility of the company are estimated based on historical experience and charged against earnings currently 
management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or other information becomes available 
during  accruals for warranty expenses were adjusted to reflect changes in purchasing arrangements with certain suppliers that caused the company s responsibility for warranty costs to be lessened 
reserves for future warranty claims and service are included in liabilities in the balance sheets 
retirement plan obligations the values of certain assets and liabilities associated with the company s retirement plan obligations are determined on an actuarial basis and include estimates and assumptions such as the expected return on plan assets and discount rates 
discount rates are determined based on rates of high quality  fixed income investments 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets  differences between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate affect the amount of the pension expense recognized 
impact of recently issued accounting standards see recent accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the impact of recently issued accounting standards on the company s consolidated financial statements as of december  and for the year then ended  as well as the expected impact on the financial statements for future periods 
forward looking statements and risks this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities act of  as amended  including  without limitation  statements containing the words believes  expects  anticipates  estimates and words of similar import 
such forward looking statements relate to expectations for future financial performance  which involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors 
such factors include  but are not limited to changes in economic and business conditions in the world  increased competitive activity  consolidation within and among both competitors  suppliers and customers  unexpected changes in the replacement tire market  the company s inability to attract as many new franchisees or open as many company operated retail outlets as planned  changes in the company s ability to identify and acquire additional companies in the replacement tire industry and successfully integrate acquisitions and achieve anticipated synergies or savings  fluctuations in tire prices charged by manufacturers  including fluctuations due to changes in raw material and energy prices  product shortages and supply disruptions  changes in interest and foreign exchange rates  the cyclical nature of the automotive industry and the loss of a major customer or program 
it is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors 
any forward looking statements in this report are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the company in light of its experience and perception of historical trends  current conditions  expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances 
such statements are not a guarantee of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain financial market risks 
the most predominant of these risks is the fluctuation in interest rates associated with bank borrowings  since changes in interest expense affect the company s operating results 
at december   the company owed a total of million to banks under its credit facilities  of which million was not hedged by interest rate swap agreements and was thus subject to market risk for a change in interest rates 
if interest rates increase by basis points  the company s annual interest expense would increase by approximately  based on the outstanding balance which was not hedged at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company s interest rate swap agreements 
the company has no significant foreign currency translation risks  since its sales to customers located outside the united states are made and settled in us dollars
