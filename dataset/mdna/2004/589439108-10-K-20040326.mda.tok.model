table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a real estate company engaged in acquiring  owning and managing suburban office  retail shopping center and light industrial properties 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes  which requires  among a number of other organizational and operational requirements  that we distribute at least of our taxable income excluding capital gains to our stockholders 
from inception to march   we were advised and managed by the advisor 
since march   we have been self managed and self administered 
at december   we had a real estate portfolio of properties  including three light industrial properties totaling  square feet  one shopping center of  square feet  one restaurant facility of  square feet  three suburban office properties representing  square feet  and four properties held for sale totaling  square feet 
in addition to the above  we own a acre parcel of undeveloped land in garden grove  we intend to construct a multi tenant shopping center comprising approximately  square feet on this parcel 
all of our properties are located in california except for one shopping center in georgia 
until  our business focus was the ownership and operation of suburban office properties and light industrial buildings 
we have broadened our focus to include large shopping centers and properties outside of california 
we acquired an atlanta  georgia shopping center in october and may pursue other real estate opportunities 
many of our leases are triple net leases where the tenant is responsible for maintenance  taxes and insurance 
other than our becoming self managed and self advised as noted above  the most significant factors affecting our historical financial results are as follows sale of cerritos property 
on december   we sold our property in cerritos for a gross sales price of  and a gain of  during  the direct revenues in excess of direct expenses from the cerritos property contributed approximately  to our net income excluding the gain on the sale 
sale of chino property 
on november   we sold our vacant property in chino for a gross sales price of  and a gain of  during  the direct expenses in excess of direct revenues from the chino property decreased our net income by approximately  excluding the gain on the sale 
sale of vacaville property 
on august   we sold our vacant vacaville property for a gross sales price of  and a gain of  this gain incorporates a significant write down in the carrying value of the property made in during  the direct expenses in excess of direct revenues from the vacaville property decreased our net income by approximately  excluding the gain on the sale 
acquisition of northlake festival shopping center 
on october   we acquired the northlake festival shopping center  a  square foot shopping center on approximately acres of land in atlanta  dekalb county  in northeastern metropolitan atlanta 
northlake festival is currently approximately leased to tenants and accounts for approximately of our revenues 
we paid a total of approximately  million in cash and assumed the mortgage of approximately  million on the property 

table of contents refinancing of four properties in august on august   we refinanced the four loans secured by our folsom  irvine  sacramento horn road  and tustin properties 
the refinancing replaced approximately  of existing debt on four properties with approximately  of new debt  thus increasing the aggregate loan balance of these loans by approximately  the loans bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
this refinancing increased our fixed debt payments by approximately  per month 
sale of corona property 
on may   the lease expired on our corona property 
we sold this property in september to an unaffiliated buyer for  resulting in a gain of approximately  this property generated approximately our total gross rental income including revenue from discontinued operations before its lease expired 
sale of huntington beach property 
on april   we sold our huntington beach property to an unaffiliated buyer for  resulting in a gain of approximately  this property generated approximately our total gross rental income including revenue from discontinued operations before its sale 
we believe that the following factors and events will pose particular challenges for us in and beyond 
the following statements are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  and these factors and others are addressed in more detail in item  business risk factors that may affect future results 
existing and anticipated vacancies 
at present  our portfolio is approximately leased  although some tenants have vacated the lease premises and continue to pay rent 
in may  our lease with amc theaters comprising  square feet in our northlake festival property expires 
amc theaters has not occupied the space since  and we do not expect to be able to lease the space to another theater operator 
we are exploring options to reconfigure the space to be suitable for other uses  and may incur significant costs to complete such a renovation  including the lack of income during a construction and lease up period 
another tenant has vacated  square feet but is liable under the lease through july further  our lease on two sacramento properties expires in we may incur significant costs to re lease these spaces 
loss of revenues from disposed properties 
during  we sold three properties 
two of the three properties were vacant for all of  however  we recorded approximately  in revenues in for our cerritos property  which we sold on december  development of garden grove property 
part of our business plan and growth strategy involves divesting vacant and other select properties and redeploying the net cash proceeds into new properties where we expect the yield and long term growth to be greater 
consistent with that strategy  we have sold several properties as noted above  and we purchased a acre parcel of undeveloped land in garden grove 
we intend to construct a multi tenant shopping center comprising approximately  square feet on this parcel 
we believe that our cash flow from operations will begin to improve as we finish our new property under development and complete the leasing process 
debt maturities 
four of our loans mature in  with total balloon payments of approximately  in march  we paid the loan secured by our ontario property and extended the term of our garden grove banco popular loan to june the loans on our fresno and riverside properties are due in august and november  respectively 
lease with adelphia communications  inc in our ontario property 
adelphia has filed for bankruptcy protection  and although it is current in its lease payments with us  a bankruptcy court 
table of contents could terminate the lease 
further  various companies have filed liens against the property for remodeling work ordered by adelphia 
if the bankruptcy court terminates our lease and the payments to the creditors from the bankruptcy proceedings are less than their claims and the liens are indeed valid  then we would be responsible for the obligations 
as a result of property sales in  the purchase of land held for development in  the august refinancing and the october purchase of northlake festival  as of december   we had total assets of  total secured indebtedness of  total liabilities of  and a debt to total assets ratio of  calculated on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles 
because this calculation method reflects accumulated depreciation and does not reflect any appreciation of the properties beyond their cost  it may result in assets being valued at less than their fair market values as determined by the board of directors 
further  this calculation excludes the effects  if any  of the ground lease on the northlake festival property 
results of operations compared to we adopted sfas no 
as of january  and designated seven california properties as held for sale fresno  huntington beach  roseville  riverside  vacaville  and two sacramento properties and west del paso road 
we sold the huntington beach property in april and the corona property in september we sold the vacaville property in august on september   we designated the chino property as held for sale and removed the roseville property from the held for sale category 
in november and december we sold our chino and cerritos properties  respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have restated the prior results of the properties designated as held for sale and the properties we sold as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
operations for the years ended december  and represented full quarters of rental operations for all of our properties we classify as continuing operations  except for the northlake festival  which we acquired in october  and the banco popular property in garden grove  which we acquired in june the four properties designated as held for sale at december  and those properties sold in the three years then ended are included in the line items under discontinued operations income from operations with revenues netted against expenses 
rental revenue increased by  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the acquisition of the northlake festival property in october of  and its results included for all of and only for part of interest income decreased by  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to lower average balances maintained in interest earning assets and lower interest rates 
interest expense increased by  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to the august refinancing of four notes payable to balances approximately  higher  the higher balances were outstanding for all of as compared with only a part of  the addition of the note payable of approximately  secured by northlake festival for all of compared with only a part of  to a lesser extent  the replacement in the august refinancing of variable rate debt secured by our folsom and irvine properties by fixed rate debt bearing interest at higher rates  and the addition in june of  debt secured by the garden grove banco popular property 

table of contents general and administrative costs increased by  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase was principally due to higher legal expenses including amounts related to our defense of the claim by james prock  the costs of relocating our corporate office and our hiring one new employee and engaging a consultant to perform functions performed by the advisor in depreciation expense increased by  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due largely to an entire year of depreciation on the northlake festival property in while on only a part of ground rent increased by  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to an entire year of ground rent on the northlake festival property in while only a part of operating expenses increased by  in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due primarily to the addition of northlake festival property in october and including its operating costs for the all of and only a part of property tax expense increased  in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an entire year of property tax expense in related to the northlake festival property and only a partial year in discontinued operations gain on sale of rental real estate held for sale was  in the year ended december  from the sales of the vacaville  chino and cerritos properties 
during the year ended december   we recognized a gain of  from the sales of the huntington beach and corona properties 
discontinued operations income from operations decreased by  primarily due to a partial year of income for the huntington beach and corona properties in and no income in further  we recorded no income from the chino property in net income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the higher gains on sale of properties in  and including the results of the northlake festival for all of  and only part of the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding after adjusting for the november  one for three reverse stock split was  and  for years ended december  and  respectively 
for the reasons explained in the preceding paragraph  net income per share assuming dilution increased to for the year ended december  from net income per share of for the year ended december  compared to see our discussion above concerning our classification of properties as held for sale  as restated pursuant to fas operations for the years ended december  and represented full quarters of rental operations for all of our properties we classify as continuing operations  except for the northlake 
table of contents festival  which we acquired in october the four properties designated as held for sale during at december  and those properties sold in the three years then ended are included in the line items under discontinued operations with revenues netted against expenses 
rental revenue increased by  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the acquisition of the northlake festival property in october interest income decreased by  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to lower average balances maintained in interest earning assets and lower interest rates 
interest expense increased by  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to the august refinancing of four notes payable to balances approximately  higher than in  the addition of the note payable secured by northlake festival and  to a lesser extent  the replacement in the august refinancing of variable rate debt secured by our folsom and irvine properties by fixed rate debt bearing interest at higher rates 
general and administrative costs increased by  principally due to our conversion to a self advised and self managed reit  including the hiring of three employees  legal expenses related to two proxy statements  other general legal issues  securities filing fees and outsourcing functions previously performed by the advisor 
depreciation expense increased by  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due largely to the acquisition of the northlake festival property in october ground rent was  in  due to the ground lease for northlake festival  there was no ground lease expense in operating expenses increased by  in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due the addition of northlake festival property in october property tax expense increased  in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due the addition of northlake festival property in october during the quarter ended september   we determined  in conjunction with the advisor  that the total expected future cash flows from operations and the ultimate disposition of one property was less than its carrying value 
accordingly  we recorded a loss of  to reduce the property to their fair values  based on current appraisals 
we recorded no impairment loss in in march  we received  from banker s standard insurance company banker s standard in partial settlement of a lawsuit regarding banker s standard s responsibility to defend us in the market place cinema lawsuit 
banker s standard is also required to pay the subsequent legal costs of defending this action 
we had previously expensed these legal costs  and as a result  we took the proceeds of the settlement into income in march we had no similar item in discontinued operations gain on sale of rental real estate held for sale was  from the sales of the huntington beach and corona properties in we sold no properties in 
table of contents discontinued operations impairment loss was  in  we recorded no impairment loss in during the quarter ended september   we determined  in conjunction with the advisor  that the total expected future cash flows from operations and the ultimate disposition of five properties was less than their carrying values 
accordingly  we recorded the impairment loss in to reduce the properties to their fair values  based on current appraisals 
discontinued operations income from operations decreased by  primarily due to full years of income for the huntington beach and corona properties in and a partial year of income from the vacaville property in during  we recorded no income from the vacaville property and income for the partial year owned the huntington beach and corona properties 
net income for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  in year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the gain on sale of the huntington beach and corona properties in and the impairment loss recorded in the weighted average number of shares outstanding after adjusting for the november  one for three reverse stock split was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the reasons explained in the preceding paragraph  net income per share assuming dilution increased to in from a net loss per share of in inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our operations 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions  principal payment on notes payable and minor capital expenditures is our cash flows from operating activities 
to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  among other requirements  we must distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains 
accordingly  we currently intend to continue to make  but have not contractually bound ourselves to make  regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock 
as a policy  we keep cash balances on hand for reserves for unexpected cash requirements 
our primary sources for liquidity to fund asset acquisitions  major capital expenditures and balloon payments on notes payable are refinancing selected existing notes payable and the proceeds from selling selected properties 
further  we may attempt to obtain funding by issuing additional equity either in the form of common stock or through joint ventures 
the following table presents our contractual cash obligations as of december payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years over five years notes payable secured by rental real estate and real estate held for sale minimum payments due under the ground lease at the northlake festival property other total contractual cash obligations see note notes payable of the notes to the financial statements included in this report for a detailed description of our notes payable 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to the financial statements included in this report for a description of the terms of this ground lease 

table of contents in addition to the payments due in the table above  we also have employment contracts with our two officers 
at december   our total investments in rental real estate and rental real estate held for sale totaled  for the properties we own 
in addition  we own a parcel of land held for development valued at  depending upon the availability and cost of external capital  we anticipate making additional investments in suburban office  retail shopping center and light industrial properties  although we may make other types of investments 
we intend to fund new investments from existing cash balances subject to maintaining reasonable cash reserves  refinancing of selected existing mortgage debt to higher balances and the proceeds from asset sales 
we may consider other sources of possible funding  including joint ventures 
to increase our financial flexibility  we may obtain a revolving line of credit  although there can be no assurance we will be successful 
during  four of our loans are scheduled to mature  totaling approximately  we anticipate using a combination of existing cash balances  extension of the maturity date  refinancing including borrowing on unencumbered properties and or property sales to meet the scheduled maturities 
to date  we have paid the balance due on the loan secured by our ontario property using existing cash balances  and extended the term of the loan secured by our garden grove banco popular property to june and believe we will be able to extend the maturity date on that loan further 
we cannot assure you we will be able to use existing cash balances  extension of the maturity date  refinancing including borrowing on unencumbered properties and or property sales to meet the scheduled maturities on the remaining two loans 
we do not believe we will be able to use our ontario property as security for a loan until the bankruptcy court accepts our lease with the tenant if the lease is accepted at all  and we do not believe that a formal acceptance or rejection of the lease will occur by september  further  we anticipate the following significant needs for cash during the remainder of and we plan to build an approximate  square foot shopping center on our parcel of land in garden grove using a construction loan 
we anticipate using a construction loan to fund the construction costs 
we may renovate the  square foot space vacated by amc theaters after the lease expires in may to a use other than a theater  at a significant cost 
we believe our liquidity and various sources of capital are sufficient to fund operations including capital expenditures and leasing commissions  meet debt service and dividend requirements under the internal revenue code for reit status and finance future investments  although we cannot assure you we will be successful in obtaining such capital 
we believe our properties are in good condition without significant deferred maintenance obligations  and many are leased under triple net leases  which reduce our risk pertaining to excessive maintenance and operating costs 
however  we anticipate we will continue to require outside sources of financing to meet our liquidity needs beyond  such as scheduled debt repayments including balloon payments on our debt and property acquisitions 

table of contents on september   our stockholders voted to amend and restate our bylaws to  among other items  eliminate the limit on our leverage 
unlike our previous certificate of incorporation and bylaws  these new organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur 
we have adopted a policy that we shall not incur any additional liabilities if  after giving effect to the additional liabilities  total liabilities would exceed of what the board of directors believes is the fair market value of our portfolio 
if we decide to change this policy to increase the percentage of debt we incur above of our overall portfolio fair market value  we will implement the change only after we seek and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority in voting power of our outstanding shares 
cash flows in our cash resources increased  during the year ended december  during  cash provided by operating activities was  primarily from net income adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization 
investing activities in resulted in a  source of cash resources primarily from proceeds from the sale of the vacaville  chino and cerritos properties and offset in part by the acquisition of land held for development and related costs and the purchase of the banco popular property

for the year ended december  financing activities used  due largely to dividends totaling  and principal payments on notes payable totaling  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates based on different assumptions or conditions 
we define critical accounting policies as those that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
a summary of our critical accounting policies follows 
additional discussion of accounting policies that we consider significant  including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below  can be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize minimum rents on the straight line method over the terms of the leases  as required under statement of financial accounting standard no 
certain of the leases also provide for additional revenue based on contingent percentage income which is recorded on an accrual basis once the specified target that triggers this type of income is achieved 
the leases also typically provide for tenant recoveries of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other operating expenses 
these recoveries are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable costs are incurred  except for several tenants where the revenue is recognized when the revenue is billable to the tenant under the lease 
rents due  but not yet collected  are recognized to the extent determined by management to be collectible 
we believe that the likelihood of collection of amounts over six months past due is low 
as of december  we had approximately  in receivables over six months old and we have provided approximately  for uncollectible receivables 
real estate 
we record real estate assets at the lower of cost or fair value if impaired 
we evaluate the recoverability of our investment in real estate whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired 
our assessment of recoverability of our real estate assets includes  but is not limited to recent operating results  expected cash flows and our plans for future operations 
properties classified as held for sale are segregated from rental real estate in our financial statement presentation 
we stop recording depreciation on a property once it is classified as held for sale 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which requires that the assets and liabilities and the results of operations of any properties which have been sold during  or otherwise qualify as held for sale as of december   be presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in both current and prior periods presented 
the property specific real estate classified as held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal costs 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our investments in real estate are carried at cost and are periodically evaluated for indicators of impairment 
the evaluation of impairment and the determination of values are based on several factors  and future events could occur which would cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and a reduction in carrying value to estimated fair value is warranted 
critical accounting estimates 
we believe the critical accounting estimates we make relate to the valuation of our properties for impairment and legal and other contingencies 
we believe these estimates are judgmental and not subject to strict  quantifiable analysis 
as appropriate  we engage counsel and other parties  to assist us in making these estimates 
new accounting pronouncements on may   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no

fin no

fin no 
expands on the accounting guidance of statements no 
  and and incorporates without change the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 which is being superseded 
fin no 
affects leasing transactions involving residual guarantees  vendor and manufacturer guarantees  and tax and environmental indemnities 
all such guarantees will need to be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements starting with the period ending after december  for guarantees issued after december   the fair value of the obligation must be reported on the balance sheet 
existing guarantees will be grandfathered and no fair value of the obligation of them will be recognized on the balance sheet 
the adoption of fin no 
did not have impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin no 
explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interest in a variable entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
fin no 
requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
fin no 
is effective immediately for variable interest entities after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtained an interest after that date 
fin no 
applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we are in the process of assessing the effect of fin no 
and do not expect the implementation of fin no 
to have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   only a  note payable carried a variable interest rate 
as of december   all of our debt instruments had fixed rates  and we did not have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates until those loans mature 
unless and until we obtain other variable rate loans  changes in market interest rates will only affect the rate of that one variable rate loan 
we have in the past and may in the future  however  obtain loans that bear interest at a variable rate 
in the past  we have borrowed to support general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we periodically evaluate the level of variable rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including our assessment of the current and future economic environment 
we did not have any derivative financial instruments at december  or the fair values of our financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash  other assets and liabilities other than notes payable approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature  terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates 
the fair value of notes payable is estimated based on a discounted cash flow analysis with interest rates similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements 
under this analysis  the fair value of our notes payable exceeded their carrying value by approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
we had  and in variable rate debt outstanding at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt would be immaterial to our results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december  and further  many of our fixed rate loans have significant balloon payments that would need to be refinanced at maturity  possibly at unfavorable rates 
we cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt and  therefore  our exposure to market risk 
we can give no assurances that fixed rate  long term debt will be available to us at advantageous pricing 
consequently  our future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
