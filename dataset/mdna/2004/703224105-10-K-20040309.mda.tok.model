item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview patina oil gas corporation patina or the company is a rapidly growing independent energy company engaged in the acquisition  development and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties within the continental united states 
the company s properties and oil and gas reserves are principally located in relatively long lived fields with well established production histories 
the properties are primarily concentrated in the wattenberg field wattenberg of colorado s denver julesburg basin d j basin  the mid continent region of southern oklahoma and the texas panhandle  and the san juan basin 
the company seeks to increase its reserves  production  revenues  net income and cash flow in a cost efficient manner primarily through i further wattenberg development  ii accelerated development of the recently acquired mid continent and san juan basin properties  iii selective pursuit of further consolidation and acquisition opportunities  and iv generation and exploitation of exploration and development projects with a focus on projects near currently owned productive properties 
during  the company achieved excellent results in several key areas daily production increased from mmcfe per day in to mmcfe per day in the company s wattenberg properties contributed of this increase  while the full year benefit of production from mid continent properties acquired in and additional production from mid continent properties acquired in contributed nearly 
revenues increased from million in to million in primarily due to the increase in production and a increase in realized oil and gas prices 
net income increased from million in to million in cash flow from operations increased from million in to million in proved reserves increased from tcfe to tcfe  with acquisitions and ongoing development and performance revisions contributing bcfe and bcfe  respectively 
in addition  oil and gas prices increased reserves bcfe 
the reserve increases were offset by bcfe of production and bcfe of reserves sold 
exclusive of the impact of higher prices  the company replaced over of production in at a finding and development cost of per mcfe 
the company spent million on the further development of its properties  as follows expenditures drillings deepenings refracs trifracs recompletions wattenberg mid continent san juan central and other total the company spent million on acquisitions which were primarily comprised of million  million  and million on the elysium  lnp  and cordillera acquisitions  respectively 
through these acquisitions and those completed in late  the company materially diversified its asset base by increasing its presence in the mid continent and adding a third core area in the san juan basin 
based on a million capital budget for combined with the benefits of the acquisitions made in  the company expects production to increase by approximately to in the coming year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes revenues from the sale of oil and gas in the period delivered 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for specific receivables we judge unlikely to be collected 
the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
leasehold costs are capitalized when incurred 
unproved properties are assessed periodically within specific geographic areas and impairments in value are charged to expense 
exploratory expenses  including geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized  but charged to expense if the well is determined to be unsuccessful 
costs of productive wells  unsuccessful developmental wells and productive leases are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis through depletion  depreciation and amortization expense over the life of the associated oil and gas reserves 
oil and gas property costs are periodically evaluated for possible impairment 
impairments are recorded when management believes that a property s net book value is not recoverable based on current estimates of expected future cash flows 
depletion  depreciation and amortization of oil and gas properties and the periodic assessments for impairment are based on underlying oil and gas reserve estimates and future cash flows using then current oil and gas prices combined with operating and capital development costs 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
the company regularly enters into commodity derivative contracts and fixed price physical contracts to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility 
the contracts  which are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counter parties which management believes to be of high credit quality  may take the form of futures contracts  swaps or options 
the oil and gas reference prices of these contracts are based upon oil and natural gas futures  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices received by the company 
currently  the company s oil and gas swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 
factors affecting financial condition and liquidity liquidity and capital resources during  the company spent million on the further development of properties and million on acquisitions 
acquisition expenditures were primarily comprised of million and million on the elysium and le norman partners purchases  respectively  and million on the cordillera acquisition  exclusive of million attributed to the warrants issued 
development expenditures included million in wattenberg for the drilling or deepening of j sand wells  the drilling of codell wells  and performing codell refracs  codell trifracs and recompletions  million on the further development of the mid continent le norman  le norman partners  bravo  and certain cordillera properties for the drilling or deepening of wells  and performing eight refracs and recompletions  million in the san juan basin  and million on other properties primarily in illinois and kansas  primarily for drilling or deepening wells and performing recompletions 
these acquisitions and projects  and the continued success in production enhancement allowed production to increase over the prior year 
on october   the company expended million on the cordillera acquisition 
the cordillera properties are primarily located in the mid continent  the san juan basin  and the permian basin and primarily produce gas 
the decision to increase or decrease development activity is heavily dependent on the prices being received for production 
at december   the company had billion of assets 
total capitalization was million  of which was represented by stockholders equity and by bank debt 
during  net cash provided by operations totaled million  as compared to million in million and million prior to changes in working capital  respectively 
at december   there were no significant commitments for capital expenditures 
based upon a million capital budget for  the company expects production to continue to increase in the coming year 
the level of these and other future expenditures is largely discretionary  and the amount of funds devoted to any particular activity may increase or decrease significantly  depending on available opportunities and market conditions 
the company plans to finance its ongoing development  acquisition and exploration expenditures and additional equity repurchases using internal cash flow  proceeds from asset sales and bank borrowings 
in addition  joint ventures or future public and private offerings of debt or equity securities may be utilized 
the company s primary cash requirements will be to finance acquisitions  fund development expenditures  repurchase equity securities  repay indebtedness  and general working capital needs 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables  including the level of production and oil and gas prices  and there can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures or that increased capital expenditures will not be undertaken 
the company believes that borrowings available under its credit agreement  projected operating cash flows and the cash on hand will be sufficient to cover its working capital  capital expenditures  planned development activities and debt service requirements for the next months 
in connection with consummating any significant acquisition  additional debt or equity financing will be required  which may or may not be available on terms that are acceptable to the company 
the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than one year years years after years total long term debt firm transportation agreement non cancelable operating leases total contractual cash obligations banking the following summarizes the company s borrowings and availability under its revolving credit facility in thousands december  borrowing base outstanding available revolving credit facility in january  the company entered into an amended bank credit agreement the credit agreement 
the credit agreement is a revolving credit facility for up to million 
the amount available under the facility is adjusted semi annually  each may and november  and equaled million at december  patina had million available under the credit agreement at december  the company may elect that all or a portion of the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to i the libor rate for one  two  three or six months plus a margin which fluctuates from to  or ii the prime rate plus a margin which fluctuates from to 
the margins are determined by a debt to ebitda ratio  as defined 
the weighted average interest rate under the facility was during and at december in october  the company entered into interest rate swaps effective november  for one year and two year periods 
each contract is for million principal with a fixed interest rate of on the one year term and on the two year term  respectively  payable by the company and the variable interest rate  the three month libor  payable by the third party 
the difference between the company s fixed rates of and and the three month libor rate  which is reset every days  is received or paid every days in arrears 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants  including but not limited to a maximum total debt to ebitda ratio  as defined  and a minimum current ratio 
it also contains negative covenants  including but not limited to restrictions on indebtedness  certain liens  guaranties  speculative derivatives and other similar obligations  asset dispositions  dividends  loans and advances  creation of subsidiaries  investments  leases  acquisitions  mergers  changes in fiscal year  transactions with affiliates  changes in business conducted  sale and leaseback and operating lease transactions  sale of receivables  prepayment of other indebtedness  amendments to principal documents  negative pledge causes  issuance of securities  and non speculative commodity hedging 
at december  and  the company was in compliance with the covenants 
borrowings under the credit agreement mature in january  but may be prepaid at anytime 
the company had a restricted payment basket under the credit agreement of million as of december   which may be used to repurchase equity securities  pay dividends or make other restricted payments 
cash flow the company s principal sources of cash are operating cash flow and bank borrowings 
the company s cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices 
pricing volatility will be somewhat reduced as the company has entered into hedging agreements covering part of its expected production for   and  respectively 
the million of development expenditures for were funded entirely with internal cash flow 
the million of acquisition expenditures were largely funded by bank borrowings  somewhat offset by current year cash flow from operations 
the capital budget of million  comprised primarily of million of development expenditures in wattenberg  million in the mid continent region  million in the san juan basin  and million on the central and other properties  is expected to increase production by approximately to 
the purchase price for the elysium acquisition was million and the purchase price for the lnp properties was million 
on october   the company acquired the cordillera properties for million  comprised of million of cash funded with borrowings under the company s bank facility and the issuance of five year warrants to purchase  shares of patina common stock for per share 
on december   the company had million outstanding under its bank facility 
as such  exclusive of any other acquisitions or significant equity repurchases  management expects to reduce long term debt and fund the development program with internal cash flow 
net cash provided by operating activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash flow from operations decreased in due to the decline in average oil and gas prices  partially offset by increased production 
cash flow from operations increased in due to the increase in oil and gas equivalent production and the increase in average oil and gas prices received 
lease operating expenses  production taxes  general and administrative expenses and interest expense all increased as a result of the acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of le norman and bravo  the first quarter of elysium and le norman partners  and the fourth quarter of cordillera 
operating cash flows in and were benefited by million and million  respectively  due to the tax deduction generated from the exercise and same day sale of stock options 
net cash used in investing activities in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in were largely comprised of development expenditures of million million in wattenberg and the initiation of our grassroots projects  somewhat offset by million of proceeds from sales of assets  primarily elysium s properties in the lake washington field in louisiana 
the increase in expenditures in was due to the mid continent acquisitions for total cash consideration of million and the increase in development expenditures to million million in wattenberg 
the further increase in expenditures in was primarily due to incurring million of acquisition costs primarily related to elysium  le norman partners  and cordillera acquisitions  the million increase in development expenditures on the mid continent properties  the million increase in development expenditures in wattenberg  and the million increase in development expenditures on the central and other properties 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  while net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings 
during  the combination of operating cash flow  proceeds from the exercise of the company s warrants for million  refinancing of the elysium loan  and proceeds from the sale of the lake washington properties  allowed the company to repay million of bank debt  repurchase million of equity securities and fund capital development and acquisition expenditures of million 
in  the company borrowed million of bank debt 
these borrowings were used in conjunction with operating cash flow and proceeds of million from stock purchase plan purchases and the exercise of company stock options to fund the le norman and bravo acquisitions and capital development expenditures of million 
during  the combination of operating cash flow  bank borrowings of million and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock  allowed the company to fund net capital development and acquisition expenditures of million  repurchase million in common stock and pay common stock dividends of million 
capital requirements during  million of capital  net of million of property sales  was expended  including million on development projects and million on acquisitions 
development expenditures represented approximately of internal cash flow defined as net cash provided by operations before changes in working capital 
the company manages its capital budget with the goal of funding it with internal cash flow 
the development capital budget of million is expected to increase production by approximately to 
based on current futures prices for oil and natural gas  the company expects its capital program to be funded with internal cash flow 
the purchase price for the elysium acquisition was million  the purchase price for the lnp properties was million  and the purchase price for the cordillera acquisition was million  comprised of million of cash funded with borrowings under the company s bank facility and the issuance of five year warrants to purchase million shares of patina common stock for per share 
as such  exclusive of any other acquisitions or significant equity repurchases  management expects to reduce long term debt in development and exploration activities are highly discretionary  and  for the foreseeable future  management expects such activities to be maintained at levels equal to or below internal cash flow 
hedging the company periodically enters into interest rate derivative contracts to help manage its exposure to interest rate volatility 
the contracts are placed with major financial institutions or with counterparties which management believes to be of high credit quality 
the company interest rate swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into libor swap contracts to fix the interest rate on million of the company s libor based floating rate bank debt for one year and an additional million for two years 
at december   the net unrealized pretax gains on these contracts totaled   gain net of  of deferred taxes based on libor futures prices at december  the company regularly enters into hedging agreements to reduce the impact on its operations of fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
all such contracts are entered into solely to hedge prices and limit volatility 
the company s current policy is to hedge between and of its production  when futures prices justify  on a rolling to month basis 
at december   hedges were in place covering bcf at prices averaging per mmbtu and million barrels of oil averaging per barrel 
the estimated fair value of the company s oil and gas hedge contracts that would be realized on termination approximated a net unrealized pretax loss of million million loss net of million of deferred taxes at december  the combined net unrealized losses from the company s oil  gas  and interest rate hedges are presented on the balance sheet as a current asset of  a non current asset of million  a current liability of million  and a non current liability of million based on contract expiration 
the gas contracts settle monthly through december while the oil contracts settle monthly through december gains or losses on both realized and unrealized hedging transactions are determined as the difference between the contract price and a reference price  generally nymex for oil and the colorado interstate gas cig index  anr pipeline oklahoma anr index  panhandle eastern pipeline pepl index and el paso san juan epsj index for natural gas 
transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases in oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold 
any ineffective portion of such hedges is recognized in earnings as it occurs 
net pretax gains relating to these derivatives were million and million in and and a pretax loss of million in  respectively 
effective january   the unrealized gains losses on open hedging positions were recorded at an estimate of fair value which the company based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price  generally nymex  cig  anr  pepl or epsj on the company s balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity 
inflation and changes in prices while certain costs are affected by the general level of inflation  factors unique to the oil and gas industry result in independent price fluctuations 
over the past five years  significant fluctuations have occurred in oil and gas prices 
although it is particularly difficult to estimate future prices of oil and gas  price fluctuations have had  and will continue to have  a material effect on the company 
the following table indicates the average oil and gas prices received over the last five years and highlights the price fluctuations by quarter for and average price computations exclude hedging gains and losses and other nonrecurring items to provide comparability

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which provides guidance for financial accounting and reporting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires the recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred  as opposed to when the entity commits to an exit plan under eitf no 
the statement was effective for the company in the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires a guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under certain guarantees 
additionally  fin requires a guarantor to disclose certain aspects of each guarantee  or each group of similar guarantees  including the nature of the guarantee  the maximum exposure under the guarantee  the current carrying amount of any liability for the guarantee  and any recourse provisions allowing the guarantor to recover from third parties any amounts paid under the guarantee 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements for both interim and annual periods ending after december  the fair value measurement provisions of fin are to be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on the reported results 
sfas no 
was effective for the company s year ended december  and for interim financial statements commencing in the adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument within its scope as a liability or asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise was effective and adopted by the company on july  as the company has no such instruments  the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the fasb is currently evaluating the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
the fasb is considering whether the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
require registrants to classify costs associated with mineral rights  including both proved and unproved lease acquisition costs  as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other oil and gas property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
historically  the company has included oil and gas lease acquisition costs as a component of oil and gas properties 
in the event the fasb determines that costs associated with mineral rights are required to be classified as intangible assets  approximately million of the company s oil and gas property acquisition costs may be required to be separately classified on its balance sheets as intangible assets 
however  the company currently believes that its results of operations and financial condition would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with existing successful efforts accounting rules and impairment standards 
the company does not believe the classification of oil and gas lease acquisition costs as intangible assets would have any impact on the company s compliance with covenants under its debt agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing domestic price for oil and spot prices applicable to the rocky mountain and mid continent regions for its natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
pricing volatility is expected to continue 
natural gas price realizations during  exclusive of any hedges  ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf 
oil prices  exclusive of any hedges  ranged from a monthly low of per barrel to a monthly high of per barrel during a significant decline in prices of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in  a reduction in oil and gas prices  excluding oil and gas quantities that were fixed through hedging transactions  would have reduced revenues by million 
if oil and gas future prices at december  had declined by  the net unrealized hedging losses at that date would have decreased by million from million to million 
the company regularly enters into commodity derivative contracts and fixed price physical contracts to help manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility 
the contracts  which are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counter parties which management believes to be of high credit quality  may take the form of futures contracts  swaps or options 
the oil and gas reference prices of these contracts are based upon oil and natural gas futures  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices received by the company 
currently  the company s oil and gas swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 
the company entered into various swap contracts for oil based on nymex prices  recognizing losses of million and million in and  respectively  and a gain of million in  related to these contracts 
the company entered into various swap contracts for natural gas based on the colorado interstate gas cig  anr pipeline oklahoma anr  panhandle eastern pipeline pepl  and the el paso san juan epsj indexes  recognizing a loss of million in  and gains of million and million in and  respectively  related to these contracts 
at december   the company was a party to swap contracts for oil based on nymex prices covering approximately  barrels of oil per day for at fixed prices ranging from to per barrel 
these swaps are summarized in the table below 
the overall weighted average hedged price for the swap contracts is per barrel for the company also entered into swap contracts for oil for and as of december   which are summarized in the table below 
the net unrealized losses on these contracts totaled million based on nymex futures prices at december  at december   the company was a party to swap contracts for natural gas based on cig  epsj  anr and panhandle eastern pipeline pepl index prices covering approximately  mmbtu s per day for at fixed prices ranging from to per mmbtu 
the overall weighted average hedged price for the swap contracts is per mmbtu for the company also entered into natural gas swap contracts for as of december   which are summarized in the table below 
the net unrealized losses on these contracts totaled million based on futures prices at december at december   the company was a party to the fixed price swaps summarized below oil swaps nymex natural gas swaps cig index time period daily volume bbl bbl unrealized gain loss thousands daily volume mmbtu mmbtu unrealized gain loss thousands natural gas swaps anr pepl indexes natural gas swaps epsj index time period daily volume mmbtu mmbtu unrealized gain loss thousands daily volume mmbtu mmbtu unrealized gain loss thousands the company is required to provide margin deposits to its counterparties when the unrealized losses on its oil and gas hedges exceed the credit thresholds established by its counterparties 
at december  and  the company had zero and million  respectively  on deposit with its counterparties 
these amounts are included in inventory and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
basis differentials the company sells the majority of its gas production based on the colorado interstate gas cig index 
the realized price of the company s gas and that of other rocky mountain producers has historically traded at a discount to nymex gas 
this discount is referred to as a basis differential and averaged per mmbtu discount from nymex in  ranging from a discount of per mmbtu in january to a discount of per mmbtu in october the cig basis differential for averaged per mmbtu discount from nymex  ranging from a discount of per mmbtu in december to a discount of per mmbtu in march based on futures prices as of december   the cig basis differential for averages an per mmbtu discount  ranging from a discount of per mmbtu in january to a discount of per mmbtu in december the decrease in the cig basis differential is believed to be in part due to the pipeline expansions made in primarily the kern river expansion of mmbtu per day in may resulting in an increase in gas pipeline capacity for transportation out of the rocky mountain region 
interest rate risk at december   the company had million outstanding under its credit facility with an average interest rate of 
the company may elect that all or a portion of the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to i libor for one  two  three or six months plus a margin which fluctuates from to or ii the prime rate plus a margin which fluctuates from to 
the weighted average interest rate under the facility approximated during assuming no change in the amount outstanding at december   the annual impact on interest expense of a ten percent change in the average interest rate would be approximately  net of tax 
as the interest rate is variable and is reflective of current market conditions  the carrying value approximates the fair value
