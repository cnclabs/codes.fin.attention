item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the more detailed business information and consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this report and in the documents that we incorporate by reference into this report 
this report may contain certain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this information involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors 
overview we are a leading provider of voice over internet protocol  or voip  telephony services 
since we began operations in  we have evolved from a pioneer in developing pc to telephone calling services over the internet to a next generation provider of high quality voice and enhanced communication services throughout the world 
our strategic investors include idt corporation  a global telecommunications  media and technology company  and liberty media corporation  a global media company 
idt and liberty media together own ntop holdings  llc  which  as of october   holds an aggregate of percent of our outstanding capital stock and percent of our aggregate voting power 
idt is the controlling member of ntop holdings  through which it effectively controls us 
in addition  in november of  we closed an underwritten common stock offering  which  in addition to the million shares offered to the public and our underwriters  included million shares offered to each of idt and liberty media 
taken together with its control of ntop holdings  the million shares idt purchased in the offering  and an additional million shares of our common stock held directly by idt  idt controls percent of our aggregate voting power 

back to contents our corporate structure is primarily organized around two wholly owned operating subsidiaries  netphone global services and netphone cable telephony 
netphone global services delivers voip telephony services to businesses and consumers directly and through its global distribution network of over resellers in over countries capitalizing on the growth  quality  flexibility and cost advantages of voip technologies 
netphone cable telephony offers cable and other broadband operators a complete suite of services  enabling them to deliver residential phone service to their customers with comparable quality  features and functionality to that offered by traditional telephone companies 
our segment information for fiscal is provided below netphone global services netphone cable telephony corporate other total in thousands revenue segment income loss capital expenditures total assets substantially all of our revenue has been  and is currently  generated by netphone global services 
we expect revenue generated by netphone cable telephony to represent a growing percentage of our total revenue over the next few years 
in fiscal  international customers accounted for approximately percent of our revenue 
we expect that international customers will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
during the past year  netphone global services continued to focus its activities on opportunities in emerging markets where we believe our services can command higher margins 
specifically  we have de emphasized relatively low margin services and during the second quarter of fiscal we exited our disposable calling card business 
although these initiatives have resulted in a decline in our revenue since fiscal  netphone global services has maintained its gross margin percentages and now generates cash from its operating activities in excess of its capital expenditures while in the prior year the capital expenditures exceeded cash generated from its operating activities 
during the past year  our netphone cable telephony business has grown  and we expect it will begin to represent an increasing proportion of our revenue in future years 
netphone cable telephony signed its first contract with liberty cablevision of puerto rico on october   and is actively marketing its services to a wide array of cable and broadband operators in the us  europe and latin america whom we believe may prefer to buy our services rather than build their own cable telephony service 
netphone cable telephony works with cable and broadband operators to deploy an integrated  tested and operational telephony service  including customized operations support systems  network interfaces  carrier interconnects  telecommunications methods and procedures and real time service assurance  including x network operations support 
netphone cable telephony offers cable and broadband operators a range of services  strategic deployment and economic alternatives 
we expect our telephony agreements will reflect multi year arrangements  with terms of up to five years 
our primary business model  what we have previously called our hosted service  has the operator outsourcing the planning  development and aspects of the ongoing operation of cable telephony to us 
we have seen limited interest in our franchise model  under which we buy back from the cable operator its cable telephony rights and subscribers at pre negotiated periods and valuations 
while we offer a variety of deployment options to our customers  in most cases  the operator will outsource the planning  development and other aspects of the ongoing operation of cable telephony to us 
in a typical arrangement  the operator will collect revenue from its customers and pay us a fee on either a per subscriber basis or on a percentage of revenue basis for providing our integrated services  as well as ongoing maintenance and support fees 
in addition  the operator will reimburse us for our telecommunications costs plus a margin 
these costs include the set up and ongoing management of local and long distance interconnection and termination  the costs of any dedicated circuits and the recurring cost of maintaining phone numbers and other support services  such as and operator assisted calling 

back to contents our fees on a particular contract will depend on a number of variables  including the size of the operator s telephony footprint  its ability to sell telephony services to its customers  the complexity of the deployment and the amount of local versus long distance calls terminated by those customers 
in most cases  the operator will be responsible for sales and marketing  customer activation  customer support  billing and collection  plant engineering and service technicians and any regulatory costs associated with offering telephony 
in a typical arrangement  the operator will also be responsible for the capital expenditures associated with the cost of new service installation  the cost of equipment deployed at the subscriber s premises and the upgrade to its existing cable modem termination server 
we will bear the capital expenditures and operating expenses for the planning  design  procurement  deployment and operation of the voip telephony infrastructure 
our capital expenditures include the hardware and software costs of integrating our services and systems with the operator s systems 
during fiscal  netphone cable telephony generated million in revenue  primarily related to sales of equipment to one cable telephony operator 
we expect to continue to incur significant costs and capital expenditures to fund the anticipated growth of netphone cable telephony 
the revenue and expenses associated with this business will depend on the number of customers and contracts we establish and the type of service we provide to our customers 
while we are currently in various stages of negotiations with a number of potential customers  each customer has different financial  operational and technical requirements  and  therefore  the time to finalize particular relationships will vary based upon the individual requirements of the respective customers 
while we believe we have the ability to deliver dial tone within a day period with most us cable operators  we expect the implementation period to vary from customer to customer depending upon their respective requirements  the time required to negotiate definitive agreements  the time required for individual customers to implement engineering plans and install hardware and operating systems 
we cannot predict with certainty that we will reach definitive agreements with any customers we are currently in discussions with within a particular time period  or at all 
while we expect netphone cable telephony will initially adversely affect the profitability of our company as a whole  we believe the business will contribute to our earnings in the future as it achieves scale 
we cannot predict when this will happen  or be certain that it will happen at all 
on october   we entered into a binding memorandum of understanding with idt  which requires us to issue million shares of our class a common stock to idt at the time we execute definitive telecommunications services and related agreements with idt 
once issued  the shares will be held in escrow to secure idt s performance obligations under the agreements and will be released to idt in equal annual installments over five years 
the shares are subject to variable accounting treatment and  therefore  must be marked to market each quarter 
consequently  we recorded a charge of million to non cash services related to this agreement during fiscal  which represents the market value of the million shares that we may release from escrow to idt for services and benefits provided by idt during fiscal the million shares have been included in the total number of our class a common stock shares reported as issued and outstanding as of july  in our audited financial statements  although such shares have not yet been issued to idt 
no definitive agreement has been executed as of october  the parties efforts to establish detailed terms and conditions continue 
see related party transactions below 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of asset sand liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  fixed assets  access line costs  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  often as a result of the need to 
back to contents make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
for a further discussion of these and other accounting policies  please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition 
with respect to our netphone global services business segment  our international communications service revenue is recognized as service is provided  that is  as minutes are used 
our retail sales revenue  which consists primarily of prepaid calling card revenue  is also recognized as service is provided  that is  as minutes are used  or when service fees are charged 
we also recognize revenue from pre payments for our services after we conduct evaluations of outstanding remaining pre payment balances and determine  based on historical data  whether such balances are likely to be utilized 
the sale of equipment with software necessary to provide our services is recognized when such products are delivered  collection of payments is assured and there are no significant future obligations 
with respect to our netphone cable telephony business segment  to date  we have not recognized significant revenue from our cable telephony business 
however  during fiscal revenue recorded by netphone cable telephony primarily related to the sale of equipment  which is recognized when such products are delivered  collection of payments is assured and there are no significant future obligations 
netphone cable telephony also began delivering cable telephony and maintenance services to customers of liberty cablevision of puerto rico  inc lcv  an affiliate of liberty media corporation under an agreement executed in october netphone cable telephony recognizes such revenue as telecom services are used and when maintenance and support services are provided 
in addition  netphone cable telephony charges lcv a per subscriber activation fee based on customer contracted commitment levels 
these fees are collected and revenue deferred and recognized over the remaining life of the agreement 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate several factors each quarter  which we consider important and which we believe could trigger an impairment review 
these factors include significant underperformance relative to historical performance or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant adverse changes in the business climate in which we operate  and loss of a significant contract 
if we determined that the carrying value of certain long lived assets or identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would determine whether an impairment exists based on the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we would record an impairment loss based on such difference 
expense recognition compared to capitalized costs 
purchases that exceed  provide benefit to future periods and have useful lives greater than one year are capitalized 
all other purchases are expensed in the period the underlying goods and or services are received 
specifically equipment  furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from five to ten years  computer software is amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of five years or the term of the related agreement  and software development costs for the internal development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional costs would be capitalized 
we capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software 
these costs consist of payments made to third parties and the direct compensation costs of only those employees working on such software development projects 
capitalized internal use software costs are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of five years or the useful lives of the internal use software 

back to contents restructuring accruals 
in fiscal   and  we recorded charges related to restructuring within markets  eliminating employee positions and other strategic changes 
the accruals recorded include estimates pertaining to employee termination costs and remaining lease obligations for closed facilities 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our statement of operations for the periods indicated fiscal year ended july  in thousands total revenue costs and expenses direct cost of revenue exclusive of items shown below selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization non cash services provided by idt attributable to direct cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative non cash compensation attributable to selling  general and administrative restructuring  severance  impairment and other items settlement of cisco litigation acquired in process research and development total costs and expenses income loss from operations interest income  net income loss on equity investments and other expense  net income loss before minority interests minority interests net income loss redeemable common stock accretion net income loss available to common stockholders comparison of fiscal years ended july  and revenue 
our revenue is derived from per minute charges to our customers  primarily on a pre paid basis  and the sale of voip equipment and services to consumers  resellers  idt  other carriers and cable operators 
revenue decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal prior to the current fiscal year  we significantly reduced our workforce and scaled back certain low margin services  including wholesale termination of telecommunications traffic 
the net decrease in revenue was primarily driven by these actions  as well as a significant reduction in our sales of disposable calling cards  a line of business we discontinued in the second quarter of fiscal disposable calling cards generated low margin revenue of million during fiscal  compared to million during we have been focusing our business activities on more strategic  higher margin services  such as enterprise solutions and rechargeable calling card and prefix dialing services  which we are pursuing through netphone global services  and cable and other broadband telephony services  which we are pursuing through netphone cable telephony 
direct cost of revenue 
our direct cost of revenue consists primarily of network costs associated with carrying our customers traffic on our network and leased networks  and routing their calls through a local telephone company to reach their final destination 
it also includes the cost of purchasing  storing and shipping voip devices 
most of these costs were incurred within netphone global services 
however  in fiscal  netphone cable telephony recorded million in installation and operating costs relating to 
back to contents its deployment to one cable telephony customer 
overall  direct costs of revenue decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  these costs decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal while the dollar cost decrease is primarily attributable to lower revenue  we are also realizing cost reductions  despite a million inventory obsolescence charge taken during the second quarter of fiscal  from a more efficiently structured and utilized network and from more aggressively priced termination contracts  some of which included retroactive credits for a portion of previously terminated traffic 
our decision to discontinue issuing new disposable calling cards during the second quarter of fiscal has allowed us to reduce higher direct costs associated with this service and to pursue other  more profitable service offerings 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists of salaries of our employees and associated benefits  and the cost of insurance  legal  rent  utilities and other services  expenses associated with acquiring customers  including commissions paid to our sales force  advertising costs  travel  entertainment  and referral fees 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to continuing cost management initiatives  and elimination of expenses directly related to restructured operations 
as a percentage of total revenue  these costs remained flat at percent for both fiscal and fiscal we expect to incur significant selling  general and administrative expense related to the future growth of our netphone cable telephony business 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due primarily to million in fiscal year end depreciation adjustments related to the accelerated write off of certain capitalized software during the fourth quarter of fiscal excluding this write off  depreciation during fiscal would have increased by million or percent due to increased depreciation incurred on certain capitalized software brought into service during fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  these costs  excluding the aforementioned adjustments in fiscal  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase is due primarily to a decrease in revenue in fiscal as compared with fiscal non cash services provided by idt attributable to direct cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative 
in fiscal  we recorded an expense of million related to the receipt of services from idt to be paid for through the issuance of class a common stock 
this expense  which was recorded for the first time during the fiscal quarter ended january   is based on a binding memorandum of understanding executed on october  with idt  whereby  in exchange for attractive pricing on local and inter exchange network access  termination  origination and other related services  as compared to third party vendors  access to idt s facilities and other benefits  we have agreed to issue million shares of our class a common stock to idt at the time we enter into a definitive agreement 
this charge represents the market value of million class a common shares that we may issue and subsequently release from escrow to idt for services and benefits provided by idt during the twelve months ended july   as these shares must be marked to market each quarter based on their current market value 
it is anticipated that the million shares will be issued upon execution of definitive agreements and will be held in escrow to secure idt s performance obligation  and  subsequently  released to idt in equal annual installments over five years  with the first release scheduled for october  or the date definitive agreements are signed  whichever is later 
see related party transactions below 
non cash compensation attributable to selling  general and administrative 
non cash compensation decreased from million in fiscal to a net expense reduction of million for fiscal there were two primary factors driving this year over year change  variable accounting for repriced stock options and the fiscal amortization of the discount of adir shares 
based on changes in our stock price  we recorded a charge of million relating to repriced options in fiscal and a reversal of million of previously recognized non cash compensation expense relating to stock options in fiscal if our stock price increases  we will incur charges over the vesting period with respect to repriced options  until those options are exercised  cancelled or expire 
the second factor related to the decrease in non cash compensation expense is a million charge recorded during fiscal for the amortization of the discount of adir shares sold to netphone and adir employees in fiscal the total discount of approximately million was amortized over the vesting period of such shares 
the remaining unamortized discount at 
back to contents the close of fiscal of million was written off as a component of other income  net  during the first quarter of fiscal  as a result of the termination of all remaining adir employees 
for more information regarding adir  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report restructuring  severance  impairment and other items 
restructuring  severance  impairment and other items decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the following table summarizes the charges included in restructuring  severance  impairment and other items in the statements of operations year ended july  in thousands exit and other costs separation agreements of former ceo  cfo and coo workforce reductions impairment charges  including recovery on assets held for sale reserve adjustments total in the first half of fiscal  both our chief executive officer and chief financial officer resigned as we began to implement an overall long term restructuring plan  which would scale down our operations  organize us to compete more efficiently  and allow us to redirect our focus and resources towards a more profitable business plan 
during the two years since  we have executed our plan and implemented a series of strategic workforce reductions  sold business units and long lived assets  as well as impaired such assets and goodwill 
as we continue to execute our plan  we are realizing lower costs and identifying more attractive revenue opportunities 
while the majority of our restructuring costs were incurred during fiscal and  we continued to incur these costs during fiscal and those expenses within these charges that required cash outlays were funded through current operations 
during fiscal  we incurred a million charge to exit our disposable calling card business  recorded various impaired lease and settlement costs totalling million  recorded executive separation charges of million  employee separation costs of million and an asset impairment charge of million 
except for the closing costs associated with the exiting of our disposable calling card business  all fiscal restructuring charges relate to pre fiscal restructuring initiatives 
partially offsetting these charges were net reserve reversals of million  and a million recovery of equipment that was previously written off 
during fiscal  we initiated several additional restructurings  which resulted in higher charges related to workforce reductions in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  the charges related to the separation agreements of the former ceo  cfo and our chief operating officer  who resigned in july  decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  as components of certain long term agreements became fully amortized  and the number of agreements decreased 
exit costs were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to charges incurred for exiting various locations and eliminating various equipment and network build outs 
additionally  we recorded a net recovery of impaired assets during fiscal  compared with various asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal lastly  in fiscal  we settled various contractual obligations for amounts less than previously established reserves 
this resulted in million of favorable reserve adjustments  as compared with million of similar adjustments in fiscal income loss from operations 
we recorded a loss from operations of million in fiscal as compared to income from operations of million in fiscal this change is primarily due to the net gain of million that we realized from the settlement of our cisco litigation  which we recorded during the first quarter of fiscal excluding this one time gain  we would have realized a loss from operations  
back to contents in fiscal totalling million  which when compared with our loss from operations in fiscal  reflects a reduction in our overall loss from operations of million or percent 
this decrease is attributable to a million decrease in non cash compensation expense and to a million decrease in restructuring expenses 
these reductions were partially offset by new expenses that were incurred during fiscal  such as non cash services provided by idt 
interest income  net 
interest income consists primarily of interest earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities  which is partially offset by interest expense incurred on long term obligations 
interest income  net remained flat at million in fiscal as compared with fiscal this is primarily a result of higher average cash balances held during fiscal relative to last year  which was offset by incremental interest expense incurred through our deutsche bank obligation described below in liquidity and capital resources that was executed during the fourth quarter of fiscal income on equity investments and other expense  net 
income on equity investments and other expense  net  which includes the losses or gains resulting from non operating transactions increased from income of million recorded in fiscal to income of million recorded in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the non cash  non recurring million gain realized from the buyout of adir s remaining minority interest holders during the first quarter of fiscal  and to a million gain on the sale of our interest in exact advertising llc  which we recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal partially offsetting these gains  is a mark to market adjustment of million related to netphone shares held by deutsche bank based on a decrease in our stock price at fiscal year end 
these shares may serve to reduce our overall debt obligation to deutsche bank  however the amount of reduction in the debt obligation that these shares will provide us will vary according to the price of our stock 
comparison of fiscal years ended july  and revenue 
our revenue is primarily derived from per minute charges to our customers  primarily on a pre paid basis  and the sale of voip equipment and services to consumers  resellers  idt and other carriers 
our aggregate revenue decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in revenue primarily resulted from the fact that we significantly reduced our sales of disposable calling cards  which generated low margin sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we also significantly reduced our workforce in  and scaled back certain low margin services  including wholesale termination of telecommunications traffic 
direct cost of revenue 
our direct cost of revenue consists primarily of network costs associated with carrying our customers traffic on our network and leased networks and routing those calls through a local telephone company to reach their final destination 
it also includes the cost of purchasing  storing and shipping voip devices 
most of these costs were incurred within the units that now comprise netphone global services 
direct cost of revenue decreased by percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  total direct costs increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal while the dollar cost decrease is primarily attributable to lower revenue and one time connectivity reserve reversals  which are no longer necessary due to service disconnections  we are also realizing cost reductions from a more efficiently structured and utilized network and from more aggressively priced termination contracts 
the slight increase in the percentage of direct costs compared to revenue is due to the remaining fixed network backbone infrastructure costs still required to service a significantly reduced revenue base 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists of the salaries of our employees and associated benefits and the cost of insurance  legal  rent  utilities and other services  expenses associated with acquiring customers  including commissions paid to our sales force  advertising costs  travel  entertainment  referral fees and amounts paid in connection with revenue sharing arrangements 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to the aforementioned restructurings 
as a percentage of total revenue  these costs decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the portion of selling  general and administrative expense driven by payroll costs decreased during fiscal as the number of full time employees on staff dropped from on july  to on july  selling  
back to contents general and administrative expense related to our netphone cable telephony business was million in fiscal we expect to incur significant selling  general and administrative expense to continue to fund the growth of our netphone cable telephony business in the future 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased percent  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to an impairment charge for long lived assets recognized during the quarter ended april  and to the lower demand for capital spending during fiscal  which came from more efficient utilization of existing assets 
as a percentage of total revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal non cash compensation attributable to selling  general and administrative 
non cash compensation charges from the issuance of stock options decreased percent from million in fiscal to million for fiscal this decrease was primarily caused by lower compensation expense related to fewer below market price options that vested during fiscal as compared to a larger number of below market price options that became fully vested in fiscal in addition  due to our various restructurings  a number of previously granted options have been forfeited  which has served to further reduce non cash compensation expense in fiscal on december   the board of directors approved the repricing of options outstanding under netphone s amended and restated stock option and incentive plan 
the repriced options are subject to variable accounting treatment and therefore must be marked to market each quarter 
during fiscal and we recorded charges of million and million respectively  related to these repriced options if our stock price increases  we will continue to incur charges until the options are exercised  canceled or expired 
lastly  we recorded million and million during fiscal and  respectively  for the amortization of the discount of adir shares sold tonetphone and adir employees in fiscal the total discount of approximately million was amortized over the vesting period of such shares 
as of july   million of this discount has been amortized 
the remaining unamortized discount of million was written off against the remaining minority interest balance during fiscal when we liquidated adir 
for a further discussion of adir  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
as a percentage of total revenue  non cash compensation costs increased from percent for fiscal to percent for fiscal this increase was due primarily to a percent decrease in revenue 
restructuring  severance  impairment and other items 
restructuring  severance  impairment and other items decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the following table summarizes the charges included in restructuring  severance  impairment and other items in the statements of operations year ended july  in thousands workforce reductions exit and other costs separation agreements of former ceo  cfo and coo impairment charges  including recovery on assets held for sale reserve adjustments total in the first half of fiscal  both our chief executive officer and chief financial officer resigned 
these events led to the development of an overall long term restructuring plan  which would scale down our operations  organize us to compete more efficiently  and allow us to redirect our focus and resources towards a more profitable business plan 
during the two years since  we have executed our plan and implemented a series of strategic workforce reductions  sold business units and long lived assets  as well as impaired such asset sand goodwill 
as we continue to execute our plan we are realizing lower costs and identifying more reliable revenue opportunities 
while the majority of our restructuring costs were incurred during fiscal and fiscal  we continued to incur these costs during fiscal however  we expect that these 
back to contents expenditures will decrease prospectively 
those expenses within these charges that required cash outlays were funded through current operations 
in april  norman klugman  our former chief operating officer  announced his intention to resign and terminated his employment with us in july during fiscal  we recorded a million charge related to a severance agreement reached with mr 
klugman 
mr 
klugman waived all of his rights under his employment agreement 
as a result of our plan to restructure our operations and eliminate various lines of development  an impairment review of our long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets was conducted as of april   in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded impairment charges as indicated below 
the impairment charges were calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeded their fair values 
fair value was estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows 
the decrease in restructuring  severance  impairment  and other items in fiscal compared with fiscal  is due mainly to various impairment charges recorded in fiscal  including an million impairment of assets  an million impairment of goodwill and a million impairment of intangible assets 
additionally  we initiated several restructurings during fiscal  which resulted in higher charges related to workforce reductions in fiscal compared to fiscal also  the charges related to the separation agreements of the former ceo and cfo decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as components of the agreements became fully amortized 
also  exit costs were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to charges incurred for exiting various locations and eliminating various equipment and network build outs 
lastly  reserve adjustments reduced fiscal charges due to settlement of various contractual obligations for amounts less than previously established reserves 
settlement of cisco litigation 
in august  netphone and its adir subsidiary consummated the settlement of their lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey against cisco and a cisco executive who had been a member of the board of directors of adir technologies  inc  our majority owned subsidiary 
the suit arose out of the relationships that had been created in connection with cisco s and netphone s original investments in adir and out of adir s subsequent purchase of netspeak  inc in august the parties settled the suit and all related claims against cisco and the cisco executive in exchange for i the transfer  during the first quarter of fiscal  to netphone of cisco s and softbank asia infrastructure fund s respective percent and percent interests in adir  and ii the payment by cisco  during such quarter  of million to netphone and adir 
as a result of this settlement  we recognized a gain of million during fiscal consisting of a million reduction in minority interests as a result of the transfer of the adir shares  receipt of settlement proceeds of million less compensation expense of million 
no income taxes have been provided for with respect to the gain as we have sufficient net operating loss carry forwards to offset the gain 
in fiscal  we recorded million of legal and other expenses related to this settlement 
acquired in process research and development 
for fiscal  purchased in process research and development  or ipr d  represented the value assigned in a purchase business combination to research and development projects of the acquired business that had commenced but had not yet been completed at the date of acquisition and which have no alternative future use 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fasb interpretation no 
 amounts assigned to ipr d meeting the above stated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price of the business combination 
accordingly  charges totaling million were recorded during fiscal as part of the allocation of the purchase price related to the acquisition of netspeak by adir  our then majority owned subsidiary 
ipr d relates primarily to advanced telephony software products for internet protocol  or ip  networks 
the valuation of ipr d included both cost and income valuation approaches  and utilized replacement cost and discounted cash flow methodologies for various aspects of the analysis 
the calculations were based on estimates of operating earnings  capital charges  and working capital requirements to support the cash flows 
back to contents attributed to the technologies 
discount rates reflecting the stage of development  complexity and the risk associated with each technology were used to value ipr d 
development of the major components of the ipr d were completed during the second quarter of fiscal effective february   further research was suspended while adir reevaluated the products anticipated attractiveness relative to current market conditions 
it was ultimately determined that the aspects of the ipr d necessary to bolster the technological development of netphonecable telephony s product offerings were in place and no further development related to the ipr d would be initiated 
income loss from operations 
we recorded a loss from operations of million in fiscal compared to income from operations of million in fiscal the decrease in loss from operations is primarily due to operating expenses decreasing at a faster rate than revenue  lower restructuring  severance  impairment and other related expenses  and a net gain of million from the settlement of the cisco litigation recorded during fiscal interest income  net 
interest income consists primarily of interest earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest income decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the reduction primarily resulted from lower cash balances and interest rate reductions 
income loss on equity investments and other expense  net 
income loss on equity investments and other expense  net  which includes the losses or gains resulting from non operating transactions  was a loss of million in fiscal and income of million in fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a loss relating to an other than temporary decline in value of several of our cost method investments resulting in a charge of approximately million  as well as a loss relating to the sale of equipment of approximately million 
the other income realized in fiscal is primarily a mark to market gain on shares of our common stock held by a lender  as is more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report

back to contents during the second quarter of fiscal  we executed an agreement with union telecard alliance  llc uta  a subsidiary of idt  which ended uta s distribution of netphone disposable calling cards effective december   and provided for an orderly wind down over a two year period of our disposable calling card business 
this resulted in exit costs of million to compensate uta for estimated obligations associated with the netphone disposable calling cards currently in the marketplace 
these exit costs were recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as restructuring  severance  impairment and other items during the three months ended january  pursuant to the terms of our agreement with uta  the parties will settle the aforementioned obligations over a two year period ending december   through monthly reconciliations of on going wind down activities  with final settlement to be completed by february  consequently  sales of prepaid disposable calling cards to idt affiliates in fiscal were nominal  compared with sales of million and million recorded in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our corporate headquarters and several other facilities are leased from idt 
during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal idt charged us million  million and million  respectively  in facilities lease fees 
idt s treasury function provides investment management services relating to our portfolio of marketable securities 
during fiscal  million in securities purchases and sales were settled through idt  while during fiscal  million in securities sales were settled through idt 
no such investment management services were provided during fiscal on occasion  we have aggregated long distance minutes and other services purchases with idt 
we outsource some of our administrative and support functions to idt 
these administrative functions include  but are not limited to  tax consulting services  payroll services  and internal audit support services 
in most cases  fees for services are negotiated on a cost recovery basis 
in march  we entered into an intellectual property legal services agreement with idt  pursuant to which we will receive legal services from idt related to a wide variety of intellectual property matters  including  but not limited to  patent and trademark prosecution and technology protection and development 
based upon this agreement  we will pay idt a percentage of licensing fees we may receive related to specific technologies as a result of idt s assistance in these matters  in addition to a  monthly fee for these services 
the agreement has a two year term  which can be terminated with days notice upon a material breach  or with days notice at the discretion of either party 
in addition  we have entered into a tax services agreement pursuant to which we pay idt  a month for tax services 
we are currently negotiating other service agreements with idt 
during fiscal and  we incurred fees totalling million and million for all such administrative and support services 
no charges were incurred during fiscal on occasion  we provide other services to idt  based on the need for such services 
during fiscal and we charged idt reimbursement fees for project support services totalling million and million  respectively  for each fiscal year 
no fees were charged during fiscal on october   we entered into a binding memorandum of understanding mou with idt  which requires us to issue million shares of our class a common stock to idt at the time we execute a definitive telecommunications services and related agreements with idt 
no definitive agreement has been executed as of october  the parties efforts to establish detailed terms and conditions continue 
once issued  the shares will be held in escrow to secure idt s performance obligations under the agreements and are to be released to idt in equal annual installments over five years  with the first release scheduled for october  or the date we enter into definitive agreements  whichever is later 
during the second quarter of fiscal  idt started providing us with services and benefits under the terms of the mou 
the issuance of the million shares is subject to variable accounting treatment and  therefore  the shares must be marked to market each quarter based on their current market value 
consequently  we recorded charges of million to non cash services provided by idt related to this agreement during fiscal  which represents the market value of million shares that we may issue and subsequently release from escrow to idt for services and benefits provided by idt during the aforementioned periods 
we determined that non cash services provided by idt are attributable to direct cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expense 
however  given that the services provided by idt do not 
back to contents individually have readily identifiable market values  and that the variable accounting treatment will result in different values being ascribed to the same services from period to period  we believe differentiating between direct cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative is not practicable 
therefore we have classified the non cash services provided by idt in a separate line in the consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with eitf topic d  grantor balance sheet presentation of unvested  forfeitable equity instruments granted to a nonemployee  the million shares we may release from escrow for services received from idt have been included in the total number of class a common stock shares reported as issued and outstanding as of july   in our consolidated financial statements  although such shares have not yet been issued to idt

liberty media corporation on october   one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  netphone cable telephony  llc nct and liberty cablevision of puerto rico  inc lcv  an affiliate of liberty media corporation  executed a cable telephony production agreement 
according to the terms of this agreement  nct is to provide cable telephony services to lcv s customers  and nct will act as lcv s agent in requisitioning  configuring  staging and installing all infrastructure and technology components that would facilitate these telecommunication services 
we recorded million in revenue from lcv during the third quarter of fiscal of which million reflects infrastructure and related technology components installed during the quarter that are necessary for lcv to broadly distribute our services 
we widened our service offerings to an increased number of lcv s customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal agreements with officers pursuant to stephen m 
greenberg s  our chief executive officer ceo  employment agreement  dated july   to help defray the tax expense of a grant of  shares of restricted stock  we loaned him an amount necessary to pay such taxes 
we granted the ceo a loan for  in september  with a term of three years and an interest rate equal to the applicable short term federal rate 
repayment would be accelerated if the ceo sold any of his  shares of restricted stock or upon the termination of his employment agreement 
the ceo repaid this loan in full  plus interest  in the first quarter of fiscal in april  we loaned the sum of million to our ceo 
the loan bears interest at a market rate and principal and interest are due on april  maturity date 
the loan is non recourse to the ceo and is secured by options to purchase  shares of our common stock granted to the ceo in april under certain circumstances  the board of directors may request the ceo to exercise sufficient options and sell sufficient stock to pay the unpaid balance of the loan 
in addition  the board may request that the ceo not sell the stock  which will result in the unpaid loan and interest balance being reduced based upon a formula set forth in the loan agreement 
on the maturity date  the ceo will have to return to us all or a portion of the unexercised options and or shares of unsold stock and his unpaid loan and accrued interest balance will be reduced based upon a formula set forth in the loan agreement 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the number of options the ceo will ultimately receive  we are accounting for the options using a variable accounting model until the options are exercised or returned to us 
furthermore  due to the non recourse nature of the loan  we are recording compensation expense for the million principal amount of the note over its three year maturity period 
however  total compensation 
back to contents expense will be calculated at each reporting date as the greater of the compensation expense resulting from i variable accounting treatment of the options  or ii amortizing the million loan balance over the maturity period of the loan 
we recorded compensation expense of million in fiscal and and million in fiscal  relating to this loan 
pursuant to an employment agreement with our former general counsel dated january   we guaranteed that the value as defined in the agreement of  options to purchase our common stock held by our then general counsel would be at least million on january  to the extent the value of such options was less than million  we would pay our then general counsel the difference in cash 
on january   the value of the  options was million 
as required by the agreement  we paid million to our then general counsel at that time 
we had amortized the million guaranteed option value over the three year term of the agreement  less the intrinsic value of the stock options as of each fiscal quarter end 
due to the higher stock price on january  as compared to july   we reversed million of previously recorded non cash compensation expense  as a result of this agreement 
during fiscal  we recorded non cash compensation expense of million related to this agreement 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have satisfied our cash requirements through a combination of cash flow from operating activities and sales of equity securities 
our cash requirements have also been satisfied through our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 
the following table provides our cash flow data for the twelve months ended july  and twelve months ended july  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of july  we reported total cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  and marketable securities of million and working capital of million 
of the million  million in short term restricted cash and million in long term restricted cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities were held as collateral for various letter of credit obligations  the majority of which related to our purchase of aplio  sa from the stockholders of aplio 
on may   these obligations were assigned to deutsche bank aglondon 
our payment obligations to deutsche bank are secured by standby letters of credit from a us commercial bank  which are  in turn  collateralized by million in marketable securities held by the bank 
the letters of credit expire on august  these restricted marketable securities are included in restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities long term on our balance sheet 
for more information regarding this transaction  please see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
net cash used in operating activities was million during fiscal  compared with million used during fiscal the increase in cash flow used in operating activities is primarily due to receipt of million  in the first quarter of fiscal  from the settlement of litigation with cisco 
thus  the million of cash used in operating activities in fiscal represents a million improvement compared to million used in operating activities in fiscal  excluding the cash received from the settlement of litigation with cisco 
this improvement was primarily attributable to favorable changes in working capital as a result of the timing of receipts and disbursements  as well as reduced operating costs 
net cash used in investing activities increased from million during fiscal to million in fiscal this increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to more cash being available for investment following our issuance of million shares of common stock as part of a public offering we 
back to contents conducted during the second quarter of fiscal described below 
our capital expenditures decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal however  we anticipate that capital expenditures will significantly increase as netphone cable telephony acquires fixed assets to build its infrastructure and deploy equipment related to contract obligations it may enter into with cable and broadband operators 
the net cash proceeds from the sale of marketable securities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the net cash used for purchases of marketable securities increased from million during fiscal to million during fiscal net cash provided by used in financing activities increased from million during fiscal to million in fiscal this change is due primarily to million in net proceeds from the issuance of shares through an underwritten common stock offering at per share on november  million shares were issued to the public  an additional million shares were issued as part of an over allotment option exercised by the underwriters  and an aggregate of million shares were purchased by idt corporation and liberty media corporation  our controlling shareholders 
we have used  and intend to use  the net proceeds from the common share issuance for general corporate purposes  capital expenditures  and working capital  including funding our netphone cabletelephony business 
we believe that  based upon our present business plans  our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements  and to fund any potential operating cash flow deficits in the foreseeable future 
we believe that as the expected growth in our netphone cable telephony subsidiary accelerates or if we acquire the business or assets of another company  we may need to raise additional capital from equity or debt sources 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain such additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our anticipated expansion  which could have a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated  limited purpose or variable interest entities 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
additional detail regarding these items is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report

back to contents other long term debt represents a million debt obligation to deutsche bank which matures in market gains on shares held by deutsche bank will serve to reduce our overall obligation if our stock price increases above a pre established price 
this obligation is secured by standby letters of credit from a us commercial bank  which are  in turn  collateralized by million of marketable securities held by the bank effects of inflation due to relatively low levels of inflation over the last several years  inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments such as investments and debt that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
we are not materially exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments nor do we hold securities for trading or speculative purposes 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in cash equivalents 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
our reported financial results may vary significantly based upon fluctuations in our stock price 
our long term obligation with deutsche bank changes based upon our stock price 
if our stock price decreases  this will increase our overall obligation 
if our stock price increases  this will decrease our overall obligation 
in addition  we have repriced stock options and granted restricted shares that require variable accounting treatment and  therefore must be marked to market each quarter based on their current fair value
