overview the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand microsoft corporation 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and the accompanying notes notes 
we generate revenues  income and cash flows by developing  manufacturing  licensing  and supporting a wide range of software products for many computing devices 
our software products include operating systems for servers  personal computers pcs  and intelligent devices  server applications for distributed computing environments  information worker productivity applications  business solutions applications  and software development tools 
we provide consulting and product support services  and we train and certify system integrators and developers 
we sell the xbox video game console and games  pc games and peripherals 
online communication services and information services are delivered through our msn portals and channels around the world 
we also research and develop advanced technologies for future software products 
delivering breakthrough innovation and high value solutions through our integrated platform are the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth 
we believe that over the last few years we have laid a foundation for long term growth  delivering innovative new products  creating opportunity for partners  improving customer satisfaction with key audiences  putting some of our most significant legal challenges behind us  and solidifying internal processes 
our focus in fiscal is building on this foundation and executing well in key areas  including continuing to innovate on our integrated software platform  delivering compelling value propositions to customers  responding effectively to customer and partner needs  and continuing to focus internally on product excellence  business efficacy  and accountability across the company 
key market opportunities include meeting the needs of a growing worldwide base of pc users  which we project will top billion by  delivering new scenarios such as collaboration  authoring  communicating  planning  and analysis for information workers  continuing to compete against linux and unix for commercial workloads  reducing complexity and cost for it professionals and developers  delivering it services for smaller business  and consumers  creating and delivering business solutions for small and mid market segments  creating non pc consumer electronics in areas such as mobile phones  handheld devices  home entertainment and tv  delivering compelling entertainment experiences in areas such as music  tv  movies  photos  and games  expanding online advertising  and advances in search  music and other information services  delivering integrated communications services for consumers and information workers 
for fiscal  we believe industry wide factors such as pc unit growth and the success of non commercial software could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition 
pc unit growth was very strong in fiscal  increasing approximately from fiscal we do not expect similar growth to occur in fiscal page 
table of contents part ii item we believe that pc unit shipments will grow to  resulting in a forecasted fiscal client revenue growth rate that we believe will be between and 
we continue to watch the evolution of open source software development and distribution  and continue to differentiate our products from competitive products including those based on open source software 
we believe that microsoft s share of server units grew modestly in fiscal  while linux distributions rose slightly faster on an absolute basis 
the increase in linux distributions reflects some significant public announcements of support and adoption of open source software in both the server and desktop markets in the last year 
to the extent open source software products gain increasing market acceptance  sales of our products may decline  which could result in a reduction in our revenue and operating margins 
additionally  due primarily to our announced special dividend and quarterly dividend payments  if continued  we expect investment balances and resulting investment income to decrease significantly in fiscal we have approximately billion in original upgrade advantage contract value that will reach their expiration dates in the first quarter of fiscal this revenue was recognized over the last two years and in the first quarter of fiscal the contract period expires

revenue operating income our revenue growth for fiscal was driven by licensing of windows client operating systems through oems  windows server operating systems  office  and other server applications as a result of growth in pc and server hardware shipments  and the continuing impact from multi year licensing that occurred prior to the transition to our licensing program in the first quarter of fiscal we estimate growth in pc shipments was during fiscal  reflecting global economic improvement  which led to strength in the consumer segment in the first half of fiscal and to replacement pc and notebook sales in the enterprise segment in the second half of fiscal we estimate that total server hardware shipments grew  with windows server shipments growing faster than the overall sector at in fiscal the net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in fiscal  primarily due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the us dollar 
had the rates from the prior year been in effect in fiscal  translated international revenue earned in local currencies would have been approximately billion lower 
we hedge a portion of our international currency exposures  thereby reducing our overall translation exposure 
prior to the july  licensing transition date  we experienced a significant increase in multi year licensing arrangements as customers enrolled in our maintenance programs  primarily upgrade advantage 
revenue growth in fiscal was driven primarily by multi year licensing that occurred before the licensing transition date in the first quarter of fiscal the revenue growth also reflected a million or increase associated with oem licensing of microsoft windows operating systems and a million or increase in revenue from microsoft xbox video game consoles 
revenue growth in fiscal was led by the addition of billion of xbox video game system revenue and billion of revenue growth from microsoft windows xp professional and home operating systems 
for fiscal  the operating income decline of million was primarily caused by the billion of charges related to the sun microsystems settlement and a fine imposed by the european commission in the third quarter of fiscal and billion of stock based compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal operating income was positively influenced by the revenue growth described above and operational improvements in our msn business 
in fiscal  the growth in operating income reflected an increase of billion in revenue  partially offset by an increase of billion in operating expenses  primarily related to employee and related costs associated with additional headcount and increased legal settlement expenses  primarily the time warner settlement charge of million 
in fiscal  the growth in operating income reflected an increase of billion in revenue  substantially offset by an increase of billion in operating expenses  which included the onset of costs related to xbox video game systems 
we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  on july  and restated prior periods to reflect compensation cost under the recognition provisions of sfas for page 
table of contents part ii item all awards granted to employees after july  stock based compensation expenses are included in operating expenses as part of headcount related costs 
total stock based compensation costs included in operating expenses were billion in fiscal  billion in fiscal  and billion in fiscal in fiscal  we do not expect revenue to grow at similarly high rates as fiscal  even if information technology spending continues to improve 
while we expect general economic conditions to remain stable with the improvements seen in the second half of fiscal  we expect pc and server unit shipment growth rates to decline in fiscal from the high growth rates in fiscal we estimate pc shipments will grow from to and server unit shipments will grow from to in fiscal compared to fiscal these lower growth rates may cause slower revenue growth in fiscal we are anticipating little or no year over year foreign exchange rate benefit in fiscal we anticipate that we will renew between and of the expiring upgrade advantage program revenue through conversions to software assurance or migration to enterprise agreements 
total revenue expected to be recognized in our information worker  server and tools  and client businesses from previously deferred upgrade advantage revenue is million 
msn had a strong year in fiscal with revenue growth of driven by over growth in advertising revenue 
in fiscal  we expect msn to see growth in advertising revenue and subscription and transaction revenue from premium web services  partially offset by a reduction in access revenue as narrowband subscribers continue to decline 
accordingly  we do not expect the same level of revenue growth for msn in fiscal home and entertainment revenue grew moderately in fiscal we do not expect significant growth in home and entertainment in fiscal as price reductions in the second half of fiscal related to the late stage of the xbox lifecycle are expected to lead to lower revenue for the xbox business 
we expect our operating income growth in fiscal to exceed our revenue growth 
operating income is expected to reflect lower operating expenses due to the absence of certain legal settlements which occurred in fiscal  lower stock based compensation costs  and benefits achieved through continued progress in our previously announced cost efficacy initiative 
we expect that our segments in fiscal that reported a segment operating loss mobile and embedded devices  microsoft business solutions  and home and entertainment will make significant progress toward segment profitability in fiscal with improved operations

the growth of the client segment s revenue is largely correlated with the growth of purchases of pcs from oems that pre install versions of windows operating systems 
client revenue increase was driven by a growth in oem licenses and growth in oem revenue on increased consumer pc unit shipments in the first half of the fiscal year and growth in business pc unit shipments in the second half of fiscal revenue from commercial and retail licensing declined due to lower revenue earned from upgrade advantage licensing agreements and lower packaged product sales 
in fiscal  client revenue growth was driven by oem licensing revenue growth of million and a percentage point increase in the mix of the higher priced windows professional operating systems  the majority of which was in the oem channel 
windows professional revenue growth for fiscal was billion  or  compared to fiscal the windows professional growth in fiscal was partially offset by a million decline in revenue from earlier versions of windows operating systems 
client operating income was flat for fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased operating expenses primarily related to the charge for the sun microsystems settlement of million in the third quarter of fiscal and million of stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal  offset by growth in revenue 
operating income for fiscal increased primarily as a result of the growth in revenue  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses  largely attributed to headcount additions and related costs 
we estimate that pc market growth will be from to in fiscal we expect emerging markets to continue to outpace mature market growth rates and we expect to hold our share in these respective markets 
the differential market growth rate is expected to result in lower unit license growth in the oem business and lower revenue growth  as piracy continues to be problematic in emerging markets  and significant price changes are not anticipated 
we plan to continue our efforts to increase premium product mix but expect to see only modest improvements in fiscal the client commercial and retail licensing revenues are expected to continue to lag behind overall client revenue growth 
we expect operating profits as a percentage of client revenue to improve in fiscal  due to the legal settlements expenses and stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in fiscal major investments in fiscal include development of the windows client next generation operating system longhorn  security programs  and marketing initiatives  including those related to windows xp service pack and other new products

it also includes developer tools  training  certification  microsoft press  premier product support services  and microsoft consulting services 
growth in the overall market for information technology  both hardware and software  is the principal driver for server and tools revenue growth 
the segment concentrates on licensing products  applications  tools  content  and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient 
products are sold through oems  distributors  direct to customers  and through one time licenses or multi year volume license agreements 
we estimate that overall server hardware shipments grew in fiscal compared to the prior year 
server and server applications revenue  including cal revenue  grew billion or driven primarily by an estimated increase in windows based server shipments resulting in growth in new windows server licenses  and by favorable conversion of revenue billed in foreign currencies to us dollars 
consulting and premier product support services revenue increased million or compared to fiscal due to increased customer penetration from new product offerings 
revenue from developer tools  training  certification  and microsoft press and other services declined million or compared to fiscal due to recognition of revenue deferred in prior years

we anticipate that overall server hardware shipments will grow from to in fiscal and new licenses of windows server operating system will grow slightly faster than the overall market 
we believe that windows server shipments will create opportunities for sales of windows server system products 
however  we face strong competition from the linux based  unix  and other server operating systems 
in addition  server and tools net revenue for fiscal will be unfavorably affected by the absence of revenue earned from our upgrade advantage program and no anticipated foreign exchange benefit

most revenue from this segment comes from licensing our office system products 
revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as document lifecycle and collaboration 
revenue growth for fiscal from volume licensing  retail packaged product and pre installed versions of office in japan was in aggregate 
this increase was driven by recognition of unearned revenue primarily from a large increase in multi year licenses signed prior to the transition to our licensing programs and approximately million related to the launch of office oem licensing revenue grew or million 
foreign exchange rates provided approximately million or of total information worker revenue growth 
the billion or increase in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to growth in office suites revenue associated with new and anniversary multi year licensing agreements and a million or increase in revenue from the combined total of microsoft project  microsoft visio  and other stand alone applications 
information worker operating income in fiscal increased from the prior year primarily due to growth in revenue  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses  primarily related to million of stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal and higher sales and marketing expenses 
information worker operating profit for fiscal grew compared to fiscal  led by the increase in revenue and partially offset by a growth in operating expenses related to headcount additions and marketing expenses 
fiscal information worker revenue is expected to be similar to fiscal we are expecting a reduction in revenue earned from our upgrade advantage licensing agreements and no anticipated foreign exchange rate benefit 
the significant reduction in upgrade advantage earned revenue is expected to be offset by sustained momentum in our oem and multi year licensing offerings and increased purchasing of office system as enterprises complete their product evaluations

our revenue is generally derived from developing and marketing integrated  end to end business applications and services designed to help small and mid market businesses 
the small and mid market business applications market is highly fragmented and is intensely competitive in all sectors 
microsoft business solutions revenues are affected by the general economic environment and enterprise information technology spending in particular 
the revenue increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of navision and axapta erp products  and new sales of microsoft crm 
microsoft business solutions revenue for fiscal grew million from fiscal  of which million was attributable to the acquisition of navision at the beginning of the fiscal year 
the operating loss for fiscal declined from fiscal due to the increase in revenue and lower operating expenses including million of lower amortization costs  partially offset by million in stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal microsoft business solutions operating loss for fiscal increased from fiscal primarily due to operating losses associated with navision  increases in sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  and acquisition related costs 
we announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal a plan to align and include the small and mid market solutions partners sms p organization in the microsoft business solutions segment 
this change is designed to optimize our focus on delivering business applications to small and mid market segment businesses 
the sms p organization is currently part of the information worker segment 
this reorganization will result in a corresponding change to the microsoft business solutions and information worker reported results  primarily from the reorganization of approximately million in revenue and costs associated with our partner program offerings  which will move from information worker segment to microsoft business solutions

revenue is principally generated from advertisers on msn  from consumers through subscriptions and transactions generated from msn premium web services and from subscribers to msn narrowband internet access 
in fiscal  msn advertising revenue increased million or as a result of growth in paid search and growth in the overall internet advertising market 
this increase was partially offset by a decline of million or in internet access revenue  primarily from the migration of internet access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced internet service providers 
revenue from subscription and transaction services other than internet access increased million in fiscal to million

msn subscription revenue grew million or in fiscal reflecting an increase in the number of paying non promotion subscribers 
msn reached segment profitability in the first quarter of fiscal and was profitable for the full fiscal year 
the improvement in profitability was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from advertising in both display and paid search  a decline in customer acquisition costs and other expenses related to the internet access business  efficiency gains in the operations of the advertising and subscription businesses  and a million refund of prior year taxes  partially offset by million of stock based compensation expense related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal msn operating loss for fiscal decreased from fiscal  primarily as a result of the growth in revenue and lower relative subscription acquisition and support costs 
msn expects advertising revenue and revenue from subscriptions and transactions for premium web services to increase in fiscal advertising revenue should benefit from expected increases in internet spending and additions to the advertising platform including music download service  communication innovations  and an improved search engine 
we expect revenue from narrowband internet access to decline in fiscal as narrowband subscribers continue to migrate to broadband internet access 
we announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal an increase to the amount of storage we will provide for select msn and hotmail email accounts which will increase operating costs and may impact the revenues from our extra storage customers

the embedded operating system market is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings and relatively short product life cycles that affect our continuing revenue streams

we are a relatively new entrant in the video game console businesses with our first release in fiscal  and have established ourselves as one of the leaders 
revenue and unit volumes have grown quickly since  but revenue growth moderated in fiscal due to price reductions typical at this stage in the console lifecycle

operating loss in increased by million or from the prior year as the product costs associated with the increased xbox console sales and increased marketing expense more than offset the increase in revenue 
in fiscal  we expect xbox console unit volumes and revenue to decrease from fiscal consistent with this stage of the xbox console lifecycle  partially offset by increased unit volumes driven by the launch of software titles such as halo in fiscal we expect pc games revenue to decrease from fiscal driven by fewer new game titles

net realized gains on the sales of investments of billion included a billion gain on sale of our interest in expedia 
investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established

unearned revenue as of june  decreased million from june   reflecting recognition of unearned revenue from multi year licensing that has outpaced additions by million  primarily due to recognition from upgrade advantage licensing agreements and a million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements 
starting april  revenue deferred for undelivered elements reflected lower deferral rates  partially offset by lengthened product life cycles for the underlying products licensed  resulting in a higher proportion of revenue earned 
we earned approximately billion and billion from the upgrade advantage programs for fiscal and  respectively and expect to earn approximately million in fiscal from those programs 
cash flows cash flow from operations for fiscal decreased billion to billion 
the decrease primarily reflects the combined cash outflows of billion related to the sun microsystems settlement and the european commission fine mentioned above partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings 
cash used for financing was billion in fiscal  a decrease of billion from the prior year 
the decrease reflects that we did not repurchase any common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal combined with a million increase primarily from stock issuances related to employee stock options exercises  partially offset by an million increase in cash dividends paid 
we repurchased million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal cash used for investing was billion in fiscal  a decrease of billion from fiscal  due to a billion decrease in net investment purchases and a billion decrease in acquisition spending 
cash flow from operations was billion for fiscal  an increase of billion from fiscal the increase primarily reflects the rise in cash receipts from customers driven by the increase in revenue billings and maintenance of relatively stable accounts receivable levels 
cash used for financing was billion in fiscal  an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase reflects a cash dividend payment of million in and an increase of million in common stock repurchase  offsetting million received for common stock issued 
we repurchased million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal cash used for investing was billion in fiscal  a decrease of billion from fiscal  due to stronger portfolio performance on sold and matured investments 
cash flow from operations was billion for fiscal  an increase of billion from fiscal the increase reflected strong growth in unearned revenue as a result of the significant number of customers that purchased upgrade advantage during the licensing transition period 
this resulted in an increase in billings and a corresponding increase in the unearned revenue amount 
cash used for financing was billion in fiscal  a decrease of billion from the prior year 
the decrease reflected the repurchase of put warrants in the prior year

we will continue to invest in sales  marketing  product support infrastructure  and existing and advanced areas of technology 
additions to property and equipment will continue  including new facilities and computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  support  and administrative staff 
commitments for constructing new buildings were million on june  we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
we have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases 
these guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term  then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value 
as of june   the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately million 
we believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists 
we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources 
on july   our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of per share payable on september   to shareholders of record on august  in addition  the board approved a plan to buy back up to billion in microsoft common stock over the next four years 
the specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions  securities law limitations  and other factors 
the repurchases will be made using our cash resources 
the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
the board also approved a one time special dividend of per share  or approximately billion  subject to shareholder approval of stock plan amendments that will allow certain adjustments to employee equity compensation awards to offset the impact of the special dividend 
the special dividend will be payable on december   to shareholders of record on november   conditioned upon shareholder approval of amendments to the employee stock plans at the annual meeting of shareholders scheduled to be held november  we believe existing cash and short term investments  together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements and our special dividend as well as regular quarterly dividends

off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we have unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of jupiter telecommunication  ltd  a japanese cable company jupiter 
these guarantees arose on february  in conjunction with the expiration of prior financing arrangements  including previous guarantees by us 
the financing arrangements were entered into by jupiter as part of financing its operations 
as part of jupiter s new financing agreement  we agreed to guarantee repayment by jupiter of the loans of approximately million 
the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the guarantees was million and did not result in a charge to operations 
the guarantees are in effect until the earlier of either repayment of the loans  including accrued interest and fees  or february  the maximum amount of the guarantees is limited to the sum of the total due and unpaid principal amounts  accrued and unpaid interest  and any other related expenses 
additionally  the maximum amount of the guarantees  denominated in japanese yen  will vary based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
if we were required to make payments under the guarantees  we might recover all or a portion of those payments upon liquidation of jupiter s assets 
the proceeds from an asset liquidation cannot be accurately estimated due to the many factors that would affect the valuation and realization of the proceeds

application of critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  impairment of investment securities  impairment of goodwill  accounting for research and development costs  accounting for legal contingencies  and accounting for income taxes 
we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time 
these elements include free post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when and if available basis  the fair value of which is recognized over the product s estimated life cycle 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the financial health of and near term business outlook for the investee  including factors such as industry and sector performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
investments with an indicator are further evaluated to determine the likelihood of a significant adverse affect on the fair value and amount of the impairment as necessary 
in the past  we have had substantial impairments in our portfolio as discussed in note investment income loss 
if market  industry and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis july for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements  including sfas  accounting for research and development costs  and sfas  accounting for the costs of computer page 
table of contents part ii item software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material  and accordingly  we expense all research and development costs when incurred 
the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
issues and uncertainties this annual report on form k contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of issues and uncertainties such as those listed below and elsewhere in this report  which  among others  should be considered in evaluating our future financial performance 
challenges to our business model 
since our inception  our business model has been based upon customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and distributed by us 
under this commercial software model  software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development  offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution of their products 
we believe the commercial software model has had substantial benefits for users of software  allowing them to rely on our expertise and the expertise of other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop innovative software that is useful  reliable  and compatible with other software and hardware 
in recent years  there has been a growing challenge to the commercial software model 
under the non commercial software model  open source software produced by loosely associated groups of unpaid programmers and made available for license to end users without charge is distributed by firms at nominal cost that earn revenue on complementary services and products  without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software 
the most notable example of open source software is the linux operating system 
while we believe our products provide customers with significant advantages in security and productivity  and generally have a lower total cost of ownership than open source software  the popularization of the non commercial software model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model  including recent efforts by proponents of open source software to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products 
to the extent opens source software gains increasing market acceptance  sales of our products may decline  we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products  and revenue and operating margins may consequently decline 
intellectual property rights 
we defend our intellectual property rights  but unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights represents a loss of revenue to us 
while this adversely affects us revenue  the impact on revenue from outside the united states is more significant  particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights 
throughout the world  we actively educate consumers about the benefits of page 
table of contents part ii item licensing genuine products and educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected 
however  continued educational and enforcement efforts may not affect revenue positively  and revenue could be adversely affected by further deterioration in compliance with existing legal protections or reductions in the legal protection for intellectual property rights of software developers 
from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights 
the number of these claims may grow 
responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms  require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products  or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers 
if we are required to enter into such agreements or take such actions  our operating margins may decline as a result 
we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights  including via cross licenses of broad patent portfolios 
unauthorized disclosure of source code 
source code  the detailed program commands for our operating systems and software programs  is the most significant asset we own 
while we license certain portions of our source code for various software programs and operating systems to a number of licensees  we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code 
if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs  we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code 
the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality  which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins 
unauthorized disclosure of source code could also increase certain risks described below under security 
new products and services 
we have made significant investments in research  development and marketing for new products  services  and technologies  including longhorn  microsoft 
net  xbox  business applications  msn  and mobile and wireless technologies 
significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years  if at all 
moreover  these products and services may not be profitable  and even if they are profitable  operating margins for these businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 
litigation 
as discussed in note contingencies of the notes to financial statements  we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits 
adverse outcomes in some or all of the pending cases may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us 
we are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
while management currently believes that resolving all of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations  the litigation and other claims noted above are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future 
there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
security 
maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is an issue of critical importance for us and our customers 
there are malicious hackers who develop and deploy viruses  worms  and other malicious software programs that attack our products 
while this is an industry wide phenomenon that affects computers across all platforms  our customers in particular have been victims of such attacks and will likely continue to be so 
we are devoting significant resources to addressing these critical issues 
we are focusing our efforts on engineering more secure products  optimizing security and reliability options and settings when we deliver products  and providing guidance to help our customers make the best use of our products and services to protect against computer viruses and other attacks on their computing environment 
in addition  we are working to improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities discovered after our products are released 
we are also investing in mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when such software updates are not deployed 
we are also advising customers on how to help protect themselves from security threats through the use of our online automated security tools  our published security guidance  and the deployment of security software such as firewalls  antivirus  and other security software 
these steps could adversely affect our operating margins 
despite these efforts  actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products  to reduce or delay future purchases  or to purchase competitive products 
customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their computer systems from attack  which could delay adoption of new technologies 
any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue 
page 
table of contents part ii item declines in demand for software 
if overall market demand for pcs  servers  and other computing devices declines significantly  or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines  our revenue will be adversely affected 
additionally  our revenue would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products because new product offerings are not perceived as adding significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers 
a significant number of customers purchased license agreements providing upgrade rights to specific licensed products prior to the transition to licensing in july these agreements generally expired throughout fiscal and will largely be expired by the end of the first fiscal quarter in the rate at which such customers renew these contracts could adversely affect future revenue 
we are making significant investments in the next release of the windows operating system  code named longhorn 
if this system is not perceived as offering significant new functionality or value to prospective purchasers  our revenue and operating margins could be adversely affected 
product development schedule 
the development of software products is a complex and time consuming process 
new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods 
significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products  particularly any delays in the longhorn operating system  could adversely affect our revenue 
general economic and geo political risks 
softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue 
terrorist activity and armed conflict pose the additional risk of general economic disruption and could require changes in our operations and security arrangements  thus increasing our operating costs 
these conditions lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers 
competition 
we continue to experience intensive competition across all markets for our products and services 
these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes  price reductions  and or increased operating costs  such as for marketing and sales incentives  resulting in lower revenue  gross margins  and operating income 
taxation of extraterritorial income 
in august  a world trade organization wto dispute panel determined that the tax provisions of the fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of eti constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures 
the us government appealed the panel s decision and lost its appeal 
on march   the european union began imposing retaliatory tariffs on a specified list of us source goods 
in may  the us senate passed the jumpstart our business strength jobs act that would repeal eti  provide a three year phase out of current eti benefits  and would replace eti with a phased in domestic production activity deduction that would not be fully effective until the us house of representatives passed similar legislation in june that would repeal eti effective december   provide a two year phase out of eti benefits  and replace eti with a tax rate reduction for income from domestic production activities that would be full phased in by neither bill will fully replace our current eti tax benefits 
both bills must still be reconciled in conference  and significant changes could be made to the final legislation  so we remain unable to assess the ultimate form and financial impact of this legislation  if enacted 
if the eti provisions are repealed and financially comparable replacement tax legislation is not enacted  the loss of the eti tax benefit to us could be significant 
other potential tax liabilities 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
insurance programs 
in addition to conventional third party insurance arrangements  we have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose of protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered by traditional insurance markets 
as of june   the face value of captive insurance arrangements was page 
table of contents part ii item  a billion 
actual value at any particular time will vary due to deductibles  exclusions  other restrictions  and claims 
while we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against such risks  the potential liabilities associated with certain of the issues and uncertainties discussed in this document or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements 
business disruptions in the event of a catastrophic event 
we are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems in the event of a major earthquake  cyber attack  terrorist attack  or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales and providing services 
our corporate headquarters  a significant portion of our research and development activities  and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle  washington area  and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california  both of which are near major earthquake faults 
a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
other 
other issues and uncertainties may include warranty and other claims for hardware products such as xbox  sales channel disruption  such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor  the effects of the consent decree in us v 
microsoft and final judgment in state of new york v 
microsoft on the windows operating system and server business  including those associated with protocol and other disclosures required by the decree and final judgment and the ability of pc manufacturers to hide end user access to certain new windows features  currency fluctuations  our ability to implement operating cost structures that align with revenue growth  the continued availability of third party distribution channels for msn service and other online services  factors associated with our international operations  as described under operations in part i  item of this report  and financial market volatility or other changes affecting the value of our investments  such as the comcast corporation securities held by us that may result in a reduction in carrying value and recognition of losses including impairment charges 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and fixed income and equity price risks 
a portion of these risks is hedged  but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position 
we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  primarily with option contracts 
we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  japanese yen  british pound  and canadian dollar 
fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk 
the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk 
securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk  and are generally not hedged 
however  we use options to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes 
we use a value at risk var model to estimate and quantify our market risks 
var is the expected loss  for a given confidence level  in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value  but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model used for currencies and equities is geometric brownian motion  which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures 
for interest rate risk  the mean reverting geometric brownian motion is used to reflect the principle that fixed income securities prices revert to maturity value over time 
value at risk is calculated by  first  simulating  market price paths over days for equities  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  taking into account historical correlations among the different rates and prices 
each page 
table of contents part ii item a resulting unique set of equities prices  interest rates  and foreign exchange rates is then applied to substantially all individual holdings to re price each holding 
the th worst performance out of  represents the value at risk over days at the percentile confidence level 
several risk factors are not captured in the model  including liquidity risk  operational risk  credit risk  and legal risk 
certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes 
we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as put call collars 
in these arrangements  we hedge a security s equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security s appreciation above the sold call strike  in exchange for premium received for the sold call 
we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes 
we have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities in prior periods 
the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio 
losses in fair value over a day holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the day holding period used in the var analysis 
var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses  including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap 
the var numbers are shown separately for interest rate  currency  and equity risks 
these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges 
we use historical data to estimate var 
given the reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
the following table sets forth the var calculations for substantially all of our positions in millions year ended june  risk categories average high low interest rates currency rates equity prices the total var for the combined risk categories is million at june  and million at june  the total var is less at june  and less at june  than the sum of the separate risk categories for each of those years in the above table  due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks 
the change in the absolute value of var is primarily due to asset allocation shifts and portfolio growth
