the total number of locations at the end of was  up one from the end of executive summary many factors affect the company s net revenues and profitability  including economic and market conditions  the level and volatility of interest rates  inflation  political events  investor sentiment  legislative and regulatory developments  and competition 
because many of these factors are unpredictable and beyond the company s control  earnings may fluctuate significantly from year to year

the company generates revenues primarily through the revenues of its brokerage subsidiary  ag edwards sons  inc these revenues can be categorized into four main components transaction based revenues  asset management services  interest on margin accounts and management fees from investment banking transactions 
transaction based revenues are driven from the purchase or sale of securities by clients for their accounts 
the company earns commissions for acting as an agent for the client in the equity markets  as a dealer when the client purchases either fixed income or equity securities from inventory  or from selling concessions when the client purchases newly issued securities in investment banking transactions 
these revenues can be affected by trading volumes  by market and economic conditions  and by investor sentiment because the company s clients are primarily retail oriented 
revenues from asset management services are based principally on the amount of certain client assets purchased or held through the company 
these assets may be managed by the company or by third party investment managers  including mutual funds and money market funds 
interest revenue is derived primarily from financing clients margin transactions 
these revenues are based on the amount of client margin balances and the rate of interest charged on these balances 
investment banking management fees result from bringing new issues of securities  both equity based and fixed income based  to the market for issuers 
the issuers are generally corporate or municipal clients but may be institutional clients in the case of exchange traded funds and related products 
the fees generated from these transactions vary on the number and size of transactions successfully completed 
the company s expenses are primarily related to compensation and benefits 
the largest components are variable in nature and relate to commissions paid to the company s financial consultants related to transaction based or asset management services 
incentive compensation is largely based on the profitability of the company 
the company is focusing on making a larger portion of its expenses more variable in nature  particularly those expenses related to its back office systems 
in  the company experienced an increase in net revenues  net earnings and earnings per share versus the previous fiscal year and for each quarter during the year 
this compares with a decrease in net revenues and an increase in net earnings and earnings per share in compared to net revenues increased percent to billion in after declining percent to billion in in  the company s net revenues from equity based transactions increased million percent while net revenues from fixed income based transactions  primarily corporate and municipal debt  decreased million percent  reflecting an increased client interest in the rising equity markets and a shift away from fixed income products due to comparably lower yields 
net earnings increased percent million to million in after increasing percent million in diluted earnings per share for the company were in versus in and in the company s profit margin was percent in  percent in and percent in the results for included restructuring and other charges of million  which decreased net earnings million 
the following table illustrates the composition of the company s net revenues for  and commissions asset management and service fees principal transactions investment banking net interest as discussed further below  net revenues  net earnings and earnings per share may be affected by changes in interest rates 
net interest revenue and certain components of asset management and service fees are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates 
asset management and service fees were reduced during part of the year as a result of expense caps on certain third party money funds offered by the company being triggered by low money fund yields 
in the third quarter of  the investors in the money market funds voted to lift these expense caps 
in addition to continued competition from firms traditionally engaged in the financial services business  there has been increased competition in recent years from other sources  such as commercial banks  insurance companies  online service providers  mutual fund sponsors and other companies offering financial services both in the united states and globally for a similar client base  including the client base served by the company 
results of operations the following table and discussion summarize the changes in major categories of revenues and expenses for the past two fiscal years dollars in thousands increase decrease vs vs revenues commissions asset management and service fees principal transactions investment banking interest other total revenues interest expense net revenues non interest expenses compensation and benefits communication and technology occupancy and equipment marketing and business development floor brokerage and clearance other restructuring total non interest expenses commissions commission revenues arise from activities in transaction based accounts in listed and over the counter securities  mutual funds  futures  options  and insurance products 
as commissions are transaction based revenues  they are influenced by the number  size and market value of client transactions and by product mix 
the return of the retail investor to the equity markets produced positive results for the company as commission revenues increased million percent from million in to  million in commissions from listed transactions increased million percent  and over the counter transactions increased million percent 
commissions from mutual fund transactions  primarily equity based mutual funds  increased million percent 
please refer to mutual fund regulatory matters below 
revenues from commodities  financial futures and insurance products increased a combined million percent as investors also increased their interest in these investment products 
the million percent decrease in commission revenues in resulted primarily from reduced investor participation in the equity markets given the difficult market conditions during that period 
in addition  the company s clients continued to shift their assets to fee based accounts and fixed income securities 
commissions from over the counter transactions decreased million percent  listed transactions decreased million percent and mutual funds decreased million percent 
asset management and service fees asset management and service fees include fees based on the value of client assets under management and transaction related service fees as well as fees related to the administration of custodial and other specialty accounts 
these revenues consist primarily of revenues earned from providing support and services in connection with client assets under third party management  including mutual funds and annuities  as well as the company s trust services and fee based trading accounts 
please refer to mutual fund regulatory matters below 
asset management and service fee revenues increased million percent in fees received in connection with client assets under third party management and the company s trust services and fee based trading accounts increased million percent  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of accounts choosing fee based alternatives and the increased valuation of these accounts 
fees received from third party mutual funds and insurance providers increased million percent reflecting the individual investors return to the equity markets 
service fees increased million percent due to revenue growth from a variety of products and services 
these gains were offset by a million percent decrease in fees received from third party investment managers in connection with the distribution of certain third party money market funds offered by the company 
these money market funds had reached expense caps due to low money fund yields 
in november  the investors in these money market funds voted to lift these expense caps 
as a result  these fees increased million percent in the fourth quarter over the third quarter 
if current conditions continue  the company expects these fees to continue at fourth quarter levels 
in  asset management and service fees decreased million percent from as a result of a decrease of million percent in the distribution fees received from third party investment managers in connection with the above mentioned money market funds partially offset by an increase in other fees 
principal transactions the company maintains inventories of fixed income and equity securities to satisfy client demand and  therefore  effects certain transactions with its clients by acting as a principal 
realized and unrealized gains and losses result from the sale and holding of securities positions for resale to clients and are included in principal transaction revenue

revenue from the sale of municipal and corporate fixed income securities decreased million percent while revenue from the sale of corporate equity securities increased million percent 
in  principal transaction revenue decreased million percent from revenue from the sale of equity securities and corporate debt decreased million percent and million percent  respectively  while revenues from the sale of municipal and government securities increased million percent and million percent  respectively 
corporate accounting scandals and market volatility related to concerns about the economy and the possibility of war led investors to the higher after tax yields of municipal securities and increased safety of treasury products

the company also provides advisory services to corporate and governmental entities 
revenues from investment banking activities increased million percent in underwriting fees and selling concessions from corporate equity transactions increased million percent and management fees increased million percent  while revenues derived from debt products decreased million percent 
these changes largely reflect continued strength in the underwriting of a variety of closed end funds  significant growth in follow on equity underwritings and reduced demand for lower yielding debt products 
in  investment banking revenues declined million percent 
underwriting fees and selling concessions from corporate products decreased million percent  reflecting investors desire for higher yields and greater safety 
underwriting fees and selling concessions from municipal and government products increased a combined million percent as clients sought the relative safety and higher yields of these products 
net interest revenue interest revenue net of interest expense decreased million percent during and decreased million percent in these declines were due to declines in average client margin balances and in average interest rates 
in january  the company changed the base rate upon which margin interest is calculated from the broker call rate to the prime rate 
as a result  the company expects net interest revenue to increase in future periods 
actual results will vary based upon the level of margin balances  future changes in interest rates and the company s financing needs 
non interest expenses compensation and benefits increased million percent in a significant portion of this expense is variable in nature and relates to commissionable sales sales upon which payments are made to financial consultants and to the company s profitability

administrative salaries and other fixed components decreased million percent in as a result of fewer employees and lower medical costs 
in  compensation and benefits decreased million percent

administrative salaries and other fixed components declined million percent following the workforce reductions implemented at the end of as part of the million decrease  the cost of medical benefits declined million percent  primarily as a result of changes in plan design 
the implementation of three performance based compensation structures  one for research analysts  one for investment bankers and one for institutional sales traders  offset part of the reduction in incentive compensation in communication and technology expenses decreased million percent in and decreased million percent in the decreases in expenses in both years were principally related to lower costs associated with financial consultants workstations

the task force recommended significant changes to the procedures used to gather information from clients and to share information with mutual funds to better enable broker dealers to deliver breakpoint discounts 
the sec  the nasd and other regulators  as well as congress  are examining the manner in which mutual funds compensate broker dealers for the sale of their shares 
edwards has provided information in connection with certain related examinations

the company is not able to predict whether industry wide changes will occur or the possible impacts  if any  should changes be adopted 
edwards has received information requests from the sec and the nasd with respect to mutual fund transactions that may involve market timing  late trading or both  and the sec  the nasd and certain states have examined certain of edwards branch offices in connection with mutual fund transactions

the sec has asked edwards  like other firms that use the national securities clearing corporation s fund serv system  to submit and clear mutual fund orders  to review systems and controls for mutual fund orders to prevent late trading  and to review all mutual fund orders for a year to determine whether late trading in mutual funds occurred

critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  management makes use of certain estimates and assumptions 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following critical policies  estimates and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and are the most susceptible to significant fluctuations in the near term 
valuation of investments the fair value of investments  for which a quoted market or dealer price is not available  is based on management s estimate 
among the factors considered by management in determining the fair value of investments are cost  terms and liquidity of the investment  the sale price of recently issued securities  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  earnings trends and consistency of operating cash flows  the long term business potential of the issuer  the quoted market price of securities with similar quality and yields that are publicly traded  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
valuation of stock options the company applies the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and related interpretations to account for options granted under its two employee stock plans  the employee stock purchase plan and the incentive stock plans 
based on the provisions of the plans  no compensation expense has been recognized for options issued under these plans 
the fair value of the stock options is estimated using expected dividend yields of the company s stock  the expected volatility of the stock  the expected length of time the options remain outstanding  risk free interest rates and expected forfeiture rates 
changes in one or more of these factors may significantly affect the estimated fair value of the stock options 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board recently issued for comment a proposal that would mandate expensing the grant date fair value of the stock options issued under the company s employee stock compensation plans 
as a result  the company is evaluating the impact of the proposed standard and possible changes in its employee benefit plans  including the possibility of changing or eliminating its employee stock purchase plan to minimize the impact in future periods 
software development costs the company applies the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use to account for costs associated with internally developed software 
the company capitalizes the costs associated with software development based on guidance provided in the statement 
the primary factors considered in determining the amount to capitalize include the stage of the development effort and the type of work being performed 
only costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized 
when placed in service  these costs are typically amortized over three to five years and are included in communication and technology expense on the company s consolidated statements of earnings 
allowance for doubtful accounts from customers receivables from customers consist primarily of floating rate loans collateralized by margin securities 
management estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potential losses from unsecured and partially unsecured customer accounts deemed uncollectible 
the facts and circumstances surrounding each receivable and the number of shares  price and volatility of the underlying collateral are considered by management in determining the allowance 
management continually evaluates its receivables from customers for collectibility and possible write off 
the company manages the credit risk associated with its receivables from customers through credit limits and continuous monitoring of collateral 
legal reserves the company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits  in some of which plaintiffs claim substantial amounts  relating primarily to its securities and commodities business 
management has determined that it is likely that ultimate resolution in favor of the plaintiffs will result in losses to the company on certain of these claims and as a result  establishes accruals for potential litigation losses 
factors considered by management in estimating the company s accrual for litigation liability are the loss and damages sought by the plaintiffs  the merits of the claims  the total cost of defending the litigation  the likelihood of a successful defense against the claims  and the potential for fines and penalties from regulatory agencies 
management  based on its understanding of the facts  reasonably estimates a range of loss and accrues what it considers appropriate to reserve against probable loss for certain claims 
the company also is involved  from time to time  in investigations and proceedings by governmental and self regulatory agencies  certain of which may result in adverse judgments  fines or penalties 
while results of litigation and investigations and proceedings by governmental and self regulatory agencies or the results of judgments  fines or penalties cannot be predicted with certainty  management  after consultation with counsel  believes that resolution of all such matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated balance sheets  statements of earnings or statements of cash flows of the company 
income tax accruals the company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions  and as a result  accruals for tax contingencies require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate tax liability in any given year 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years

the company calculated the potential loss in fair value of its debt inventory by calculating the change in the offering price of each inventory item resulting from a percent increase in either the treasury yield curve for taxable products or the municipal market data corporation s aaa rated yield curve for tax exempt products
