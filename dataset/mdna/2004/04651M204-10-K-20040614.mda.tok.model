table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business and operating segments we are a leading global publisher and developer of video game software for both gaming enthusiasts and the mass market audience 
development  publishing and distribution of video game software are our major activities 
development activities include development of games by both internal and external development studios 
internal studios are studios owned by us for the sole purpose of game development and external development studios are independent studios with which we or iesa and its subsidiaries have contracts for the development of specific titles 
our publishing activities include overseeing development  sales  marketing and packaging of video game software 
distribution activities primarily include the sale of games produced by other publishers 
the distribution channels for interactive software have expanded significantly in recent years 
consumers have access to interactive software through a variety of outlets  including mass merchant retailers such as wal mart and target  major retailers  such as best buy  compusa  and toys r us  and specialty stores such as electronics boutique and gamestop 
additionally  our games are made available through various internet and on line networks 
our sales to key customers wal mart  best buy  target and gamestop accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of net revenues for the year ended march  key challenges the video game software industry has experienced an increased rate of change and complexity in the technological innovations of video game hardware and software 
in addition to these technological innovations  there has been greater competition for shelf space and creative talent as well as increased buyer selectivity 
as a result  the video game industry has become increasingly hit driven  which has led to higher per game production budgets  longer and more complex development processes  and generally shorter product life cycles 
the importance of the timely release of hit titles  as well as the increased scope and complexity of the product development process  have increased the need for disciplined product development processes that limit cost and overruns 
this  in turn  has increased the importance of leveraging the technologies  characters or storylines of existing hit titles into additional video game software franchises in order to spread development costs among multiple products 
in this environment  we are determined to achieve balances between internal and external development  and licensed and proprietary products 
key developments atari name in may  we changed our name to atari  inc and changed our trading symbol on the nasdaq national market to atar 
we obtained rights to use the atari name through a license from iesa  which iesa acquired as a part of the acquisition of hasbro interactive 
we believe that the atari brand  which is largely credited with launching the video game industry  continues to carry a level of respect  recognition and legacy for innovation that will enhance our reputation and improve consumer recognition of our products 
as of may  all of our products are published  distributed and marketed under the atari brand 
recapitalization and offering during the second quarter of the year ended march   we completed a recapitalization through the issuance of new shares pursuant to an agreement with our majority stockholder  iesa  and a public offering 
per the agreement with iesa  on september   we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  valued at per share  to iesa and its wholly owned subsidiary cush  in satisfaction of approximately million of our net indebtedness to iesa 
on september   iesa sold  of such shares at per share in a public offering 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale by iesa of our common stock 
we also sold  new shares of our common stock in a public offering at per share  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
after these transactions  on october   the underwriters exercised their over allotment option  purchasing  shares at a purchase price of per share 
the option shares were purchased from iesa  reducing iesa s direct and indirect ownership to approximately of our common stock directly and through its wholly owned subsidiaries cush and atari interactive 
we did not receive any of the proceeds from the exercise of the over allotment option 
atari license in connection with the recapitalization agreement  atari interactive extended the term of the license under which we use the atari name for ten years expiring on december  we issued  shares of our common stock to atari interactive for the extended license and will pay a royalty equal to of our net revenues during years six through ten of the extended license 

table of contents year end changes effective march   we changed our fiscal year end from june to march accordingly  the discussion of financial results set forth below compares the twelve months ended march  to the twelve months ended march  unaudited  the nine months ended march  to the nine months ended march  unaudited  and the year ended june  to the year ended june  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts and notes receivable  inventories  intangible assets  investments  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
sales returns  price protection  other customer related allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts sales are recorded net of estimated future returns  price protection and other customer related allowances 
we are not contractually obligated to accept returns  however  based on facts and circumstances at the time a customer may request approval for a return  we may permit the return or exchange of products sold to certain customers 
in addition  we may provide price protection  co operative advertising and other allowances to certain customers in accordance with industry practice 
these reserves are determined based on historical experience  market acceptance of products produced  budgeted customer allowances and existing commitments to customers 
although management believes it provides adequate reserves with respect to these items  actual activity could vary from management s estimates and such variances could have a material impact on reported results 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
for the year ended june   the nine months ended march  unaudited and  and the years ended march  unaudited and  we recorded allowances for bad debts  returns  price protection and other customer promotional programs of approximately million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
as of march  and march   the aggregate reserves against accounts receivable for bad debts  returns  price protection and other customer promotional programs were approximately million and million  respectively 
inventories we write down our inventories for estimated slow moving or obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and estimated market value based upon assumed market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those assumed by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
for the year ended june   the nine months ended march  unaudited and  and the years ended march  unaudited and  we recorded obsolescence expense of approximately million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
as of march  and march   the aggregate reserve against inventories was approximately million and million  respectively 
external developer royalty advances and milestone payments rapid technological innovation  shelf space competition  shorter product life cycles and buyer selectivity have made it extremely difficult to determine the likelihood of individual product acceptance and success 
as a result  we follow the policy of expensing external developer royalty advances also known as developer advances as incurred  treating such costs as research and development expenses 
generally  developers are paid an advance upon the signing of a contract with us 
subsequent payments are due as the specific contractual milestones are met by the developer and approved by us 
the timing of when these contracts are entered into and when milestone payments are made could vary significantly from budgeted amounts and  because these payments are expensed as incurred  they could have a material impact on reported results in a given period 

table of contents income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction  a valuation allowance is established 
the estimated effective tax rate is adjusted for the tax related to significant unusual items 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate 
as of march   we have combined net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes 
these loss carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income  if any  and will expire beginning in the years through in addition  the amount and expiration of net operation loss carryforwards may differ for state tax purposes 
we experienced an ownership change in as a result of the acquisition by iesa 
under section of the internal revenue code  when there is an ownership change  the pre ownership change loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation which could reduce or defer the utilization of these losses 
pre acquisition losses of approximately million are subject to an annual limitation approximately million 
a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the net deferred tax asset based on our historical operating results and the conclusion that such asset may not be realized 
management reassesses its position with regard to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
related party transactions we are involved in numerous related party transactions with iesa and its subsidiaries 
these related party transactions include  but are not limited to  the purchase and sale of product  game development  management and support services and distribution agreements

the benefit of a sales mix shift out of the higher cost distribution business and into the lower cost publishing business is largely being offset by a continuing sales mix shift within the publishing business toward the more costly console product and away from the less costly pc product  which is consistent with current industry trends 
approximately of the publishing business shipments consisted of console sales during the year ended march  versus in the comparable period 
for the year ended march   the distribution business accounted for of our net revenues as compared to for the comparable period

furthermore  interest expense has been further reduced by interest income received from advances to related parties of approximately million earned through the date of the recapitalization agreement

our outstanding accounts receivable balance varies significantly on a quarterly basis due to the seasonality of our business and the timing of new product releases 
there were no significant changes in the credit terms with customers during the twelve month period

iesa has incurred significant losses from operations and is highly leveraged 
should iesa experience liquidity issues  among other things  this may result in its inability to fund the development efforts of atari interactive  and our results of operations may suffer because  as the north american distributor of the games developed by atari interactive  our revenue could significantly decrease 
such a reduction of our revenue  among other things  could result in a breach of one or more of the covenants contained in our gecc senior credit facility 
in the event any of the above contingencies occur  management is prepared to take various actions which may include  but not be limited to  a reduction in our expenditures for internal and external new product development and a reduction in overhead expenses 
these actions  should they become necessary  may result in a significant reduction in the size of our operations
