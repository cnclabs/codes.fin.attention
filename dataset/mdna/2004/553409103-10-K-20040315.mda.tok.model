the company believes presenting certain results on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it allows a more meaningful comparison of the performance of its foreign operations from period to period 
additionally  certain internal reporting and compensation targets are based on constant currency financial data for the company s various foreign subsidiaries

these requirements have been met through a combination of bank debt and internally generated funds

critical accounting policies the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
associated with this  the company believes the following are its most critical accounting policies in that they are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition the company recognizes substantially all revenue at the time services are provided and is recorded on a time and materials basis 
in most cases  the consultant is the company s employee and all costs of employing the worker are the responsibility of the company and are included in cost of revenue 
revenues generated when the company permanently places an individual with a client are recorded at the time of placement less a reserve for employees not expected to meet the probationary period 
in addition and to a lesser extent  the company is involved in fixed price or lump sum engagements 
the services rendered by the company under the relevant contracts generally require performance spanning more than one accounting period 
the company recognizes revenue for these engagements under the proportional performance accounting model 
goodwill in connection with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to perform goodwill impairment reviews  at least annually  utilizing a fair value approach 
additionally  sfas no 
required a transitional goodwill impairment review upon adoption 
the company adopted sfas no 
as of january  in connection  the company engaged an independent valuation consultant to assist with the required transitional goodwill impairment review 
as of december   the company s consolidated balance sheet reflected goodwill of  million 
after performing the required transitional goodwill impairment tests  the company recognized a loss of million  net of an income tax benefit of million  and recorded the loss net of the related tax benefit as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the company performed additional valuation testing during the fourth quarter of and the company s designated timing of the annual impairment test under sfas no 
and did not incur any further impairment 
the company plans to perform its next annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of an impairment review prior to the company s next scheduled annual review may be required if certain events occur  including lower than forecasted earnings levels for various reporting units 
in addition  changes to other assumptions could significantly impact our estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 
such a change may result in a goodwill impairment charge  which could have a significant impact on the reportable segments that include the related reporting units and the company s consolidated financial statements 
as part of the company s goodwill impairment reviews  fair value was calculated using an equally blended value of a discounted cash flow analysis and market comparables 
in contrast to sfas  the prior accounting standard sfas no 
required the use of undiscounted cash flow estimates over the remaining useful life of the goodwill and other long lived assets as a step test for possible impairment 
under sfas no 
 the concept of recoverability of the goodwill over the useful life of the asset was the underlying test for impairment as opposed to fair value under sfas no 
this fundamental difference in the underlying methodologies of testing for impairment of goodwill in sfas no 
and sfas no 
caused the company to attribute the resulting impairment from the initial valuation completed on january  to a change in accounting principle upon the adoption of sfas no 
projected cash flows  used for both sfas no 
and no 
testing  considered the effects from the then downturn in the company s business 
as mentioned above  the company used an equally blended value of a discounted cash flow analysis and market comparables to arrive at fair value for sfas no 
for the discounted cash flow analysis  significant assumptions included expected future revenue growth rates  reporting unit profit margins  working capital levels and a discount rate 
the revenue growth rates and reporting unit profit margins are based  in part  on the company s expectation of an improving economic environment 
market comparables included a comparison of the market ratios and performance fundamentals from comparable companies 
the use of these measurement criteria is consistent with the underlying concepts used in determining the fair value of a company or reportable unit under the market approach 
the market ratios the company used refer to the multiples of revenue and earnings of comparable companies and the performance fundamentals refer to the consideration of the effects of the differences in the operating metrics  ie 
growth rates  operating margins  gross margins  etc 
on the value of the company versus the comparable companies 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by its customers 
this evaluation is based upon a variety of factors including an analysis of amounts current and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer 
based upon the results of this analysis  the company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts for this risk 
this analysis requires the company to make significant estimates  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income before taxes as reported in the company s consolidated statements of income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
an assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets 
this assessment includes anticipating future income 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the company s net deferred tax assets 
management evaluates all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the establishment and amount of a valuation allowance requires significant estimates and judgment and can materially affect the company s results of operations 
the company s effective tax rate may vary from period to period based  for example  on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of acquisitions 
the company has a net deferred tax asset as of both december  and  primarily due to the impairment loss recorded as a change in accounting principle associated with the company s adoption of sfas no 
in this impairment reduced the financial statement carrying amount of goodwill  which resulted in the tax basis of tax deductible goodwill being greater than the financial statement carrying amount 
the company s tax basis in its tax deductible goodwill will be deducted in the company s income tax returns  generating million of future tax deductions over the next years 
mps is subject to periodic review by federal  state  foreign and local taxing authorities in the ordinary course of business 
during  mps was notified by the internal revenue service that certain prior year income tax returns would be examined 
as part of this examination  the net tax benefit associated with an investment in a subsidiary that mps recognized in of million is also being reviewed 
in  the company recorded an million charge for an agreed upon adjustment related to its audit of prior years tax returns

exit costs in and  the company experienced a material decrease in demand for its domestic operations 
to reflect this decreased demand  the company made attempts to realign its real estate capacity needs and thus vacate and reorganize certain office space 
in  management determined that the company would not be able to utilize this vacated office space 
this determination eliminated the economic benefit associated with the vacated office space 
as a result  the company recorded million of contract termination costs in  mainly due to  costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the company 
these termination costs were recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized  at fair value  when the liability is incurred rather than at the time an entity commits to a plan 
in  the company recaptured  of these costs relating to the settlement of the abandoned space 
while the company looks to settle excess lease obligations  the current economic environment has made it difficult for the company to either settle or find acceptable subleasing opportunities 
the average remaining lease term for the lease obligations included herein is approximately years 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
for the company s discontinued manchester operations  the company recorded million of contract termination costs in as a result of the sale of manchester  the company recorded an additional million of contract termination costs in  which is included in loss on disposition  net of tax on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
impairment on tangible assets the company reviews its long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and identifiable intangibles would be based on the fair value of the asset

the company generated approximately of its consolidated revenues for from international operations  approximately of which were from the united kingdom 
the british pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate has increased approximately in  from at december  to at december  the company prepared sensitivity analyses to determine the adverse impact of hypothetical changes in the british pound sterling  relative to the us dollar  on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels resulting from a change in the british pound sterling 
an additional adverse movement in the exchange rate would have had an immaterial impact on the company s cash flows and financial position for while fluctuations in the british pound sterling have not historically had a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  the lower level of earnings resulting from a decrease in demand for the services provided by the company s domestic operations have increased the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
as of december   the company did not hold and has not previously entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments 
factors which may impact future results and financial condition demand for the company s services is impacted by the economic climate in the industries and markets the company serves 
this economic climate is difficult to predict  with downturns weakening demand 
mps s revenues are affected by the level of business activity of its customers  which is driven by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets we serve 
while we have experienced a recent uptick in demand related to the current economic environment  a downturn or deterioration in global economic or political conditions could significantly hurt our revenues and results of operations 
we cannot predict when the economic climate will significantly improve 
although we are seeing an slight improvement in the economic climate  we cannot predict to what extent the demand for our services will improve 
even though we have a somewhat variable cost base  further declines in revenue will have a material adverse impact on our results 
the current economic climate may also encourage customer downsizings  or consolidations through mergers and otherwise of our major customers or between our major customers with non customers 
these may result in redundant functions or services and a resulting reduction in demand by those customers for our services 
also  spending for outsourced business services may be put on hold until the consolidations are completed 
economic considerations may also encourage our customers to consolidate their vendor lists in an attempt to achieve cost and expense savings  which increases competitive pressure as described below 
our market is highly competitive  which puts pressure on the profit margins of our services 
our industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented  with few barriers to entry by potential competitors 
mps faces significant competition in the industries and markets it serves  and will face significant competition in any geographic market that it may enter 
in each market in which we operate  we compete for both clients and qualified candidates with other firms offering similar services 
competition creates an aggressive pricing environment  which puts pressure on profit margins 
we have increasingly competed against service providers offering their services from remote locations  particularly from offshore locations such as india 
the substantially lower cost of the labor pool in these remote locations puts significant pricing pressure on our service offerings when we compete with them 
while we believe that our service delivery model provides a superior level of service than many of these offshore based competitors  the increased pricing pressure from these providers may have a material adverse impact on our profitability 
the effects of competition may be intensified by our customers consolidation of their vendor lists 
as customers have consolidated their number of vendors  often in an attempt to secure cost or expense savings in the face of difficult economic conditions  competition to be an approved vendor has greatly intensified 
if we fail to remain on these consolidated vendor lists  our results of operations will suffer accordingly 
competing to remain on  or get on  these vendor lists could obligate us to offer our services at prices that offer lower margins  and less profit  than we might otherwise be able to achieve 
our business depends on key personnel  including executive officers  local managers and field personnel  our failure to retain existing key personnel or attract new people will reduce business and revenues 
mps s operations depend on the continued efforts of our officers and executive management 
the loss of key officers and members of executive management may cause a significant disruption to our business 
we also depend on the performance and productivity of our local managers and field personnel 
our ability to attract and retain new business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered 
the loss of key managers and field personnel may also jeopardize existing client relationships with businesses that continue to use our services based upon past relationships with local managers and field personnel 
our revenues would decline in that event 
the inability to comply with existing government regulation along with increased regulation of the workplace could adversely effect the company 
the company s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries 
while the company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material 
any inability of the company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely effect the company 
additionally  the company s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients workplaces 
increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer employee relationship could materially adversely effect the company 
the company is exposed to employment related claims and costs and other litigation that could materially adversely effect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients workplaces 
the company s ability to control the workplace environment is limited 
as the employer of record of its temporary employees  the company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events  including claims of physical injury  discrimination  harassment  or retroactive entitlement to employee benefits 
the company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors  omissions  misappropriation  or theft of property or information by its temporary employees 
the company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims 
while such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect on the company  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the company or that such claims whether by reason of the company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the company s insurance will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 
adjustments during periodic tax audits may increase our tax liability and hurt our results of operations 
mps is subject to periodic review by federal  foreign  state  and local taxing authorities in the ordinary course of business 
during  mps was notified by the internal revenue service that certain prior year income tax returns will be examined 
as part of this examination  the net tax benefit associated with an investment in a subsidiary that mps recognized in of million is also being reviewed 
in  the company recorded an million charge for an agreed upon adjustment related to its audit of prior years tax returns 
while mps has not received notice of any additional adjustments relating to its audit of prior years tax returns  we cannot assure you that the irs will not propose additional adjustments 
additional adjustments may affect our financial condition 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may result in losses for investors 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
for example  during the period from january  until december   the closing price of the common stock as reported on the new york stock exchange ranged from a high of to a low of 
our stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including factors listed above and others  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  announcement of new services by us or our competitors  announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions  changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts  valuation fluctuations which may cause a negative impact to our operating results as it relates to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 and changes in general economic conditions 
because of this volatility  we may fail to meet the expectations of our shareholders or of securities analysts  and our stock price could decline as a result
