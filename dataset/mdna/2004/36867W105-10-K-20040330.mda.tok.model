item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the historical information  the discussion in this annual report contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to the factors set forth under factors affecting future operating results below and elsewhere in this annual report common terms hap technology the key components of our hap technology are a database of highly informative  proprietary measures of genomic variation  or haplotypes  which we call hap markers  for pharmaceutically relevant genes  a proprietary informatics system  which we call decogen  including unique algorithms  for defining patient populations with different drug responses  a cost effective  efficient process for measuring genomic variation in clinical dna samples  which we call hap typing  glp compliant dna banking and genotyping services and clinical genetics development skills 
strength program statin response examined by genetic hap markers this program was designed to apply our hap technology and our clinical genetics development skills to the statin class of drugs  which doctors use to treat patients with high cholesterol and lipid levels and who are  therefore  at risk for cardiovascular disease 
caring program clozapine and agranulocytosis relationships investigated by genetics hap markers this program was designed to identify which of our hap markers define the patients who are most likely to develop agranulocytosis  a potentially life threatening depletion of white blood cells  if treated with clozapine 
cardiac channelopathies program this program was designed to develop a clia compliant genetic test for detecting cardiac ion channel mutations 
cardiac channelopathies  including familial long qt lqt and brugada syndromes  are conditions that affect the electrical system of the heart 
these conditions are caused by genetic mutations that result in structural abnormalities in the potassium and sodium channels of the heart and predispose affected individuals to an abnormal heart rhythm arrhythmia 
familial lqt and brugada syndromes are commonly seen in apparently healthy  active adolescent patients 
if left undiagnosed and untreated  these conditions can be fatal 
this dna based test utilizes intellectual property that we acquired when we purchased substantially all of the assets of dna sciences  inc in may we will also seek to discover genetic markers that are predictive of qt prolongation and arrhythmias  which are drug induced and occur in patients with other disorders  such as congestive heart failure 
overview we are a leader in the discovery and use of human gene variation for the development of a new generation of dna based diagnostic and therapeutic products 
our technology  services and clinical development expertise are marketed to pharmaceutical  biotechnology and diagnostic companies  as a comprehensive solution to their pharmacogenomic needs 
our goal is to improve drug development  drug therapy prescribed by physicians and the quality of a patient s life by elucidating the role of genetic variation in drug response 
additionally  we provide dna banking and research  and genotyping and related services  to a variety of companies in accordance with good laboratory practices 
since our inception  we have incurred significant operating losses  and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the majority of our operating losses have resulted from costs we incurred developing our hap technology  in our clinical trials and administrative costs associated with operations 
as part of our hap technology platform  we continue to populate our database with hap marker information for pharmaceutically relevant genes 
as of december   we had a total of  genes in our database with  of these genes having been added during the year ended december   and  genes having been added during the year ended december  there is not necessarily any correlation between the costs incurred in any period and the number of genes added to the database in that period 
this is due to the fact that the size of the gene and  therefore  the amount of work involved varies from gene to gene 
in addition  after a gene is sequenced it must be analyzed and go through an internal quality assurance check before it is added to the database 
this process may cause a gene sequenced in one period to be added to the database in a different period 
furthermore  since additional information about genes continues to be discovered  we may resequence genes previously included in the database and do further quality assurance analysis 
we expect to dedicate a significant portion of our resources for the foreseeable future to servicing our hap technology customers and strength program customers  our pharmacogenomics support services customers  our caring program  to develop our lqt genetic program and to maintain our hap technology 
to date  our revenue has been primarily from licensing and service fees from our agreements with astrazeneca uk limited  biogen idec  inc  gene logic  inc  johnson johnson pharmaceutical research development j j prd  millennium pharmaceuticals  inc and pfizer  inc  as well as a sublicensing agreement with visible genetics  inc and  to a lesser extent  government grants 
acquisitions lark technologies  inc on december   we entered in to an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with lark technologies  inc lark under which we plan to acquire lark in a stock for stock exchange 
each lark shareholder would receive shares of our common stock for each share held of lark 
if the merger had occurred on december   the former lark shareholders would have held approximately of total outstanding shares of genaissance on a fully diluted basis 
a joint proxy prospectus has been declared effective by the sec and the shareholder meetings to vote on the merger are scheduled to take place on april  we expect to close this transaction early in the second quarter of lark provides contract molecular biology services to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agbio industries at its facilities in houston and the uk 
lark s contract research service portfolio consists of over a hundred different molecular biology services in the areas of nucleic acid extraction services  dna sequencing services  genetic stability testing services  gene expression and detection services  and custom molecular biology services 
we will record the transaction as a purchase for accounting purposes and allocate the purchase price of approximately million to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
we will allocate the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of the net tangible assets acquired to identified intangibles with estimated useful lives as follows backlog year  customer relationships years  and glp certification and trade name indefinite 
we currently estimate the resulting goodwill will be approximately million however  the ultimate amount will be dependent upon the closing balance sheet of lark 
based on our initial estimates of acquired intangibles  we would expect to incur charges for amortization of intangibles of approximately  in the first twelve months post closing and approximately  per year thereafter 
our consolidated financial statements will include the results of operations and cash flows of lark from the closing date 
we expect that although lark will contribute positive operating results  we will still incur net losses in the foreseeable future 
the extent of the benefits received from the acquisition will depend upon how quickly we are able to integrate lark s operations with our operations including sales forces and operational efficiencies 
dna sciences  inc on may   under order of the united states bankruptcy court  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of dna sciences  inc for million  inclusive of related fees and expenses 
included in the fees and expenses is  which represents the fair value of warrants exercisable for up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share issued in connection with investment banking services performed  as well as  which represents the fair value of  shares of our common stock we issued to a licensor in connection with a license modification 
the primary assets acquired consisted of a glp compliant dna banking and a glp compliant and clia licensed genotyping services business and licenses and patent estates surrounding long qt syndrome and a thiopurine s methyltransferase tpmt test as well as certain trade accounts receivable and fixed assets 
subsequent to the closing  we entered into an amendment to an existing license agreement the tpmt amendment with prometheus laboratories  inc under which we provided certain additional rights to the tpmt test for a  cash payment  which is included in license and service revenue in the accompanying statement of operations 
by combining dna sciences offerings of glp compliant dna banking and glp compliant genotyping services with our hap technology and high throughput research genotyping capabilities  we provide a broader range of offerings for the application of pharmacogenomics to the clinical development and marketing of drugs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from estimates  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition valuation of long lived assets research and development expenses revenue recognition 
we earn our revenues primarily through the licensing of our hap technology and by providing research genotyping services and glp compliant dna banking and genotyping services 
we have also entered into agreements which provide for us to receive future milestones and royalty payments 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab which supercedes staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position  and emerging issues task force issue  arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
in accordance with sab and eitf  we recognize annual license and subscription fees over the term of the agreement and service fees as the services are performed 
for agreements with multiple deliverables  revenue is not recognized unless the fair value of the undelivered elements can be determined and the elements delivered have stand alone value to the customer 
future milestones and royalty payment  if any  will be recognized when received provided that the milestone is substantive and a culmination of the earnings process has occurred 
deferred revenue results from cash received or amounts receivable in advance of revenue recognition 
the timing of revenue recognition is dependent on when contracts are signed and data is delivered and can fluctuate significantly between periods 
valuation of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment review  include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  and a significant decrease in the market value of assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable  based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we compare the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the group 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment charge may be needed 
to determine the amount of the impairment charge  we compare the carrying value of the applicable fixed asset group to its fair value 
we determine the fair value of the fixed asset group by discounting expected future cash flow using a discount rate determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  such amount is recognized as an impairment charge 
if an impairment charge is required in future periods  it could result in a material  non cash charge in our statement of operations 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of fixed assets 
this charge related to sequencing equipment  computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements in our dna sequencing facility that we determined needed to be reviewed for potential impairment 
as a result of our review  we determined that the carrying value of the assets was in excess of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset group and we recorded a write down of million 
we continue to review our fixed assets for potential impairment and  based upon our current cash flow projections  have determined that there has not been an additional impairment of our fixed assets 
research and development expenses 
we record research and development expenses when they are incurred 
research and development expenses include the following major types of costs salaries and benefits  material and reagent costs  research license fees  clinical trial expenses  depreciation and amortization of laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements and building and utility costs related to research space 
we expense clinical trial costs as incurred based on information we receive from third parties and estimates that we make 
our estimates may change as additional information becomes available which could cause results to vary from period to period 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue consists primarily of revenue recognized in connection with the licensing of our hap technology and from hap typing and glp compliant dna banking and genotyping services 
revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in revenue is attributable to the  license fee received from prometheus for their expanded rights to the tpmt test under the tpmt amendment and the approximately million of laboratory services revenue recognized for services provided by our glp compliant and clia licensed laboratory which we acquired through the purchase of certain of the net assets of dna sciences on may  the increase is also due to increased commercialization of our hap technology  including agreements entered into with millennium during and pfizer during revenue from j j prd  millennium and pfizer accounted for of our total revenue for revenue from gene logic  inc  j j prd and pfizer  inc accounted for of our total revenue in the contract with j j prd  which accounted for of our revenue in expired in january cost of laboratory services consists of payroll and benefits for personnel  materials and reagent costs  depreciation and maintenance and facility related costs incurred by our glp compliant facility which we acquired through the acquisition of certain of the assets of dna sciences in may  the cost of laboratory services is million for or of the revenue recognized by the glp facility 
we expect the cost of laboratory services to decrease as a percentage of sales as we grow our revenue in our glp operation 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefits for research and development personnel  materials and reagent costs  costs incurred in connection with clinical trials  depreciation expense and maintenance costs for equipment used for hap marker discovery and hap typing  technology license fees and facility related costs 
we expense our research and development costs as incurred 
research and development costs decreased to million in from million in except for clinical trial expenses  substantially all of our research and development expenditures are incurred in processing and analyzing gene information added to our hap database 
the following is a breakdown of research and development expenses in thousands year ended december  year ended december  payroll and benefits   depreciation and amortization   material and reagent costs   technology license fees  repairs and maintenance  stock based compensation clinical trial expenses other   total   the decrease in research and development expenses in is primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million in technology license fees and a decrease of approximately million in depreciation and amortization  which were partially offset by an increase of approximately  in material and reagent costs associated with the discovery of new hap markers 
in addition  in we recognized a net credit of  for clinical trial expense based on revised information received from a clinical research organization for work performed in the decrease in technology license fees is due to the expiration of a license agreement in december the decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to the asset impairment charge recorded in the quarter end june  as a result of the removal of the majority of our dna analyzers from production 
the increase in material and reagent costs is primarily due to an increase in production  particularly in our hap typing laboratory 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development expenses in the near future as we continue to develop our hap technology and continue to invest in ongoing product development and improvements related to our decogen informatics system 
one of our strategic goals is to in license a compound for clinical development 
should that occur  our research and development expenses would increase 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefits for executive  business development  finance and other administrative personnel  as well as facility related costs and outside professional fees incurred in connection with corporate development  general legal and financial matters 
general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately million in from million in the decrease in general and administrative expenses in is due to a general reduction in expenses as part of our cost reduction program initiated during other expense for represents a loss on leased equipment of approximately  as a result of our disposition of assets upon an early termination of capital lease agreements 
interest expense decreased to approximately  in from million in the decrease is primarily due to recording additional interest expense during  in connection with certain events of default under our capital lease agreements with ge and finova 
during  we received notices from ge and finova claiming that an event of default had occurred under our lease agreements 
because of the alleged default  ge and finova each declared that all principal and future interest obligations were immediately due and payable 
in march  we settled the default claim with ge 
as a result of finova s outstanding default claim  we recorded an additional interest charge of approximately million  which represented the future interest due under the finova lease agreements in during  we terminated our agreements with both ge and finova and paid all outstanding amounts due under the lease agreements 
interest income decreased to approximately  in from million in the decrease is the result of higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances in and lower interest rates on investments during state income tax expense benefit increased to a benefit of  in from an expense of  in the benefit represents a net tax benefit from the state of connecticut the state as a result of legislation which allows companies to receive cash refunds from the state at a rate of of their incremental research and development tax credit  as defined  in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of the research and development tax credit 
the state had allowed the exchange program to lapse for the tax year  however  during  the state passed legislation to reinstate the program for the through tax years and  therefore  we recorded a benefit for the and tax years during equity in loss of affiliate of  in represents our percentage interest in the unaudited losses of sciona limited sciona based on our equity interest in sciona 
in november  we granted sciona a license to our technology in exchange for an equity interest 
the loss recognized relates only to the portion of the year in which we had an equity interest in sciona 
we expect that the loss from sciona will average approximately  per quarter for as sciona develops its products and commercialization plans 
during the fourth quarter of  we issued shares of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock and immediately recognized a charge of million associated with the beneficial conversion feature embedded in the preferred stock 
in addition  we granted a warrant to purchase additional shares of preferred stock and will recognize a charge of approximately  for the beneficial conversion feature embedded in the warrant over the life of the warrant 
if the warrant is exercised prior to its expiration  we will immediately recognize any remaining charges associated with this beneficial conversion feature 
years ended december  and revenue consists primarily of proceeds received in connection with the licensing our hap technology  service revenue and sublicensing of patents 
revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in license revenues is attributable to the commercialization of our hap technology  including agreements entered into with biogen during  astrazeneca during and j j prd during revenue from gene logic  j j prd and pfizer accounted for and of our total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from each of these customers accounted for or more of our total revenue for and  respectively 
revenue for fiscal includes a payment received from j j prd in the fourth quarter for achieving a milestone 
we are recognizing the annual license and subscription fees over the term of the agreements and the service fees as the services are performed 
future milestone and royalty payments  when and if received  will be recognized when earned 
revenue also includes the amortization  over the remaining life of the sublicensed patent  of upfront payments received in connection with the sublicensing of a patent 
research and development costs decreased to million in from million in except for clinical trial expenses  substantially all of our research and development expenditures are incurred in processing and analyzing gene information added to our hap database 
the following is a breakdown of research and development expenses in thousands year ended december  year ended december  payroll and related expenses   depreciation and amortization   consumables   technology license fees   repairs and maintenance   stock based compensation clinical trial expenses  other   total   the decrease in research and development expenses in is primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million in expenditures related to our clinical trials  a decrease of approximately million in material and reagent costs associated with the discovery of new hap markers  a decrease of approximately million in payroll and related costs and a decrease of approximately million in technology license fees 
the decrease in clinical trial expenses is primarily due to the strength trials  which were substantially completed by december  the decrease in material and reagent costs is primarily due to a reduction in dna sequencing consistent with the removal of the majority of our dna analyzers from production in the quarter ended june  the decrease in payroll and related costs is primarily due to the work force reduction in connection with our restructuring program 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefits for executive  business development  finance  public affairs and other administrative personnel  as well as facility related costs and outside professional fees incurred in connection with corporate development  general legal and financial matters 
general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately million in from million in the decrease in general and administrative expenses in is primarily due to a million decrease in consulting and professional service fees and a general reduction in expenses as part of our cost reduction program initiated during the million impairment of fixed assets charge relates to sequencing equipment  computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements in our dna sequencing facility 
during the quarter ended june   management determined that certain conditions had arisen during the quarter that triggered the need for a review of our long lived assets for potential impairment 
these conditions included  but were not limited to  the overall business climate in which we operate and a significant change in the manner in which we were utilizing our dna sequencing facility and related assets 
in particular  during the quarter ended june   we determined that our sequencing production capacity significantly exceeded our forecasted demand for the foreseeable future  which resulted in our decision to remove from production the majority of its abi prism dna analyzers  the primary assets of the group 
accordingly  we performed an impairment review on our sequencing long lived assets 
as a result of the review  we determined that the carrying value of the assets was in excess of the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset group 
to determine the amount of the impairment charge  we compared the carrying value of the applicable fixed assets to their fair value 
we determined the fair value of the fixed assets by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in its current business 
as a result of the analysis  we determined that the carrying value of the assets was in excess of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset group and we recorded a write down of million 
the impairment charge has been allocated to the individual assets on a pro rata basis 
the revised carrying value of the assets is being depreciated over the average remaining life of the primary assets of the group 
interest expense increased to approximately million in from million in the increase is primarily due to recording additional interest expense during the quarter ended december   in connection with certain events of default 
in december  we received a notice from ge claiming that an event of default had occurred under our lease agreement as a result of an alleged material adverse change in our business 
because of the alleged default  ge declared that all principal and future interest obligations were immediately due and payable 
ge also filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of connecticut  demanding payment of all amounts due under the lease agreement 
we also received a notice from finova  stating that as a result of the default claim by ge  there had been a cross default under the agreement with finova 
finova declared that all principal and future interest obligations were immediately due and payable 
in march  we settled the claim with ge and simultaneously amended our lease agreement 
in connection with the amendment  ge retroactively rescinded their default claim and both parties have withdrawn from any legal action 
as we had not entered into a settlement agreement with finova  we recorded an additional charge to interest expense to reflect the fact that all future interest and principal is currently due and payable under the finova capital lease agreement 
interest income decreased to approximately million in from million in the decrease is the result of higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances in and the much lower interest rates on investments during state income tax expense benefit decreased to an expense of  in from a benefit of million in the benefit represents a net tax benefit from the state of connecticut as a result of legislation which allowed companies to receive cash refunds from the state at a rate of of their incremental research and development tax credit  as defined  in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of the research and development tax credit 
the state of connecticut rescinded the legislation in liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements have historically consisted  and we expect that they will continue to consist  of capital expenditures  working capital  business development expenses  debt service  research and development expenses  general corporate expenses and acquisitions 
we have financed our operations primarily through the private and public sale of common and preferred stock  government research grants  payments under licensing agreements  loans and capital leases 
from inception through december   we have received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of common and preferred stock 
in addition  through december   we have received million of government grant funding and million from license and service fees  royalties and research contracts 
we also have received million from capital lease financing arrangements and million from other loans 
through december   we have acquired million of property and equipment 
these assets were largely financed through capital lease financing arrangements and other loans 
cash and cash equivalents at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million compared to approximately million at december  our cash reserves are held in interest bearing  high grade corporate bonds and money market accounts 
financing activities preferred stock financing in october  we sold  shares of newly designated redeemable convertible series a preferred stock preferred stock  
par value per share  to an accredited investor for per share  resulting in proceeds of approximately million  net of issuance costs of approximately  in addition  the investor was granted a warrant to purchase an additional  shares of series a preferred stock through december  at per share 
we recorded the warrant at its estimated relative fair market value of  as a discount to the series a preferred stock carrying value 
the discount is being accreted over the period from the date of issuance to the first potential redemption date see below which results in a higher recorded dividend charge 
the investor is required to exercise the warrant if our stock closes above for consecutive business days 
the preferred stock earns dividends at the rate of per annum payable in cash semi annually in january and july 
each share of preferred stock is convertible into ten shares of common stock at the option of the shareholder 
on or after october   we can require the conversion of the preferred stock if our stock has traded above for consecutive business days 
we will be required to redeem  unless the holders of at least of the preferred stock elect otherwise  all of the outstanding shares if a significant event  as defined  occurs prior to october  or if we breach certain representations or covenants included in the certificate of designations  purchase agreement or registration rights agreement relating to the preferred stock 
the redemption price would equal the sum of the accreted value of the preferred stock  plus all accrued dividends  plus the sum of all dividends that would have accrued through october  in addition  the investor has the option to require that we redeem all of the outstanding shares of preferred stock on either october   or  at a redemption price equal to the accreted value of the preferred stock plus all accrued dividends 
we may delay such payment for up to one year  in which case the dividend rate would increase to per annum 
during the fourth quarter of  we immediately recognized a charge of million associated with the beneficial conversion features embedded in the preferred stock 
in addition  we will recognize a charge of approximately  for the beneficial conversion features embedded in the warrant over the warrant exercise period 
term loan financing in september  we entered into a million loan and security agreement with comerica bank  na comerica 
the agreement requires equal monthly payments of principal over a month period and bears interest at prime at december  plus 
borrowings under the agreement are secured by certain of our assets 
under the terms of the agreement  we are required to satisfy certain financial covenants  including maintenance of a minimum unrestricted cash balance and a minimum quick ratio  as defined 
we were in compliance with such financial covenants as of december  in connection with our loan agreement  we also issued a warrant to comerica  exercisable through september   to purchase  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
capital lease pre payments prior to closing the loan agreement with comerica  we elected to prepay certain capital lease obligations with finova and newcourt financial usa  inc newcourt and paid all amounts due  including any end of lease buy out provisions for equipment retained 
in connection with the finova agreement  we paid a total of million  which included a prepayment discount of approximately  that was credited to interest expense in under their original terms  the lease schedules covered by the finova agreement would have expired between november and august in connection with the newcourt agreement  we paid a total of approximately  which represented all future interest and principal due under the lease schedules which  by their original terms  would have expired in november and december we disposed of certain equipment financed under certain of the lease schedules and recorded an additional charge of approximately  related to this equipment 
in connection with the buyout  finova and newcourt released their liens on all purchased equipment 
in october  we terminated our capital lease obligations with general electric capital corporation ge and paid all outstanding obligations due to ge  including the end of lease buy out provisions 
under their original terms  the lease schedules covered by the ge agreement would have expired between october and february we made a payment of million to ge  which represented all principal and interest through the date of buyout as well as a prepayment penalty of approximately  as a result of the termination of the lease  million of previously restricted cash was released and we received full title to the equipment 
during the fourth quarter of we recorded a charge of approximately  in connection with the termination 
cash flows cash used in operations for the year ended december   was million compared with million for the same period in the cash used in operations for the year ended december  resulted primarily from a net loss of million and a million increase in accounts receivable and other current assets  partially offset by million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense  loss on leased equipment  stock based compensation and the loss in the equity of an affiliate 
the cash used in operations for the year ended december  resulted primarily from a net loss of million and a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense and impairment of fixed assets  a million increase in deferred revenue and a million decrease in inventory  state income tax receivable and other current assets including the receipt  in september  of million from the state of connecticut for the sale of research and development tax credits 
cash provided by investing activities was million in compared with million in during  we used million of cash to purchase certain of the assets of dna sciences  inc in addition  during we used million for the purchase of property and equipment  received net proceeds of million from the sale and maturity of investments in marketable securities and had the restriction removed on million of cash which was provided as collateral in connection with a certain capital lease agreement we terminated in in  we used cash to purchase  of property and equipment and received proceeds of million from the liquidation of investments in marketable securities and used cash to purchase million of marketable securities 
in addition  in  we were required to provide cash collateral of million in connection with the letter of credit issued as part of an amendment to a capital lease agreement 
cash used in financing activities was  in compared to cash used in financing activities of million in during  we received cash of approximately million from the issuance of preferred stock and million from long term debt 
in addition  we terminated all of our capital lease agreements which resulted in the repayment of approximately million in lease obligations and the removal of the restriction on million of cash provided as collateral in connection with the ge capital lease 
during  we repaid debt of approximately million 
contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations as of december   are as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total fiscal fiscal years and fiscal years and fiscal year and later long term debt  including interest     operating leases      minimum license obligations  total contractual cash obligations     long term debt consists primarily of three financing agreements with connecticut innovations  inc cii and an agreement with comerica 
the funds received from cii were used to finance certain leasehold improvements and other costs associated with our facility expansion 
each cii agreement provides for monthly payments of principal and interest  based on a month amortization  with final balloon payments due in march through june borrowings under the agreements bear interest at and are secured by the related leasehold improvements 
the funds received from comerica were used to refinance certain of the amounts due under several capital lease agreements 
the agreement requires ratable repayment of principal over a month period and bears interest at the prime rate plus 
borrowings under the agreement are secured by certain of our assets 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  we lease our operating facilities located in new haven  connecticut and morrisville  north carolina 
the connecticut lease agreements require annual lease payments of million per year over the original term which expires in we have two five year renewal options to extend the lease agreements beyond the initial term and we have assumed that one five year renewal option was exercised in the table above 
we are recording the expense associated with the lease on a straight line basis over the expected term of the lease 
the north carolina agreement requires annual lease payments of approximately  through february  either party may cancel the north carolina lease by providing months notice to the other party 
we expect to move to a different facility in north carolina in the second half of at a reduced rental rate 
in addition to the operating lease agreements for our current facilities  we also have operating leases for various office equipment 
in addition  we periodically enter into agreements with third parties to obtain exclusive or non exclusive licenses for certain technologies 
the terms of certain of these agreements require us to pay future royalty payments and certain milestone payments based on product sales or sublicense income generated from applicable technologies  if any 
the amount of such payments will depend upon successful commercialization of applicable technologies  if any 
the future minimum payments assuming non termination of these leases are included in the minimum license obligations above 
short term funding requirements we believe that our existing cash reserves will be sufficient to fund our expected net losses  debt obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next months based upon our current activities 
for the next months  we expect to continue to finance our operations from cash we received in october from the sale of our series a preferred stock and revenue from our hap technology customers and our pharmacogenomic support service customers 
our business strategy depends on  among other things  entering into hap technology agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
if we are unsuccessful in marketing our programs and growing our service revenues  we may not generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations at planned levels 
during the next months  we expect to expend substantial funds to conduct research and development activities and other general and administrative activities 
our expenditures for these activities will include required payments under operating leases and long term debt agreements and licensing  collaboration and service agreements as noted in the table above 
capital expenditures are not currently expected to exceed million for each of fiscal and long term funding requirements for periods beyond months  even if we grow our revenues significantly  we will need to seek additional funding through public or private equity financings  debt financings or commercial customers 
our business strategy depends on  among other things  entering into partnership agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and growing the revenue from our pharmacogenomic support services business 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain additional customers or capital funding on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining new customers for our hap technology  growing the revenue from our pharmacogenomic support services business  or obtaining additional financing funds  we may not generate sufficient funds to sustain our operations at planned levels  and we may have to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of aspects of our business development activities 
in addition  we cannot incur indebtedness above certain levels or issue any capital stock or other equity securities having rights  preferences  privileges or priorities pari passu with or senior to the series a preferred stock without the vote or written consent of holders of at least of the series a shares then outstanding 
our cash requirements in the long term will vary depending upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including our ability to retain and find new customers for our hap technology  our ability to grow profitably our pharmacogenomic support services business  whether we are successfully able to in license a drug candidate  the commercialization of intellectual property derived from our hap technology  the level of competition we face  acquisition costs or other non recurring charges in connection with the acquisition of companies  products or technologies  our ability to maintain and develop our hap technology  and our ability to manage effectively our operating expenses 
income taxes we have not generated any taxable income to date and  therefore  have not paid any federal income taxes since inception 
on december   we had available unused net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  which may be available to offset future federal and state taxable income  respectively 
use of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  which will begin to expire in and  respectively  may be subject to limitations 
the future utilization of these carryforwards may be limited due to changes within our current and future ownership structure 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which consists primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  because of uncertainty regarding their recoverability  as required by statement of financial accounting standards no

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition sab  which supercedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the primary purpose of sab is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab adoption of sab was required immediately and did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which was issued in january fin r clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r  which was issued in january  requires the consolidation of these entities  known as variable interest entities vies  by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the entity  if any  that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
among other changes  the revisions of fin r clarified some requirements of the original fin  eased some implementation problems and added new scope exceptions 
fin r deferred the effective date of the interpretation for public companies to the end of the first reporting period ending after march   except that all public companies must  at a minimum  apply the provisions of the interpretation to entities that were previously considered special purpose entities under the fasb literature prior to the issuance of fin r by the end of the first reporting period ending after december  during the year ended december   adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
fin r will require reassessment in future periods 
in november  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf issue no 
requires tabular disclosure of the amount of unrealized losses and the related fair value of investments with unrealized losses aggregated for each category of investment that is disclosed in accordance with sfas no 
in addition  it requires sufficient narrative disclosure to allow financial statement users to understand both the aggregated tabular information and the positive and negative information considered in reaching the conclusion that the impairments are not other than temporary 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
specifies that instruments within its scope embody obligations of the issuer and that the issuer must classify them as liabilities 
sfas no 
requires issuers to classify as liabilities the following three types of freestanding financial instruments mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  obligations to repurchase the issuer s equity shares by transferring assets  and certain obligations to issue a variable number of shares 
sfas no 
defines a freestanding financial instrument as a financial instrument that is entered into separately and apart from any of the entity s other financial instruments or equity transactions or is entered into in conjunction with some other transaction and can be legally detached and exercised on a separate basis 
for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   sfas no 
is effective immediately 
for all other instruments of public companies  sfas no 
went into effect at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb deferred the effective date for selected provisions of sfas no 
 limited to mandatorily redeemable  noncontrolling interests associated with finite lived subsidiaries 
the deferral of those selected provisions is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
factors affecting future operating results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
for this purpose  statements contained herein regarding our strategy  future operations  financial position  future revenues  projected costs  prospects  plans and objectives of management  other than statements of historical fact may be forward looking statements 
the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements  although not all forward looking statements contain these identifying words 
we cannot guarantee that we will actually achieve the plans  intentions or expectations expressed or implied in our forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause actual results  levels of activity  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied 
these important factors include our critical accounting estimates and the factors set forth below 
we are an early stage company with a history of losses and we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future such that we may never be profitable 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception 
for example  for the fiscal years ended december  and  we had an operating loss of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we have generated only minimal revenue from our hap technology and our pharmacogenomic support services  and we do not expect to generate significant revenues for several years 
from inception through december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses to date have resulted principally from costs we incurred in the development of our hap technology  in our clinical trials and from general and administrative costs associated with operations 
we expect to devote substantially all of our resources to service our hap technology customers and strength program customers  our pharmacogenomic support services customers and our caring and long qt genetic programs and to maintain our hap technology 
we expect to incur additional losses this year and in future years  and we may never achieve profitability 
in addition  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are only now beginning to use products such as ours in their drug and diagnostic development or marketing efforts and  accordingly  they may not choose to use our hap technology 
we do not expect our losses to be substantially mitigated by revenues from our hap technology customers and strength programs  and our caring and long qt genetic programs  if any  or from our pharmacogenomic support services for a number of years 
we currently rely on a limited number of licensing and service arrangements for substantially all of our revenues 
as a result  the loss of one major customer or our inability to secure additional significant customers during a given period would have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we are dependent upon a limited number of licensing and service arrangements that represent substantially all of our revenues 
in the year ended december   three of our customers  j j prd  millennium pharmaceuticals  inc and pfizer  inc  accounted for of our revenues 
the agreement with one of the customers who accounted for of the revenue for the year expired in the first quarter of no other customer accounted for or more of our revenues in the year ended december  if we are unable to replace in a timely fashion  upon substantially similar financial terms  the agreement that expired in the first quarter of  or if we lose and are not able to replace customers that provide us with significant revenues  it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and on our business in general and could cause volatility or a decline in our stock price 
to generate significant revenues  we must obtain additional customers for our hap technology and our strength  caring and long qt genetic programs and for our pharmacogenomic support services 
our strategy depends on entering into agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for our hap technology and our strength  caring and long qt genetic programs and obtaining additional customers for our pharmacogenomic support services 
our contracts with many of our hap technology customers and for our pharmacogenomic support services are for specific limited term projects 
we may not be successful in obtaining additional customers for our hap technology and our strength program or obtaining any customers for our caring or long qt genetic programs or obtain sufficient new customers for our pharmacogenomic support services to replace our current projects 
if we are unsuccessful in finding additional customers for our hap technology and our strength program or in finding any customers for our caring or long qt genetic programs or new customers for our pharmacogenomic support services  we may never generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
in addition  we expect that some of our future hap technology collaborations  like some of our current hap technology collaborations  will be limited to specific  limited term projects or that some of these collaborations may not be renewed 
accordingly  we must continually obtain new customers to be successful 
to date  the integration of pharmacogenomics into drug development and marketing has not achieved widespread market acceptance 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly and any failure to meet financial expectations may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our common stock price 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect they will fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our common stock price to decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include recognition of non recurring revenues due to receipt of license fees  achievement of milestones  completion of contracts or other revenues  demand for and market acceptance of our hap technology  strength  caring and long qt genetic programs and for our pharmacogenomic support services  timing of the execution of agreements on our hap technology  strength  caring and long qt genetic programs and other material contracts  our competitors announcements or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations  acquisition costs or other non recurring charges in connection with the acquisition of companies  products or technologies  our ability to control operating expenses  disputes regarding patents or other intellectual property rights  securities class actions or other litigation  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the united states and other major regions in which we conduct business  and general and industry specific economic conditions  which may affect our customers use of our hap technology 
due to volatile and unpredictable revenues and operating expenses  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly or decline 
if the estimates we make  and the assumptions on which we rely  in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate  our actual results may vary from those reflected in our projections 
our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the amounts of charges we accrue and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
for example  we have recorded certain patent estates as long term intangible assets based on their value at the date of acquisition 
events could occur that would cause us to re evaluate the life of those assets and  therefore  whether those assets have been impaired  resulting in an impairment charge 
we based the estimates we make on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable at the time and under the circumstances 
if the estimates relating to our patent estate are determined to be incorrect  a write down may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
there can be no assurance that any of our estimates or the assumptions underlying our estimates will be correct 
we may require additional funding to fund operations and repay debt and we may not be able to obtain any 
we have used substantial amounts of cash to fund our research and development activities 
we will continue to spend funds to service our hap technology customers and strength program customers  our pharmacogenomic support services customers and our caring and long qt genetic programs and to maintain our hap technology 
we plan to pay for these activities with funds from our existing cash and investment securities  income that we may receive from our hap technology customers and strength program customers and pharmacogenomic support services customers  and proceeds that we may receive from the exercise of our outstanding series a preferred stock warrant 
we intend to rely on our current hap technology customers and strength program customers and future program customers  if any  and our current pharmacogenomic support services customers and future customers  if any  for significant funding in the future to support our development efforts 
to execute our business plans  we will need to grow our revenues significantly each year 
we cannot be certain when we will begin to receive additional income  if at all  from our hap technology and strength programs and our pharmacogenomic support services and income  if any  from our caring and long qt genetic programs 
if we do not receive this income or do not receive it as rapidly as we expect  we would spend our existing cash and investment securities more rapidly than we currently plan 
we believe that our existing cash reserves will be sufficient to support our expected net losses  debt obligations and capital expenditures for at least months 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new customers or to generate the increased revenues required to meet our business plan objectives 
in addition  to execute our business plans  we may need to seek additional funding through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or through commercial customers 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain additional customers or capital funding on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues or access capital on acceptable terms  we may be required to obtain funds on unfavorable terms that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or that would significantly dilute our stockholders and or significantly scale back current operations 
either of these two possibilities would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our hap technology may not allow our commercial customers to develop commercial products or to increase sales of their marketed products 
we developed our hap technology on the assumption that information about gene variation and gene variation associated with drug response may help drug development professionals better understand the drug response of particular populations and complex disease processes 
although the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are increasing their use of genomics in analyzing drug response and diseases  we are aware of only one successful drug program applying population genomics 
we discover hap markers for pharmaceutically relevant genes 
if we are unable to find hap markers for pharmaceutically relevant genes in a timely manner  our potential customers may lose confidence in our hap technology and in our company  which could decrease our ability to generate revenues 
even if we are able to discover hap markers for pharmaceutically relevant genes  this information may not prove to be superior to genomic variation information discovered by our competitors 
furthermore  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may not choose our hap technology over competing technologies 
our decogen informatics system may also be less effective than we expect or may not allow us or our commercial customers to determine a correlation between drug response and genomic variation 
furthermore  even if we or our customers are successful in identifying such a correlation  our customers may not be able to develop or sell commercially viable products nor may our customers be able to increase the sales of their marketed products using this correlation 
accordingly  our hap markers and hap technology may not improve the development  marketing and prescribing of drugs or the development and marketing of diagnostics developed by our hap technology customers and strength program customers 
we may be unable to develop or commercialize our hap technology if we cannot establish additional customers and we will depend on our customers to develop or to co develop products 
we currently have a number of customers for our hap technology as well as an agreement with a major diagnostic company to commercialize exclusively the diagnostic rights and non exclusively the product development rights from our strength program 
we do not currently have any customers for our caring or long qt genetic programs 
as a result  part of our current and future revenues will depend on payments from our current hap technology customers and strength program customers and our future hap technology customers if any  and future strength  caring and long qt genetic program customers  if any  for either the new products they may develop  or for increased sales of their existing products  made possible through the use of our hap technology 
if we are unable to attract new hap technology customers program and strength program customers or any customers for our caring and long qt genetic programs  we may never generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
our customers for our hap technology and our customers from our strength program and our customers  if any  for our caring and long qt genetic programs  will be responsible for pre clinical study and clinical development of therapeutic and diagnostic products and for regulatory approval  manufacturing and marketing of any products or enhanced marketing claims that result from the application of our hap technology 
our current agreements with these customers  and we anticipate that any future agreements with customers  will allow them significant discretion in pursuing these activities 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that any such current or potential customers will devote to our programs or potential products 
our hap technology and strength program arrangements and our caring and long qt genetic program arrangements  if any  may also have the effect of limiting the areas of research that we may pursue either alone or with others 
because part of our revenues will be dependent on the successful commercialization or development of our customers products  if  for any reason  a hap technology or a strength program customer delays or abandons its development or commercialization of a product developed using our hap technology  we may receive reduced royalty or other payments or no royalty or other payments at all 
in addition  because part of our future revenues will be dependent on the successful commercialization by our customers of any therapeutic and diagnostic products that may result from our hap technology and strength programs as well as the successful commercialization of our caring and long qt genetic programs with customers  if  for any reason  a customer delays or abandons its development or commercialization of these aspects of our hap technology or strength program or its development or commercialization of our caring and long qt genetic programs  we may receive reduced royalty or other payments or no royalty or other payments at all 
although we intend to retain the rights to all hap markers which we discover as well as to any hap markers discovered jointly with our hap technology customers and strength program customers and with our caring and long qt genetic program customers  if any  we have not always and may not always be able to negotiate the retention of these rights 
furthermore  disputes may arise in the future over the ownership of rights to hap markers as well as any other technology we develop with our hap technology customers and strength program customers or with our caring and long qt genetic program customers  if any 
these and other possible disagreements between us and our hap technology customers and strength program customers or between us and our caring and long qt genetic program customers  if any  could lead to delays in the research  development or commercialization of their products 
these disagreements could also result in litigation or require arbitration to resolve 
any of these events could prevent us from effectively marketing our hap technology 
we invest considerable amounts of time  effort  and money to license our hap technology and  if we are unable to license our technology  we may not generate sufficient revenue to sustain our operations 
our ability to obtain customers for our hap technology and our strength  caring and long qt genetic programs will depend in significant part upon the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries acceptance that our hap technology can help accelerate or improve their drug and diagnostic development and marketing efforts 
to achieve market acceptance  we must continue to educate the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and the public in general as to the potential benefits of our hap technology  strength  caring and long qt genetic programs 
most importantly  we must convince the research and development  clinical and marketing departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that our hap technology can accelerate and improve the processes for developing  marketing and prescribing drugs and for developing and marketing diagnostics and that our hap technology  strength  caring and long qt genetic programs will be commercially viable 
if we fail to gain this acceptance  we may never generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
we may expend substantial funds and management effort to market our hap technology  strength  caring and long qt genetic programs  without any resulting revenues 
our ability to make any acquisition is dependent on the availability of adequate cash and the attractiveness of our stock price 
we anticipate that any future acquisitions of businesses or technologies will be financed through cash from operations  the issuance of shares of our common stock and or seller financing 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient existing capital resources or that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital resources on terms satisfactory to us  if at all  in order to meet our capital requirements for such acquisitions 
we also believe that a significant factor in our ability to close acquisitions using stock as consideration will be the attractiveness of our common stock for potential acquisition candidates 
this attractiveness may  in large part  be dependent upon the relative market price and capital appreciation prospects of our common stock compared to the equity securities of our competitors 
the trading price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market could in the future materially adversely affect our acquisition program 
because our strategy envisions that a part of our future revenue growth will come from making future acquisitions of businesses or technologies  if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or unable to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us  our future revenues may be adversely impacted and we may experience slower revenue growth 
integration or acquisitions or strategic investments could interrupt our business and our financial condition could be harmed 
from time to time  we may acquire or make strategic investments in other businesses or technologies 
for example  on may   pursuant to the approval of the united states bankruptcy court  we purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of dna sciences 
in addition  on december   we entered into a merger agreement to acquire lark technologies  inc the acquisition of dna sciences and the pending lark acquisition  as well as any other acquisitions or strategic investments we may make in the future  entail numerous risks that include the following difficulties integrating any acquired operations  personnel  technologies or products  diversion of management s focus from our core business concerns  entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience or knowledge  exposure to litigation from stockholders or creditors of  or other parties affiliated with  the target company or companies  dilution to existing stockholders and earnings per share  and incurrence of substantial debt 
any such difficulties encountered as a result of a merger  acquisition or strategic investment could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to prevent others from unauthorized use of  or are unable to defend their use of  our hap technology  trade secrets or know how  we may not be able to operate our business profitably 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
the issuance of a patent does not guarantee that it is valid or enforceable 
thus  even if we obtain patents  they may not be valid or enforceable against third parties 
because patent applications that were filed prior to november  in the united states are confidential until patents issue  third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without us being aware of those applications  and our patent applications may not have priority over any patent applications of others 
we are aware that there are other firms and individuals who have discovered  or are currently discovering  information similar to the information we are discovering  who may have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications that are similar or identical to our hap technology patent applications 
in addition  some interest groups are lobbying for restrictions on patenting of genetic tests 
further  a patent does not provide the patent holder with freedom to operate in a way that infringes the patent rights of others 
a third party may sue us for infringing on its patent rights 
likewise  we may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
the cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial  and the litigation would divert our management s focus from our core business concerns 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations 
we also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and improvements  unpatented know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we generally protect this information with reasonable security measures  including confidentiality agreements signed by our employees  academic collaborators and consultants that provide that all confidential information developed or made known to others during the course of the employment  consulting or business relationship will be kept confidential except in specified circumstances 
agreements with employees  consultants and collaborators generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while employed by us are our exclusive property 
if employees  consultants or collaborators do not honor these agreements  we may not have adequate remedies for breach 
furthermore  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
if any party should successfully claim that the creation or use of our hap technology or hap marker association data infringes upon their intellectual property rights  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  a court could require us to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license on unfavorable terms 
moreover  any legal action against us or any of our program customers claiming damages or seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to the affected products and processes could  in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages  require us or our hap technology customers and our strength program customers or any caring and long qt genetic program customers  if any  to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes 
any license required under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  some licenses may be non exclusive and  therefore  our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  we may be unable to market effectively some of our hap technology  which could limit our profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations 
regulatory oversight of our hap technology and public opinion regarding ethical issues surrounding the use of genetic information may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services 
currently  there is limited food and drug administration fda regulation of genetic tests 
the secretary s advisory committee on genetic testing  an advisory panel to the secretary of the us department of health and human services  has recommended that the fda expand its regulation of genetic testing to require fda approval for all new genetic tests and labeling of genetic tests 
if the fda adopts this recommendation  it may require that we  or our customers  apply for fda approval as a prerequisite to marketing genetic tests that incorporate our products and services 
if the fda were to deny any application of this kind  it could adversely affect our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
the fda has only once required that a physician must have genomic variation information determined about a patient before the doctor prescribes a drug 
in this one instance  the fda has stipulated that this requirement can be fulfilled with either gene expression information or genomic variation information 
on november   the fda issued draft guidance that encourages drug and biologic developers to conduct pharmacogenomic tests during drug development and clarified how the fda will evaluate the resulting data 
the guidance provides specific criteria and recommendations on the submission of pharmacogenomic data in connection with investigational new drug applications  new drug applications and biological license applications 
the guidance includes information on the type of data needed and how the fda will or will not use such data in regulatory decisions 
the fda asked for voluntary submissions of research information in order to gain experience as the field of pharmacogenomics evolves 
the fda advised that the agency would not use information from voluntary reports for regulatory decisions on the drug or biologic with which the voluntary data is associated 
in addition  the fda held a workshop on november  and november  to discuss its draft guidance and stated that the agency plans in the near future to issue further guidance on the co development of a pharmacogenomic test and drug 
our success will depend  in part  on how rapidly the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry implements the guidance and  accordingly  the validity of our products and services as a basis for identifying genomic variation and for correlating drug response with genomic variation 
without this implementation by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry  we may be unable to market effectively any products we may have as well as any of our services and we may not generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
within the field of personalized health and medicine  governmental and other entities may enact patient privacy and healthcare laws and regulations that may limit the use of genomic variation data 
to the extent that these laws and regulations limit the use of our products and services or impose additional costs on our customers  we may be unable to market effectively our hap technology  strength  caring and long qt genetic programs and we may not generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
additionally  public opinion on ethical issues related to the confidentiality and appropriate use of genetic testing results may influence governmental authorities to call for limits on  or regulation of the use of  genetic testing 
in addition  governmental authorities or other entities may call for limits on  or regulation of the use of  genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions  particularly for those that have no known cure 
the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the potential markets for our products and services  which could prevent us from generating sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
furthermore  we may be directly subject to regulations as a provider of diagnostic information 
to the extent that these regulations restrict the sale of our products and services or impose other costs  we may be unable to provide our products and services to our customers on terms sufficient to recover our expenses 
if our customers do not seek  or do not receive  marketing approval for products developed  if any  using our hap technology  we may receive delayed royalty or other payments or no royalty or other payments at all 
any new drug  biologic or new drug or biologic indication our customers develop using our hap technology must undergo an extensive regulatory review process in the united states and other countries before a new product or indication of this kind could be marketed 
this regulatory process can take many years and require substantial expense 
changes in fda policies and the policies of similar foreign regulatory bodies can prolong the regulatory review of each new drug or biologic license application or prevent approval of the application 
we expect similar delays and risks in the regulatory review process for any diagnostic product developed by our customers  whenever this regulatory review is required 
even if a product obtains marketing clearance  a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continuing review 
a manufacturer may be forced to withdraw a product from the market if a previously unknown problem with a product becomes apparent 
because our future revenues will be dependent on the successful commercialization or development of products using our hap technology  any delay of our customers in obtaining  failing to obtain  or failing to maintain regulatory approval for a product developed using our hap technology may delay our receipt of royalty or other payments or prevent us from receiving royalty or other payments sufficient to recover our expenses 
if our customers are unable to obtain fda approval for therapeutic or diagnostic products developed using our hap technology  the lack of regulatory approval will diminish the value of our hap technology 
to date  no one has developed or commercialized any therapeutic product or commercialized any diagnostic product using our hap technology 
we expect to rely on our customers to file applications for regulatory approval and generally direct the regulatory review process and obtain fda acceptance of products developed with our hap technology and strength programs and our caring and long qt genetic programs  if any 
our program customers may not submit an application for regulatory review 
even if they do submit applications  they may not be able to obtain marketing clearance for any products on a timely basis  if at all 
if our customers fail to obtain required governmental clearances for therapeutic or diagnostic products  they will not be able to market these products unless and until they obtain these clearances 
as a result  we may not receive royalty or other payments from our customers 
the occurrence of any of these events may prevent us from generating revenues sufficient to sustain our operations 
if we do not successfully distinguish and commercialize our hap technology  we may be unable to compete successfully with our competitors or to generate revenue significant to sustain our operations 
numerous entities are attempting to identify genomic variation predictive of specific diseases and drug response and to develop products and services based on these discoveries 
we face competition in these areas from pharmaceutical  biotechnology and diagnostic companies  academic and research institutions and government and other publicly funded agencies  both in the united states and abroad  most of which have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs  facilities  manufacturing and marketing experience  distribution channels and human resources than do we 
these competitors may discover  characterize or develop important technologies applying population genomics before us or our customers for our hap technology and strength programs that are more effective than those technologies which we develop or which our customers for our hap technology and strength programs develop  or these competitors may obtain regulatory approvals of their drugs and diagnostics more rapidly than our customers for our hap technology and strength programs do  any of which could limit our ability to market effectively our hap technology 
some companies and governments are marketing or developing a number of databases and informatics tools to assist participants in the healthcare industry and academic researchers in the management and analysis of genomic data 
entities such as perlegen sciences  celera genomics group and the international hapmap project have developed or plan to develop databases containing gene sequence  genomic variation or other genomic information and are marketing or plan to market their data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or plan to make freely available their databases 
in addition  numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  such as glaxosmithkline plc  either alone or in collaboration with our competitors  are developing genomic research programs that involve the use of information that can be found in these databases 
furthermore  companies  such as decode genetics  inc  have technologies for using genetic variation in diagnostics and in the drug development process and have collaborations with companies employing these technologies 
genomic technologies have undergone  and are expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant change 
our future success will depend in large part on maintaining a competitive position in the genomics field 
others may rapidly develop new technologies that may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete before we recover the expenses that we incur in connection with the development of these products 
our hap technology could become obsolete if our competitors offer less expensive or more effective drug discovery and development technologies  including technologies that may be unrelated to genomics 
we depend on third party products and services and limited sources of supply for our sequencing and genotyping laboratories 
we rely on outside vendors to supply certain software  products and materials used in our laboratories 
some of these products and materials are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
for example  we have a written agreement with sequenom  inc pursuant to which it is contractually the sole provider of silicon chips for one time use on their massarray system  which is our genotyping platform 
under the terms of the agreement and subject to specific conditions  we have the authority to reuse these chips should sequenom be unable to supply new chips to us 
while we believe that we could prepare for reuse the requisite supply of chips that we would need without unreasonable cost or delay  we may be unable to do so 
we have no other written long term supply agreements with our suppliers 
our reliance on outside vendors generally and a sole or a limited group of suppliers in particular involves several other risks  including the inability to obtain an adequate supply of required software  products and materials due to capacity constraints  product defects  a discontinuance of a product by a supplier or other supply constraints  reduced control over quality and pricing of software  products and materials  and delays and long lead times in receiving software  products  or materials from vendors 
if we fail to maintain our computer hardware  software and related infrastructure  we could experience loss of  or delay in  revenues and market acceptance 
because our business requires manipulating and analyzing large amounts of data  we depend on the continuous  effective  reliable and secure operation of our computer hardware  software and related infrastructure 
to the extent that any of these elements malfunction  we will experience reduced productivity 
we protect our computer hardware through physical and software safeguards 
however  our computer hardware is still vulnerable to fire  weather  earthquake  or other natural disaster and power loss  telecommunications failures  physical or software break ins and similar events 
in addition  the software and algorithmic components of our decogen informatics system are complex and sophisticated  and as such  could contain data  design or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct 
users of our system may find software defects in current or future products 
if we fail to maintain the necessary computer capacity and data to support our computational needs and our customers drug and diagnostic discovery and development efforts  we could experience a loss in revenues  or a delay in receiving revenues and a delay in obtaining market acceptance for our technology 
the issuance and sale of our securities could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders 
on october   we issued and sold an aggregate of  shares of our series a preferred stock and granted the purchaser of such shares a warrant  exercisable at any time until december   to purchase an additional  shares of our series a preferred stock at per share 
under specified circumstances  the purchaser is required to exercise the preferred stock warrant 
each share of our series a preferred stock is currently convertible into ten shares of our common stock 
consequently  assuming the exercise of the preferred stock warrant  on an as converted basis  an aggregate of  shares of our common stock may be issued to the series a purchaser 
any issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of shares of our series a preferred stock could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders  as well as the interests of holders of our outstanding options and warrants which  as of december   are exercisable for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  assuming they elect to exercise such securities 
moreover  any sale of the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the series a preferred stock  as well as any of the  outstanding shares of our restricted common stock or any shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of options or warrants  into the public market could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock 
in acquisition transactions  in financing transactions  for compensatory purposes or in other types of transactions  additional issuances of equity securities could dilute the interests of our current and future stockholders 
our redemption obligations under our series a preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
under the terms of our series a preferred stock  we are required  unless the holders of at least of our outstanding series a preferred stock elect otherwise  to redeem all then outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock if one or more of the following events occurs our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  we issues shares of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock  with a purchase price of less than per share  other than in limited circumstances  we breach any representation or warranty contained in the series a purchase agreement or the registration rights agreement that has a material adverse effect on the holders of our series a preferred stock  we breach any covenant or fail to perform any of our obligations under the series a purchase agreement or the registration rights agreement each entered into in connection with the sale of our series a preferred stock  that has a material adverse effect on the holders of our series a preferred stock  an involuntary case is commenced against us under any bankruptcy  insolvency or other similar law or we commence a voluntary case under any bankruptcy  insolvency or other similar law or consent to any receivership  liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors  we default under any agreement entered into on or after october  under which we have incurred indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of  and we  prior to october   liquidate  dissolve or wind up  transfer all or substantially all of our assets or are party to a merger or other change in control transaction in which our stockholders do not own a majority of our outstanding voting securities after such transaction 
if we are required to redeem our series a preferred stock due to any of the foregoing events  we are required to pay each holder of our series a preferred stock the original purchase price  plus an amount equal to the dividends that would otherwise have accrued and been payable on such shares through october  that have not otherwise been paid as of the redemption date 
as of december   the aggregate redemption price we would be required to pay is approximately  in addition  the holders of at least of the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock may elect to require us to redeem all outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock for the original purchase price  plus all accrued but unpaid dividends as of the redemption date  on either october   october  or october  a redemption of the series a preferred stock would reduce the cash we have available to fund operations  research and product development  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
in addition  we have incurred net losses in the past and expect to incur losses in the future  which may impair our ability to generate the cash required to meet our obligations under our series a preferred stock 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations  we may be required to incur additional indebtedness or raise additional capital  which may negatively impact our stockholders 
the purchaser of our series a preferred stock owns a substantial portion of our capital stock  which may afford the purchaser significant influence over our affairs 
as of december   the purchaser of our series a preferred stock held or had the right to acquire of our outstanding common stock assuming the exercise of the series a warrant  the conversion of series a preferred stock to common stock  including shares of our common stock which the purchaser previously purchased in the open market  which represents approximately of the aggregate voting power of our stockholders on an as converted basis 
the purchaser of our series a preferred stock currently has the right to vote of our outstanding common stock on an as converted to common stock basis  assuming no exercise of the series a warrant  based on the number of shares of our capital stock outstanding as of march  
as a result  this stockholder has significant influence over any change in control of the company that may be favored by other stockholders and could otherwise exercise significant influence over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the approval of some mergers and other significant corporate transactions  such as a sale of substantially all of our assets or the defeat of any non negotiated takeover attempt that might otherwise benefit the public stockholders 
consequently  this stockholder may approve a transaction that in its judgment enhances the value of its investment  but which nonetheless may diverge from the interests of our other stockholders 
the agreements and instruments governing the rights and preferences of our series a preferred stock impose restrictions on our business and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  which we refer to as our charter  and the series a purchase agreement  govern the terms of our series a preferred stock and impose significant restrictions on our business 
these restrictions may limit our ability to operate our business and to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
our charter places restrictions on our ability to  without the consent of the holders of at least of the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock alter or change the rights  preferences or privileges of our series a preferred stock  including any increase in the number of authorized shares of our series a preferred stock  incur more than  of indebtedness at any time after the preferred stock warrant has been exercised  or  of indebtedness at any time if the preferred stock warrant has not been exercised  create  incur or assume specified liens  or declare or pay dividends  redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders  other than in limited circumstances 
events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions  may affect our ability to comply with these restrictions 
in addition  the holders of our series a preferred stock have the right to participate in future capital raising transactions of the company 
the existence of this right may substantially reduce our ability to establish terms with respect to  or enter into  any financing with parties other than the series a preferred stockholder 
the terms of any additional financing we may enter into may impose constraints on our ability to operate our business as we deem appropriate 
these restrictions and covenants could limit our ability to take advantage of financings  mergers and acquisitions or other corporate opportunities  which could adversely affect our business and financial condition and your investments in our common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash equivalents and investments  all of which have maturities of less than months 
we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  liquid debt securities that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
the weighted average interest rate on marketable securities at december   was approximately 
in view of the nature and mix of our total portfolio  a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our investment portfolio as of december  on december   we had debt of approximately million consisting of borrowings outstanding under term loans 
the weighted average interest rate on this debt at december   was approximately 
a change in the interest rate would cause a corresponding increase in our annual expense of approximately
