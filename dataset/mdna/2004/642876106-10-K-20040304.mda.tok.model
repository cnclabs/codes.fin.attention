results of operations overview the company is a leading provider of a wide variety of research equipment and scientific instruments for the life sciences used to create  maintain and control the physical and biochemical conditions required for the growth  detection and storage of microorganisms 
the company s product offerings include fermentation equipment bioreactors biological shakers ultra low temperature freezers co incubators nutrient sterilizing and dispensing equipment tissue culture apparatus air samplers the company s products are used for medical  biological  chemical and environmental research and for the commercial development of antibiotics  proteins  hormones  enzymes  monoclonal antibodies  agricultural products  fuels  vitamins  vaccines and other substances 
the company sells its equipment to pharmaceutical companies  agricultural and chemical companies  other industrial customers engaged in biotechnology  and to medical schools  universities  research institutes  hospitals  private laboratories and laboratories of federal  state and municipal government departments and agencies in the united states 
while only a small percentage of the company s sales are made directly to united states government departments and agencies  its domestic business is significantly affected by government expenditures and grants for research to educational research institutions and to industry 
the company also sells its equipment both directly primarily in western europe and through scientific equipment dealers to foreign companies  institutions and governments 
foreign sales may be affected by us export control regulations applicable to scientific equipment 
fisher scientific is the exclusive us distributor of the company s c line and i series biological shakers 
fisher scientific is also the exclusive distributor for the company s c line shakers in certain european countries and has a broader distribution arrangement with the company in canada and in france

   backlog ending 
   net sales declined during as compared with net sales  however  the decline in orders in was since net sales in were bolstered by a significant reduction in backlog of  while net sales in were negatively affected by a  increase in backlog 
the increase in backlog in resulted from increased orders late in the year for the company s new sterilizable in place fermentors  which require up to four months to manufacture as well as other fermentation products and new innova incubator shakers 
the reduction in backlog in was the result of improvements in manufacturing efficiencies allowing the company to substantially decrease average lead times 
the major areas of decline in in net sales were in biological shakers with a decrease of in sales to fisher scientific accounting for a significant portion of the decline fisher s sales of the company s products to its customers declined but they substantially reduced their inventory of the company s products during  and a decrease of in sales of cell culture equipment 
all of the company s operating units experienced lower sales during due to the lingering weakness in demand for life science equipment both in the united states and in our export markets as a result of tight government funding  reduced capital spending by pharmaceutical companies and by significantly reduced spending by biotechnology companies due to their difficulty in raising capital 
however  towards the latter part of biotech funding once again became available and capital spending by both industry and government picked up resulting in a relatively strong fourth quarter for the company both in shipments and in orders 
the decrease in net sales in as compared with is due to the absence of sales of fully custom engineered bioprocess equipment  which amounted to  in  for which the company ceased accepting orders after june  and  of antyra  inc revenues which was not consolidated after june

the declines primarily involved biological shakers and cell culture equipment 
the weak economy coupled with the downturn in the life science industry and the difficulty experienced by biotechnology companies in raising capital resulted in significant reductions in capital spending by the company s customers

it should also be noted that as a result of the weak dollar  expenses of the company s european subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars at exchange rates were  higher than if exchange rates had remained at levels

d represents a contingent liability for an earnout related to the acquisition of rs biotech provided a minimum number of units of co incubators are sold 
the company believes that the payment of such additional consideration is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt and as such has recorded the amount as a liability and as additional purchase price 
cash cash and cash equivalents increased to  at december  from  at december  the  increase resulted primarily from an increase in net cash provided by operating activities of  and an increase in net cash provided by financing activities of  and a  favorable foreign currency impact on cash offset partially by net cash used in investing activities of  operating activities the overall factors primarily driving positive cash flow during were reductions in accounts receivable and inventories as well as an increase in accounts payable

rs biotech designs  develops and manufactures co incubators for laboratories 
rs biotech has a significant presence in the uk marketplace  is currently ramping up in many other countries and sells virtually no units in the united states  thereby presenting the company with a significant opportunity for growth

bank agreement the company s agreement the bank agreement with wachovia bank  national association the bank was amended on september  to temporarily ease the financial ratio requirements under the negative covenant provisions of the bank agreement as a consequence of the losses sustained by the company during the first nine months of  which if not relaxed  would have resulted in the company being in violation of the debt coverage ratio covenant of to concurrently  the company and the bank agreed to reduce the acquisition component of the line from million to million

at such time as the company meets the financial ratios that were in force prior to this amendment expected to be september  all of the terms  financial ratios as well as interest rates will revert to what they were prior to the september  amendment 
no other provisions of the bank agreement were materially amended 
during the fourth quarter of  the company  under the bank agreement  borrowed  to fund the cash portion of the rs biotech acquisition and  towards the purchase of capital equipment 
if the company continues to meet the financial ratios under the agreement  its continued ability to borrow under the bank agreement should not be impeded

critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the company s annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management considers the following policies to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with the fob terms of orders  generally when products are shipped 
the company s products are tested by its quality assurance department prior to shipment 
the company has no other obligation associated with its products once shipment has occurred except for customary warranty provisions 
historically  returns have been immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements and are projected to remain at a consistent immaterial level in the future 
the company reports all amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and includes all costs incurred for shipping and handling as cost of sales 
certain of the company s products carry limited warranties that in general do not exceed one year from sale 
the company accrues estimated product warranty costs based on historical trends at the time of sale and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the company periodically sells maintenance contracts to certain customers 
the value of such contracts is deferred and recognized into revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimate is based on managements review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
cost includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  which is generally based on discounted cash flows 
goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  is tested annually for impairment and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the company exceeds its fair value 
deferred income taxes a portion of the deferred tax assets  which have been recorded by the company  represent net operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for certain capital losses and other deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
accounts receivable the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts after considering the collectibility of balances due  the credit worthiness of the customer and its current level of business with the customer 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company will be required to apply fin r to variable interests in vies created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie 
the adoption of fin r is not expected to have any effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
recently adopted accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquistion  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
the company also records a corresponding asset  which is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january  the adoption did not have any effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuing 
statement no 
is different from eitf issue no 
in that statement no 
requires that a liability be recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity only when the liability is incurred  that is  when it meets the definition of a liability in the fasb s conceptual framework 
statement no 
also establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities 
in contrast  under eitf issue  a company recognized a liability for an exit cost when it committed to an exit plan 
statement no 
was adopted january  with no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a freestanding financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim an annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates as it seeks debt financing to make capital expenditures  potential acquisitions and invest in cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
cash equivalents and other marketable investments are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets 
at times  management might employ specific strategies  such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging to manage foreign currency or other exposures 
further  the company does not expect its market risk exposures to change in the near term 
at december   the outstanding borrowings of the company consisted primarily of fixed and variable rate long term debt  which had a carrying value of  and a fair value of approximately  assuming other factors are held constant  interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of fixed rate debt  but do not impact the carrying value  earnings or cash flows 
accordingly  assuming a hypothetical increase of in interest rates and all other variables remaining constant  interest expense would not change  however  the fair market value of the fixed rate long term debt would decrease by approximately
