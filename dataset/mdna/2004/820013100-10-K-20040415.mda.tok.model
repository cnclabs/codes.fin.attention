item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview the sharper image is a multi channel specialty retailer of innovative  high quality products that are useful and entertaining and are designed to make life easier and more enjoyable 
our unique assortment of products offers design  creativity and technological innovation  in addition to fun and entertainment 
we market and sell our merchandise primarily through three integrated sales channels the sharper image stores  the sharper image catalog  which includes revenue from all direct marketing activities and television infomercials  and the internet 
we also market to other businesses through our corporate sales  where revenues are recorded in each of our three sales channels and wholesale operations 
our total revenues increased to million in the year ended january  fiscal from million in the year ended january  fiscal 
this increase was due primarily to the popularity of our sharper image design and sharper image branded products  including our air purification line of products  the opening of net new stores  a comparable store sales increase of  and an increase in our multimedia advertising which we believe increased sales in all selling channels 
our store operations generated the highest proportion of our sales  representing and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
as of january   we operated the sharper image stores in states and the district of columbia 
as part of our growth strategy  we have opened  and the sharper image stores  and closed three  two and two stores at lease maturity  in fiscal  and  respectively 
our catalog and direct marketing operations  including revenue generated directly from catalogs  print advertising  single product mailers and television infomercials  generated and of our total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
our internet operations generated and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
one of our goals is to increase the percentage of total revenues attributable to sharper image design and sharper image branded products  which typically generate higher margins than our third party branded products 
the percentage of our total revenues attributable to sharper image design and sharper image branded products was approximately in fiscal from approximately in fiscal the popularity of third party branded products such as digital cameras and massage chairs during fiscal contributed to the lower percentage of sales coming from sharper image design and sharper image branded products 
our business is highly seasonal  with sales peaks in the end of year holiday shopping seaons as well as for mother s day  father s day and graduation gift gift giving 
a substantial portion of our total revenues  and all or most of our net earnings  occur in our fourth fiscal quarter ending january we generally experience lower revenues during the other quarters and  as is typical in the retail industry  have incurred and may continue to incur losses in these quarters 
in addition  similar to many retailers  we make merchandising and inventory decisions for the holiday season well in advance of the holiday selling season 
accordingly  unfavorable economic conditions or deviations from projected demand for products during the fourth quarter could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations for the entire fiscal year 
the fourth quarter accounted for more than of total revenues in both fiscal and in addition  the fourth quarter accounted for all of our net earnings in fiscal and substantially all of our net earnings in our financial statements for fiscal reflect certain reclassifications made to prior year financial statements in order to conform to the january  financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the carrying value of inventory  fixed asset lives  deferred cost recovery period  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on analyses of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following represents our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the point of sale at our retail stores and at the time of customer receipt for our catalog and direct marketing sales  including the internet 
we recognize revenue for sales to resellers of sales made on a wholesale basis when the products are shipped  which is the time title passes to the purchaser 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns based on our historical return rates 
revenues are recorded net of sale discounts and other rebates and incentives offered to customers 
deferred revenue represents merchandise certificates  gift cards and rewards cards outstanding and unfilled cash orders at the end of the fiscal period 
delivery revenue is recognized at the time of customer receipt 
merchandise inventories 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence on unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory writedowns may be required 
accounts receivable 
counterparties to our accounts receivable include credit card issuers  corporate marketing incentive customers  wholesale customers  installment plan customers for purchases of a limited number of products  merchandise vendors  and landlords from whom we expect to receive amounts due 
we record an allowance for credit losses based on estimates of customers ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
store closure reserves 
we record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments  anticipated future subleases of properties and current risk free interest rates 
if interest rates or the real estate leasing markets change  additional reserves may be required 
other accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with our evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets as well as those used in the determination of liabilities related to litigation  product liability  and taxation 
various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions and product mix 
we constantly re evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  we are involved in litigation incidental to our business  the disposition of which is expected to have no material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings 
we accrue our best estimates of the probable cost for the resolution of legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimates of our probable liability in these matters may change

net sales for fiscal increased million or  from the prior fiscal year 
returns and allowances for fiscal were of sales  as compared to for fiscal the increase in net sales was attributable primarily to increases in net sales from stores of million  from catalog and direct marketing of million  from internet operations of million  and from wholesale of million 
the increase in total revenue for fiscal  as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the popularity of our sharper image design and sharper image branded products  which continues to be a key factor in the increases in net sales in all selling channels 
sales of sharper image design and sharper image branded products decreased to approximately of total revenues in fiscal from approximately for fiscal the popularity of third party branded products such as digital cameras and massage chairs during fiscal contributed to the lower percentage of sales coming from sharper image design and sharper image branded products 
we believe that the continued development and introduction of new and popular products is a key strategic objective and important to our future success 
contributing to the increase in net sales was a comparable store sales increase of over fiscal and the opening of net new stores during fiscal we also believe that the increased investment in our advertising initiatives in fiscal and  which include the significant increase in television infomercial advertising and single product mailers  highlighting primarily selected sharper image design and sharper image branded products and the increase in catalogs circulated contributed to the higher revenues in all selling channels 
net store sales for fiscal increased million  or  while comparable store sales increased by from fiscal the increase in net store sales was attributable primarily to the opening of new stores during fiscal  the increased sales of sharper image design and sharper image branded products  the increase in comparable store sales  and the increased television infomercial and single product mailer advertising  partially offset by the closing of three stores at their lease maturity 
the opening of new stores  offset by the three store closures in fiscal  resulted in an incremental increase to net store sales of million from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in comparable store sales primarily resulted from a increase in total store transactions for fiscal and an increase in the average revenue per transaction  compared with fiscal the increase in average revenue per transaction was attributable primarily to the overall product mix offered  and multimedia advertising strategies  including infomercial advertising 
also contributing to the increase in average revenue per transaction are the increased sales of sharper image design and sharper image branded products  particularly our air purification products 
average net sales per square foot for fiscal for all stores increased to from in fiscal average net sales per square foot for our comparable store base for fiscal was average net sales per square foot is calculated by averaging over all stores the amount of each store s net sales divided by that store s total square footage under lease 
average revenue per transaction is calculated by dividing the amount of gross sales  exclusive of delivery revenue and sales taxes  per channel by the gross number of transactions in that channel 
comparable store sales is not a measure that has been defined under generally accepted accounting principles 
we define comparable store sales as sales from stores where selling square feet did not change by more than in the previous months and which have been open for at least months 
a store opened on or prior to the th of a month is treated as open for the entire month 
stores generally become comparable once they have months of comparable sales for our annual calculation 
we believe that comparable store sales  which excludes the effect of a change in the number of stores open  provides a more useful measure of the performance of our store sales channel than does the absolute change in aggregate net store sales 
net catalog and direct marketing sales  which includes direct sales generated from catalog mailings  single product mailers  print advertising and television infomercials  for fiscal increased million or  from fiscal this increase was due primarily to a increase in television infomercial advertising expense  a increase in single product mailers circulated  and a increase in the sharper image catalog pages circulated  which includes a increase in the sharper image catalogs circulated 
the increase in net catalog and direct marketing sales for fiscal reflects a increase in transactions and a decrease of in average revenue per transaction  compared to fiscal for fiscal and  and of the net catalog and direct marketing sales were generated from television infomercial direct sales 
we intend to continue our aggressive multimedia advertising programs during fiscal to attract new customers  while achieving a favorable return on advertising investment 
our goal is to achieve direct response sales resulting in near breakeven results on all direct marketing advertising initiatives 
we continually review our advertising initiatives  including the pages and number of catalogs and single product mailers circulated  and the amount of and return on investment from television infomercial advertising  in our efforts to improve revenues from catalog and direct marketing advertising 
net internet sales from our sharperimage 
com web site  which includes the sharper image and ebay auction sites  in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal this increase was attributable primarily to a increase in internet advertising which includes paid for search engine key word placement and revenue share costs incurred for affiliate programs  a increase in internet transactions and a increase in average revenue per transaction 
during fiscal  our web site enhancements included the launch of our online gift registry  customer service site contents and navigation bar enhancements to highlight our online outlet store 
we have also continued to improve the speed and efficiency of the processing and hardware capabilities 
net wholesale sales for fiscal year increased million  or  compared to fiscal the increase is attributable primarily due to increasing sharper image design product sales to our existing wholesale customer base and to test programs with new wholesale customers 
we believe that the wholesale business  pursued with select partners  will continue to strengthen our brand name and broaden our customer base 
cost of products 
cost of products for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal this increase is due primarily to the higher sales volume  partially offset by the lower relative cost of products for our sharper image design and sharper image branded products 
the gross margin rate for fiscal was  or percentage points higher  than the fiscal rate of 
the gross margin rate was adversely affected by delivery expense of million in excess of delivery income collected of million due primarily to the increase in single product mailers which offered free shipping when an order is placed and free shipping given on infomercial orders when a customer elects a single payment plan 
our gross margin rate fluctuates with changes in our merchandise mix  primarily sharper image design and sharper image branded products  which changes as we make new items available in various categories or introduce new proprietary products 
the variation in merchandise mix from category to category from year to year is characteristic of our sales results being driven by individual products rather than by general product lines 
additionally  the auction sites and other selected promotional activities  such as free shipping offers  in part  tend to offset the rate of increase in our gross margin rate 
our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other retailers  since some retailers include the costs related to their distribution network in cost of products while we  and other retailers  exclude them from gross margin and include them instead in general  selling and administrative expenses 
we cannot accurately predict future gross margin rates  although our goal is to continue to increase sales of sharper image design and sharper image branded products to capitalize on the higher margins realized on these products 
buying and occupancy 
buying and occupancy costs for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal this increase reflects a full year of occupancy costs for the new stores opened in fiscal  the occupancy costs associated with the new stores opened in fiscal and rent increases for some existing store locations  partially offset by five stores closed at lease maturity during fiscal and buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in fiscal from for fiscal in fiscal  we opened a total of new stores  exceeding our goal of a increase in the number of stores opened on an annual basis 
our goal is to continue to increase new store openings by in fiscal but we cannot assure you we will achieve this goal 
advertising 
advertising expenses for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in advertising expense was attributable primarily to a increase in television infomercial advertising expense and a increase in internet advertising  which includes search engine key word placement and revenue share costs incurred for affiliate programs 
also contributing to the increase in advertising is a increase in the number of single product mailers circulated and a increase in the number of sharper image catalog pages circulated  which includes a increase in the number of sharper image catalogs circulated 
during fiscal  we continued our other multimedia advertising initiatives  which included radio  television and print advertising  among others 
although we believe these initiatives contributed to the increase in sales in the stores  catalog and direct marketing and internet channels  there can be no assurance of the continued success of these advertising initiatives 
during fiscal  we increased the circulation of our single product mailer  which highlights our most popular sharper image design products 
we believe that the single product mailer will continue to extend our brand name by prospecting to future sharper image customers  at a reduced cost in comparison to mailing a sharper image catalog 
we also increased our television media spending on infomercials highlighting selected sharper image design and sharper image branded products and expanded our multimedia advertising initiatives of various print ads and radio 
advertising expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained constant at for fiscal and fiscal although there is a declining marginal benefit obtained by increasing advertising expenditures  we monitor the effectiveness of our advertising in order to achieve a reasonable overall return on our investment in advertising 
we believe that expansion of all our advertising initiatives contributed to the sales increases for fiscal and increased brand awareness 
our advertising strategy will continue to be an important factor in our future revenue growth and as a result  we expect advertising costs to be higher in fiscal than in fiscal general  selling and administrative 
general  selling and administrative  or gs a  expenses for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal contributing to this increase was an increase of million due primarily to variable expenses from increased net sales  which includes million due to variable expenses from increased sales from all sales channels and million due to variable expenses from increased sales and selling expenses related to the new stores opened in fiscal also contributing to the increase were increases of million for health care and insurance  million for distribution center shipping costs incurred for product delivery to our stores  and million related to professional fees 
gs a expenses for fiscal decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from in fiscal due to better leverage of fixed costs on an expanding sales base 
gs a costs were controlled as a result of our continual review of gs a expenses and infrastructure 
other income expense the increase in other income is primarily due to the interest income earned on higher investment balances generated from the proceeds from our public stock offering and improved operating results  offset by the write off of fixed assets for store locations remodeled prior to the expiration of their existing lease 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal and income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events then known to us are considered  other than changes in the tax law or rates

contributing to the increase in net sales was a comparable store sales increase of over fiscal and the opening of net new stores during fiscal we also believe that the increased investment in our advertising initiatives in fiscal and  including the significant increase in television infomercial advertising and single product mailers  highlighting primarily selected sharper image design and sharper image branded products  contributed to the higher revenues in all selling channels 
we believe that fiscal revenues were adversely affected by the onset of the economic recession  the events of september  and subsequent anthrax scare  and a faster than expected end to the razor scooter fad which drove exceptional sales volumes in fiscal net store sales for fiscal increased million  or  while comparable store sales increased by from fiscal the increase in net store sales was attributable primarily to the opening of new new stores during fiscal  the increased sales of sharper image design and sharper image branded products  the increase in comparable store sales  and the increased television infomercial and single product mailer advertising  partially offset by the closing of two stores at lease maturity 
the opening of net new stores resulted in an incremental increase to net store sales of million from the prior fiscal year 
total store transactions for fiscal increased and average revenue per transaction increased  compared with fiscal the increase in average revenue per transaction was attributable primarily to the overall product mix offered  multimedia advertising strategies  including infomercial advertising which highlighted products with retail prices which are higher than our average in the prior year  and the increased sales of sharper image design and sharper image branded products  particularly our air purification products 
average net sales per square foot for fiscal increased to from in fiscal average net sales per square foot is calculated by averaging over all stores the amount of each store s net sales divided by that store s square footage under lease

com web site  which includes the sharper image auction site  in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal this increase was attributable primarily to a increase in internet advertising  a increase in internet transactions and a increase in average revenue per transaction 
excluding auction sales for these periods  net internet sales increased  transactions increased and average revenue per transaction increased 
we believe the decrease in auction sales for fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable primarily to our decision to raise bid prices during late fiscal and to reduce the number of products offered on our auction site  which resulted in an improved gross margin rate and gross margin dollars from auctions 
we continue to utilize the auction site to increase our internet business  broaden our customer base and manage inventories  including closeouts  repackaged and reconditioned items 
net wholesale sales for fiscal year increased million  or  compared to fiscal the increase is attributable primarily to a strategic wholesale marketing arrangement we tested with circuit city stores 
the arrangement with circuit city stores initially allowed for the showcase and testing of a select assortment of sharper image design and sharper image branded products on large dedicated fixtures in over circuit city superstores 
we will continue to evaluate this wholesale marketing arrangement in fiscal cost of products 
cost of products for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal this increase is due primarily to the higher sales volume  partially offset by the lower relative cost of products for our sharper image design and sharper image branded products 
the gross margin rate for fiscal was  or percentage points higher  than the fiscal rate of 
this increase was due primarily to increased sales of sharper image design and sharper image branded products  which generally carry higher margins than third party branded products 
sharper image design and sharper image branded products as a percentage of total revenues  exclusive of net wholesale sales  increased to approximately for fiscal  as compared to approximately for fiscal we believe that our gross margin for fiscal was negatively affected by the labor dispute between the pacific maritime association  or pma  and the international longshore and warehouse union  or ilwu  whose members are primarily responsible for the removal of cargo from container loaded shipping vessels in west coast us ports 
in response to the day lockout by the pma in october and drop in productivity during the subsequent months  we increased usage of airfreight transportation  which adversely affected our gross margins for the third and to a greater extent the fourth quarters of fiscal buying and occupancy

during fiscal  we continued our other multimedia advertising initiatives  which included radio  television and print advertising  among others 
the higher cost of postage on various direct marketing mailers  including the catalog and single product mailers  contributed to advertising cost increases although these increases were partially offset by the savings from lower paper costs during fiscal advertising expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal general  selling and administrative 
general  selling and administrative  or gs a  expenses for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal contributing to this increase was an increase of million due primarily to variable expenses from increased net sales and selling expenses related to the new stores opened during fiscal  and the annualized selling expenses related to the stores opened in fiscal  partially offset by the reduced selling expenses of two stores closed at lease maturity during fiscal also contributing to the increase were increases of million for distribution shipping costs incurred for product delivery to our stores which primarily reflects additional airfreight costs incurred in connection with the west coast port strike  million related to technological system enhancements made in our operational areas and million due to increases in health benefits and company wide insurance premiums 
gs a expenses for fiscal decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from in fiscal the decline in the gs a percentage is the result of our continual review of gs a expenses and infrastructure combined with better leverage of fixed costs on an expanding sales base 
other income expense the decrease in other income is due to a reduction in the interest rate earned on invested balances  an increase in interest expense incurred on the early payoff of our mortgage loan  partially offset by a reduction in losses on the disposal of assets 
liquidity and capital resources we met our short term liquidity needs and our capital requirements during fiscal with cash generated from operations  trade credits  existing cash balances and proceeds from a public offering of our common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the fiscal net cash provided by operating activities decreased million compared to fiscal  is due primarily to the increased merchandise inventory levels required as a result of the new stores opened during fiscal  the timing of the receipt of imported products due to chinese new years when many factories overseas close for up to three weeks  and the inventory we believe necessary to sustain our current sales growth trends 
the comparable decrease was also due to the increase in accounts receivable balances and decreases in accounts payable 
partially offsetting the comparable decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was the increase in net earnings from fiscal over net cash used in investing activities  primarily capital expenditures for new and remodeled stores  technological enhancements  tooling costs for sharper image design products and the expansion of our distribution facilities totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  we opened new stores and remodeled six stores 
in fiscal  we opened new stores and remodeled six stores

on october   we terminated our secured credit facility and entered into a new revolving secured credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association 
the new credit facility has a maturity date of october   and will allow borrowings and letters of credit up to a maximum of million at all times during the year  with a borrowing base determined by inventory levels and specified accounts receivable 
the new credit facility is secured by our inventory  accounts receivable  accounts and specified other assets 
borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at either the adjusted libor rate plus or at wells fargo s prime rate less 
the new credit facility contains financial covenants that only apply during an event of default or when the borrowing base falls below a specified level 
these financial covenants require us to maintain a minimum ebitda as defined of million and to maintain capital expenditures below a specified level based on our projections 
the new credit facility contains limitations on incurring additional indebtedness  making additional investments and permitting a change of control 
as of january   letter of credit commitments outstanding under the new credit facility were million  which includes a million backstop letter of credit to cover credit commitments outstanding under our old secured credit facility

we plan to continue our capital investment in tooling costs for proprietary products and to further expand our infrastructure through exercising our lease options to increase our distribution center capabilities and continue our enhancement of our technological systems 
we believe that our total capital expenditures for fiscal will be approximately million to million 
absent unfavorable economic conditions or deviations from projected demand for our products  particularly during the fourth quarter  we expect to achieve positive cash flow from operations on an annual basis  although we likely will need to finance holiday and new store increases in inventories through trade credits and our credit facility 
we believe we will be able to fund our capital expenditures for new and remodeled stores  technological enhancements and tooling costs for sharper image design products through existing cash balances  cash generated from operations  trade credits  and  as necessary  our credit facility
