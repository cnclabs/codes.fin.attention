item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
executive summary of consolidated results of operations year ended december  in millions  except per share data net income attributed to utility group nonregulated group corporate other basic earnings per share attributed to utility group nonregulated group corporate other results for the year ended december   net income decreased million  or per share  when compared to the decline in earnings was principally due to the utility group s results which decreased million  offset by increased earnings of million from the nonregulated group 
the decrease in earnings per share of also reflects the impact of additional common shares outstanding resulting from an equity offering of approximately million shares during the offering netted proceeds of approximately million 
the additional shares had the effect of reducing earnings per share as compared to by approximately 
the increase in nonregulated group earnings is due to increased earnings from the energy marketing and services and coal mining groups and a net gain recognized from business and investment divestitures 
the decrease in utility group earnings was primarily due to increased operating expenses and the write off of investments  partially offset by increased wholesale power margins and retail electric rate recovery related to nox compliance expenditures and related operating expenses 
in  consolidated net income increased million  or per share  when compared to the year ended december   included nonrecurring merger  integration  and restructuring costs and other nonrecurring items totaling million after tax  or per share 
the increase also reflects improved utility group margins and lower operating costs 
these resulted from favorable weather and lower gas prices and the related reduction in costs incurred in also contributing to the increase was increased nonregulated group earnings from gas marketing operations 
the utility group generates revenue primarily from the delivery of natural gas and electric service to its customers 
the primary source of cash flow for the utility group results from the collection of customer bills and the payment for goods and services procured for the delivery of gas and electric services 
the results of the utility group are impacted by weather patterns in its service territory and general economic conditions both in its service territory as well as nationally 
the nonregulated group generates revenue or earnings from the provision of services to customers 
the activities of the nonregulated group are closely linked to the utility industry  and the results of those operations are generally impacted by factors similar to those impacting the overall utility industry 
the company has in place a disclosure committee that consists of senior management as well as financial management 
the committee is actively involved in the preparation and review of the company s sec filings 
dividends dividends declared for the year ended december   were per share compared to per share in and per share in in october  the company s board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to per share from per share 
nonrecurring items in merger integration costs merger and integration related costs incurred during totaled million 
these costs relate primarily to transaction costs  severance  and other merger and acquisition integration activities 
as a result of merger and integration activities  management retired certain information systems in accordingly  the useful lives of these assets were shortened to reflect this decision  resulting in additional depreciation expense of approximately million for the year ended december  in total  merger and integration related costs incurred during were million million after tax  or per share 
merger and integration activities resulting from the merger forming vectren were completed in restructuring costs as part of continued cost saving efforts  in june  the company s management and board of directors approved a plan to restructure  primarily  its regulated operations 
the restructuring plan included the elimination of certain administrative and supervisory positions in its utility operations and corporate office 
charges of million were expensed in june as a direct result of the restructuring plan 
additional charges of million were incurred during the remainder of primarily for consulting fees  employee relocation  and duplicate facilities costs 
in total  the company incurred restructuring charges of million million after tax  or per share  in these charges were comprised of million for employee severance  related benefits and other employee related costs  million for lease termination fees related to duplicate facilities and other facility costs  and million for consulting and other fees incurred through december  the restructuring program was completed during  except for the departure of certain employees impacted by the restructuring which occurred during and the final settlement of the lease obligation which has yet to occur 
extraordinary loss in june  the company sold certain leveraged lease investments with a net book value of million at a loss of million million after tax  or per share 
because of the transaction s significance and because the transaction occurred within two years of the effective date of the merger of indiana energy and sigcorp  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests  apb requires the loss on disposition of these investments to be treated as extraordinary 
proceeds from the sale of million were used to retire short term borrowings 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of sfas  certain contracts in the power marketing operations and gas marketing operations that are periodically settled net were required to be recorded at market value 
previously  the company accounted for these contracts on settlement 
the cumulative impact of the adoption of sfas resulting from marking these contracts to market on january   was an earnings gain of approximately million million after tax  or per share  recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated statements of income 
the majority of this gain results from the company s power marketing operations 
detailed discussion of results of operations following is a more detailed discussion of the results of operations of the company s utility group and nonregulated group 
the detailed results of operations for the utility group and nonregulated group are presented and analyzed before the reclassification and elimination of certain intersegment transactions necessary to consolidate those results into the company s consolidated statements of income 
the operations of the corporate and other group are not significant 
results of operations of the utility group the utility group is comprised of vectren utility holdings  inc s operations  which consist of the company s regulated operations the gas utility services and electric utility services operating segments  and other operations that provide information technology and other support services to those regulated operations 
gas utility services provides natural gas distribution and transportation services in nearly two thirds of indiana and to west central ohio 
electric utility services provides electricity primarily to southwestern indiana  and includes the company s power generating and marketing operations 
the results of operations of the utility group before certain intersegment eliminations and reclassifications for the years ended december    and  follow year ended december  in millions  except per share data operating revenues gas utility   electric utility other total operating revenues    operating expenses cost of gas sold fuel for electric generation purchased electric energy other operating merger integration costs restructuring costs depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total operating expenses    operating income other income expense other net equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates total other income interest expense income before income taxes income taxes preferred dividend requirement of subsidiary income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net of tax net income basic earnings per share in  utility group earnings were million as compared to million in and million in the million decrease occurring in compared to was primarily due to increased operating expenses and the write off of investments  partially offset by increased wholesale power margins and retail electric rate recovery related to nox compliance expenditures and related operating expenses 
utility group earnings increased million in compared to the year ended december   included nonrecurring merger  integration  and restructuring costs and other nonrecurring items totaling million after tax 
the increase also reflects improved margins and lower operating costs 
these resulted from favorable weather and lower gas prices and the related reduction in costs incurred in weather increased utility earnings by an estimated million 
throughout this discussion  the terms gas utility margin and electric utility margin are used 
gas utility margin and electric utility margin could be considered non gaap measures of income 
gas utility margin is calculated as gas utility revenues less the cost of gas sold 
electric utility margin is calculated as electric utility revenues less fuel for electric generation and purchased electric energy 
these measures exclude other operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  taxes other than income taxes  merger and integration costs  and restructuring costs  which are included in the calculation of operating income 
the company believes gas utility and electric utility margins are better indicators of relative contribution than revenues since gas prices and fuel costs can be volatile and are generally collected on a dollar for dollar basis from customers 
margins should not be considered an alternative to  or a more meaningful indicator of operating performance than  operating income or net income as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
significant fluctuations utility group margin margin generated from the sale of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers is seasonal and impacted by weather patterns in its service territory 
margin generated from sales to industrial and other contract customers is impacted by overall economic conditions 
in general  margin is not sensitive to variations in gas or fuel costs 
it is  however  impacted by the collection of state mandated taxes which fluctuate with gas costs and also some level of fluctuation in volumes sold 
electric generating asset optimization activities are primarily affected by market conditions  the level of excess generating capacity  and electric transmission availability 
following is a discussion and analysis of margin generated from regulated utility operations 
gas utility margin gas utility revenues less cost of gas sold gas utility margin and throughput by customer type follows year ended december  in millions residential commercial contract other total gas utility margin sold transported volumes in mmdth to residential commercial customers to contract customers total throughput gas utility margin for the year ended december   of million increased million  or  compared to it is estimated that weather near normal for the year and cooler than the prior year  contributed million in increased residential and commercial margin and was the primary contributor to increased throughput 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to million in higher utility receipts and excise taxes on higher gas costs and volumes sold and million in recovery of ohio customer choice implementation costs 
these increases are partially offset by the negative effect of high gas prices on customer usage 
gas utility margin for the year ended december   of million increased million  or  compared to the increase is primarily due to weather cooler for the year and cooler in the fourth quarter 
rate recovery of excise taxes in ohio effective july   an increase in the percent of income payment plan rider affecting ohio customers  decreased gas costs  and customer growth of over one percent also contributed 
it is estimated that weather contributed million to the increase in gas utility margin  various rate recovery riders in ohio contributed million  and other items  including the impact of lower gas costs and customer growth  contributed million 
the effect of cooler weather was the primary factor driving an overall increase in total throughput 
as noted above  gas cost fluctuations have impacted customer usage during the years ended december    and the average cost per dekatherm of gas purchased in those years was in  in  and in electric utility margin electric utility revenues less fuel for electric generation and purchased electric energy electric utility margin by revenue type follows year ended december  in millions residential commercial industrial municipalities other total retail firm wholesale asset optimization total electric utility margin retail firm wholesale margin for the year ended december   margin from serving native load and firm wholesale customers was million  a decrease of million when compared to it is estimated that summer weather cooler than normal and cooler than last year caused an million decrease in residential and commercial margin 
the estimated effect of weather was partially offset by a million increase in retail electric rates related to recovery of nox compliance expenditures and related operating expenses 
a slowly recovering economy continued to negatively impact industrial sales which decreased million compared to as a result primarily of the mild weather and slow economic conditions  retail and firm wholesale volumes sold decreased to gwh in compared to gwh in volumes sold in were gwh 
the current year decrease in native load and firm wholesale margin has been offset by increased optimization margin as more fully described below 
for the year ended december   margin from serving native load and firm wholesale customers increased million or  when compared to the increase results primarily from the effect on residential and commercial sales of cooling weather considerably warmer than the prior year 
weather in was warmer than and warmer than normal 
in addition to weather  was positively affected by increased industrial and other wholesale volumes and rate recovery related to nox compliance expenditures as the expenditures are made pursuant to a rate recovery rider approved by the iurc in august as a result of warmer weather and increased volumes sold  native load and firm wholesale volumes sold increased 
it is estimated that weather contributed million to the increase in electric utility margin  and the increased industrial and other wholesale volumes and the nox recovery rider contributed million 
margin from asset optimization activities periodically  generation capacity is in excess of that needed to serve native load and firm wholesale customers 
the company markets this unutilized capacity to optimize the return on its owned generation assets 
substantially all of these contracts are integrated with portfolio requirements around power supply and delivery and are short term purchase and sale transactions that expose the company to limited market risk 
following is a reconciliation of asset optimization activity year ended december  in millions beginning of year net asset optimization position statement of income activity cumulative effect at adoption of sfas mark to market gains losses recognized realized gains recognized net activity in electric utility margin net cash received other adjustments end of year net asset optimization position included in prepayments other current assets accrued liabilities for the years ended december    and  volumes sold into the wholesale market were gwh  gwh  and gwh respectively  while volumes purchased were gwh in  gwh in  and gwh in a portion of volumes purchased in the wholesale market is used to serve native load and firm wholesale customers  and in  greater amounts of purchased power have been required for native load due to scheduled outages  which has reduced capacity available for optimization 
additionally  volumes sold and purchased were lower in compared to due to a shorter term focus in hedging and optimization strategies 
while volumes both sold and purchased in the wholesale market have decreased during  margin from optimization activities has increased compared to due primarily to price volatility 
despite the increased volumes in  margins were lower in compared to due to reduced price volatility 
in july  the eitf released eitf  reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement no 
and not held for trading purposes as defined in issue no 
eitf 
eitf states that determining whether realized gains and losses on physically settled derivative contracts should be reported in the statement of income on a gross or net basis is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances 
the eitf contains a presumption that net settled derivative contracts should be reported net in the statement of income 
the company adopted eitf as required on october  after considering the facts and circumstances relevant to the asset optimization portfolio  the company believes presentation of these optimization activities on a net basis is appropriate and has reclassified purchase contracts and mark to market activity related to optimization activities from purchased electric energy to electric utility revenues 
prior year financial information has also been reclassified to conform to this net presentation 
following is information regarding asset optimization activities included in electric utility revenues and fuel for electric generation in the statements of income 
year ended december  in millions activity related to sales contracts purchase contracts mark to market gains losses net asset optimization revenue fuel for electric generation asset optimization margin utility group operating expenses other operating for the year ended december   other operating expenses increased million compared to the increase is principally caused by increased distribution  plant  and transmission operating expenses  power plant and other maintenance  customer service initiatives  higher insurance premiums  and prior year insurance recoveries 
in addition  operating expenses reflect million in amortization of ohio choice implementation costs  which are recovered through increased gas utility margin 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by the impact of an ohio regulatory order 
the order allows the deferral and recovery of uncollectible accounts expense to the extent it differs from the level included in base rates 
the company estimated the difference to approximate million in excess of that included in base rates in other operating expenses decreased million for the year ended december   when compared to the decrease results primarily from lower gas prices and the related reduction in costs incurred in specific expenses affected by increased gas costs in were uncollectible accounts expense of million and contributions to low income heating assistance programs of million 
insurance recovery in of million of certain maintenance costs incurred in also contributed to the decrease 
depreciation amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization increased million compared to due to additions to utility plant 
increased depreciation expense reflects depreciation of utility plant placed into service including a full year for a gas fired peaker unit  expenditures for implementing a choice program for ohio gas customers  customer system upgrades  and other upgrades to existing transmission and distribution facilities 
depreciation and amortization decreased million for the year ended december   when compared to the decrease results from million of expense recognized in related to assets which had useful lives shortened as a result of the merger 
the discontinuance of goodwill amortization as required by sfas  which approximated million in  also contributed to the decrease 
these decreases were offset somewhat by depreciation of utility plant and non utility property additions 
taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased million in compared to higher utility receipts and excise taxes of million were recognized in due to higher gas prices and more volumes sold compared to the remaining increase results principally from higher property taxes 
taxes other than income taxes decreased million in compared to as a result of lower revenues subject to the indiana utility receipts tax 
utility group other income expense net other net other net decreased million in compared to and increased million in compared to the decrease is primarily due to the million write off of notes receivable and preferred equity investments in babb international babb  an entity that processed fly ash into building materials 
the increase results primarily from gains recognized from the sale of excess emission allowances and other assets 
equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates increased million in compared to principally due to increased losses and increased preferred ownership in babb 
the smaller loss recognized in results from the write off of the babb investment 
utility group interest expense interest expense decreased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to the decrease reflects the impact of permanent financing completed in the third quarter of lower average interest rates on adjustable rate debt also contributed to the decreases in and utility group income taxes for the year ended december   federal and state income taxes increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to the increase results primarily from an increased effective tax rate that reflects an increase in the indiana state income tax rate from to and other changes in the effective tax rate recognized in the increase in compared to is principally due to higher pre tax earnings 
competition the utility industry has undergone dramatic structural change for several years  resulting in increasing competitive pressures faced by electric and gas utility companies 
currently  several states  including ohio  have passed legislation allowing electricity customers to choose their electricity supplier in a competitive electricity market and several other states are considering such legislation 
at the present time  indiana has not adopted such legislation 
ohio regulation allows gas customers to choose their commodity supplier 
the company implemented a choice program for its gas customers in ohio in january indiana has not adopted any regulation requiring gas choice  however  the company operates under approved tariffs permitting large volume customers to choose their commodity supplier 
other operating matters the ferc approved the midwest independent system operator miso as the nation s first regional transmission organization 
regional transmission organizations place public utility transmission facilities in a region under common control 
the miso is committed to reliability  the nondiscriminatory operation of the bulk power transmission system  and to working with all stakeholders to create cost effective and innovative solutions 
the carmel  indiana  based miso began operations in december and serves the electrical transmission needs of much of the midwest 
in december  the iurc approved the company s request for authority to transfer operational control over its electric transmission facilities to the miso 
that transfer occurred on february  issues pertaining to certain of miso s tariff charges for its services remain to be determined by the ferc 
given the outstanding tariff issues  as well as the potential for additional growth in miso participation  the company is unable to determine the future impact miso participation may have on its operations 
pursuant to an order from the iurc  certain miso costs are deferred for future recovery 
as a result of miso s operational control over much of the midwestern electric transmission grid  including sigeco s transmission facilities  sigeco s continued ability to import power  when necessary  and export power to the wholesale market may be impacted 
given the nature of miso s policies regarding use of transmission facilities  as well as ongoing ferc initiatives  it is difficult to predict the impact on operational reliability 
the potential need to expend capital for improvements to the transmission system  both to sigeco s facilities as well as to those facilities of adjacent utilities  over the next several years will become more predictable as miso completes studies related to regional transmission planning and improvements 
such expenditures may be significant 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  and local regulations with respect to environmental matters  principally air  solid waste  and water quality 
pursuant to environmental regulations  the company is required to obtain operating permits for the electric generating plants that it owns or operates and construction permits for any new plants it might propose to build 
regulations concerning air quality establish standards with respect to both ambient air quality and emissions from electric generating facilities  including particulate matter  sulfur dioxide so  and nitrogen oxide nox 
regulations concerning water quality establish standards relating to intake and discharge of water from electric generating facilities  including water used for cooling purposes in electric generating facilities 
because of the scope and complexity of these regulations  the company is unable to predict the ultimate effect of such regulations on its future operations  nor is it possible to predict what other regulations may be adopted in the future 
the company intends to comply with all applicable governmental regulations  but will contest any regulation it deems to be unreasonable or impossible with which to comply 
clean air act nox sip call matter the clean air act the act requires each state to adopt a state implementation plan sip to attain and maintain national ambient air quality standards naaqs for a number of pollutants  including ozone 
if the usepa finds a state s sip inadequate to achieve the naaqs  the usepa can call upon the state to revise its sip a sip call 
in october  the usepa issued a final rule finding of significant contribution and rulemaking for certain states in the ozone transport assessment group region for purposes of reducing regional transport of ozone  fed 
reg 

this ruling found that the sip s of certain states  including indiana  were substantially inadequate since they allowed for nox emissions in amounts that contributed to non attainment with the ozone naaqs in downwind states 
the usepa required each state to revise its sip to provide for further nox emission reductions 
the nox emissions budget  as stipulated in the usepa s final ruling  requires a reduction in total nox emissions from indiana 
in june  the indiana air pollution control board adopted final rules to achieve the nox emission reductions required by the nox sip call 
indiana s sip requires the company to lower its system wide nox emissions to 
lbs 
mmbtu by may   the compliance date 
this is a reduction in emission levels 
the company has initiated steps toward compliance with the revised regulations 
these steps include installing selective catalytic reduction scr systems at culley generating station unit culley  warrick generating station unit  and ab brown generating station units and scr systems reduce flue gas nox emissions to atmospheric nitrogen and water using ammonia in a chemical reaction 
this technology is known to currently be the most effective method of reducing nox emissions where high removal efficiencies are required 
the iurc has issued orders that approve o the company s project to achieve environmental compliance by investing in clean coal technology  o a total capital cost investment for this project up to million excluding afudc  subject to periodic review of the actual costs incurred  o a mechanism whereby  prior to an electric base rate case  the company may recover through a rider that is updated every six months  an percent return on its weighted capital costs for the project  and o ongoing recovery of operating costs  including depreciation and purchased emission allowances through a rider mechanism  related to the clean coal technology once the facility is placed into service 
based on the level of system wide emissions reductions required and the control technology utilized to achieve the reductions  the current estimated clean coal technology construction cost is consistent with amounts approved in the iurc s orders and is expected to be expended during the period 
through december   million has been expended 
after the equipment is installed and operational  related annual operating expenses  including depreciation expense  are estimated to be between million and million 
a portion of those expenses began in october when the culley scr became operational 
the percent return on capital investment approximates the return authorized in the company s last electric rate case in and includes a return on equity 
the company expects to achieve timely compliance as a result of the project 
construction of the first scr at culley was placed into service in october  and construction of the warrick and brown scr s is proceeding on schedule 
installation of scr technology as planned is expected to reduce the company s overall nox emissions to levels compliant with indiana s nox emissions budget allotted by the usepa 
therefore  the company has recorded no accrual for potential penalties that may result from noncompliance 
culley generating station litigation in the late s  the usepa initiated an investigation under section of the act of sigeco s coal fired electric generating units in commercial operation by to determine compliance with environmental permitting requirements related to repairs  maintenance  modifications  and operations changes 
the focus of the investigation was to determine whether new source review permitting requirements were triggered by such plant modifications  and whether the best available control technology was  or should have been used 
numerous electric utilities were  and are currently  being investigated by the usepa under an industry wide review for compliance 
in july  sigeco received a letter from the office of enforcement and compliance assurance of the usepa discussing the industry wide investigation  vaguely referring to an investigation of sigeco and inviting sigeco to participate in a discussion of the issues 
no specifics were noted  furthermore  the letter stated that the communication was not intended to serve as a notice of violation 
subsequent meetings were conducted in september and october with the usepa and targeted utilities  including sigeco  regarding potential remedies to the usepa s general allegations 
on november   the usepa filed a lawsuit against seven utilities  including sigeco 
sigeco s suit was filed in the us district court for the southern district of indiana 
the usepa alleged that  beginning in  sigeco violated the act by making modifications to its culley generating station in yankeetown  indiana without obtaining required permits making major modifications to the culley generating station without installing the best available emission control technology and failing to notify the usepa of the modifications 
in addition  the lawsuit alleged that the modifications to the culley generating station required sigeco to begin complying with federal new source performance standards at its culley unit the usepa also issued an administrative notice of violation to sigeco making the same allegations  but alleging that violations began in on june   sigeco  the department of justice doj  and the usepa announced an agreement that would resolve the lawsuit 
the agreement was embodied in a consent decree filed in us district court for the southern district of indiana 
the mandatory public comment period has expired  and no comments were received 
the court entered the consent decree on august  under the terms of the agreement  the doj and usepa have agreed to drop all challenges of past maintenance and repair activities at the culley coal fired units 
in reaching the agreement  sigeco did not admit to any allegations in the government s complaint  and sigeco continues to believe that it acted in accordance with applicable regulations and conducted only routine maintenance on the units 
sigeco has entered into this agreement to further its continued commitment to improve air quality and avoid the cost and uncertainties of litigation 
under the agreement  sigeco has committed to o either repower culley unit mw with natural gas  which would significantly reduce air emissions from this unit  and equip it with scr control technology for further reduction of nitrogen oxide  or cease operation of the unit by december   o operate the existing scr control technology recently installed on culley unit mw year round at a lower emission rate than that currently required under the nox sip call  resulting in further nitrogen oxide reductions  o enhance the efficiency of the existing scrubber at culley units and for additional removal of sulphur dioxide emissions  o install a baghouse for further particulate matter reductions at culley unit by june   o conduct a sulphuric acid reduction demonstration project as an environmental mitigation project designed to demonstrate an advance in pollution control technology for the reduction of sulfate emissions  and o pay a  civil penalty 
the company anticipates that the settlement would result in total capital expenditures through in a range between million and million 
other than the  civil penalty  which was accrued in the second quarter of  the implementation of the settlement  including these capital expenditures and related operating expenses  are expected to be recovered through rates 
information request on january   sigeco received an information request from the usepa under section of the act for historical operational information on the warrick and ab brown generating stations 
sigeco has provided all information requested with the most recent correspondence provided on march  manufactured gas plants in the past  indiana gas and others operated facilities for the manufacture of gas 
given the availability of natural gas transported by pipelines  these facilities have not been operated for many years 
under currently applicable environmental laws and regulations  indiana gas and others may now be required to take remedial action if certain byproducts are found above the regulatory thresholds at these sites 
indiana gas has identified the existence  location  and certain general characteristics of gas manufacturing and storage sites for which it may have some remedial responsibility 
indiana gas has completed a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs at one of the sites under an agreed order between indiana gas and the idem  and a record of decision was issued by the idem in january although indiana gas has not begun an ri fs at additional sites  indiana gas has submitted several of the sites to the idem s voluntary remediation program vrp and is currently conducting some level of remedial activities  including groundwater monitoring at certain sites  where deemed appropriate  and will continue remedial activities at the sites as appropriate and necessary 
in conjunction with data compiled by environmental consultants  indiana gas has accrued the estimated costs for further investigation  remediation  groundwater monitoring  and related costs for the sites 
while the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time  indiana gas has recorded costs that it reasonably expects to incur totaling approximately million 
the estimated accrued costs are limited to indiana gas proportionate share of the remediation efforts 
indiana gas has arrangements in place for of the sites with other potentially responsible parties prp  which serve to limit indiana gas share of response costs at these sites to between and 
with respect to insurance coverage  indiana gas has received and recorded settlements from all known insurance carriers in an aggregate amount approximating million 
environmental matters related to manufactured gas plants have had no material impact on earnings since costs recorded to date approximate prp and insurance settlement recoveries 
while indiana gas has recorded all costs which it presently expects to incur in connection with activities at these sites  it is possible that future events may require some level of additional remedial activities which are not presently foreseen 
in october  the company received a formal information request letter from the idem regarding five manufactured gas plants owned and or operated by sigeco and not currently enrolled in the idem s vrp 
in response  sigeco submitted to the idem the results of preliminary site investigations conducted in the mid s 
these site investigations confirmed that based upon the conditions known at the time  the sites posed no risk to human health or the environment 
follow up reviews have been initiated by the company to confirm that the sites continue to pose no such risk 
on october   sigeco filed applications to enter four of the manufactured gas plant sites in idem s vrp 
the remaining site is currently being addressed in the vrp by another indiana utility 
sigeco is adding its four sites into the renewal of the global voluntary remediation agreement that indiana gas has in place with idem for its manufactured gas plant sites 
the total costs  net of other prp involvement and insurance recoveries  that may be incurred in connection with further investigation  and if necessary  remedial work at the four sigeco sites cannot be determined at this time 
rate and regulatory matters gas and electric operations with regard to retail rates and charges  terms of service  accounting matters  issuance of securities  and certain other operational matters specific to its indiana customers are regulated by the iurc 
the retail gas operations of the ohio operations are subject to regulation by the puco 
all metered gas rates in indiana contain a gas cost adjustment gca clause  and all metered gas rates in ohio contain a gas cost recovery gcr clause 
gca and gcr clauses allow the company to charge for changes in the cost of purchased gas 
metered electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause fac that allows for adjustment in charges for electric energy to reflect changes in the cost of fuel and the net energy cost of purchased power 
rate structures in the company s territories do not include weather normalization type clauses that authorize the utility to recover gross margin on sales established in its last general rate case  regardless of actual weather patterns 
gca  gcr  and fac procedures involve periodic filings and iurc and puco hearings to establish the amount of price adjustments for a designated future period 
the procedures also provide for inclusion in later periods of any variances between the estimated cost of gas  cost of fuel  and net energy cost of purchased power and actual costs incurred 
the company records any under or over recovery resulting from gas and fuel adjustment clauses each month in revenues 
a corresponding asset or liability is recorded until the under or over recovery is billed or refunded to utility customers 
the iurc has also applied the statute authorizing gca and fac procedures to reduce rates when necessary to limit net operating income to a level authorized in its last general rate order through the application of an earnings test 
for the recent past  the earnings test has not affected the company s ability to recover costs  and the company does not anticipate the earnings test will restrict recovery in the near future 
ohio uncollectible accounts expense tracker on december   the puco approved a request by vedo and several other regulated ohio gas utilities to establish a mechanism to recover uncollectible account expense outside of base rates 
the tariff mechanism establishes an automatic adjustment procedure to track and recover these costs instead of providing the recovery of the historic amount in base rates 
through this order  vedo received authority to defer its uncollectible accounts expense to the extent it differs from the level included in base rates 
the company estimated the difference to approximate million in excess of that included in base rates  and accordingly reversed previously established reserves and recorded a regulatory asset for the difference  totaling million 
gas cost recovery gcr audit proceedings there is an ohio requirement that ohio gas utilities undergo a biannual audit of their gas acquisition practices in connection with the gas cost recovery gcr mechanism 
in the case of vedo  the two year period began in november  coincident with the company s acquisition of the ohio operations and commencement of service in ohio 
the audit provides the initial review of the portfolio administration arrangement between vedo and proliance 
the external auditor retained by the puco staff recently submitted an audit report wherein it recommended a disallowance of approximately million of previously recovered gas costs 
the company believes a large portion of the third party auditor recommendations is without merit 
there are two elements of the recommendations relating to the treatment of a pipeline refund and a penalty which vedo does not oppose 
a hearing has been held  and based on its audit report  the puco staff has recommended a million disallowance 
the ohio consumer counselor has submitted testimony to support an million disallowance 
for this puco audit period  any disallowance relating to the company s proliance arrangement will be shared by the company s joint venture partner 
based on a review of the matters  the company has reserved million for its estimated share of a potential disallowance 
the company believes that these proceedings will not likely have a material effect on the company s operating results or financial condition 
however  the company can provide no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of this proceeding 
recovery of purchased power as a result of an appeal of a generic order issued by the iurc in august regarding guidelines for the recovery of purchased power costs  sigeco entered into a settlement agreement with the oucc that provides certain terms with respect to the recoverability of such costs 
the settlement  originally approved by the iurc in august  has been extended by agreement through march  and discussions regarding further extension of the settlement term are ongoing 
under the settlement  sigeco can recover the entire cost of purchased power up to an established benchmark  and during forced outages  sigeco will bear a limited share of its purchased power costs regardless of the market costs at that time 
based on this agreement  sigeco believes it has limited its exposure to unrecoverable purchased power costs 
regulatory initiatives in addition to the timely recovery of incremental nox environmental expenditures discussed above  the company is pursuing base rate cases in its three gas territories 
the last general rate increase for vedo and indiana gas was in  and was in for sigeco gas 
the company is currently in a collaborative dialogue with the oucc regarding sigeco s existing gas rates 
if an agreement is reached between the parties as a result of that process  it will be subject to review and approval by the iurc

the timing and ultimate outcome of any of these regulatory initiatives is uncertain 
results of operations of the nonregulated group the nonregulated group is comprised of four primary business areas energy marketing and services  coal mining  utility infrastructure services  and broadband 
energy marketing and services markets natural gas and provides energy management services  including energy performance contracting services 
coal mining mines and sells coal and generates irs code section investment tax credits relating to the production of coal based synthetic fuels 
utility infrastructure services provides underground construction and repair  facilities locating  and meter reading services 
broadband invests in broadband communication services such as analog and digital cable television  high speed internet and data services  and advanced local and long distance phone services 
in addition  the nonregulated group has other businesses that provide utility services  municipal broadband consulting  and retail products and services  and that invest in energy related opportunities  real estate  and leveraged leases 
the nonregulated group supports the company s regulated utilities pursuant to service contracts by providing natural gas supply services  coal  utility infrastructure services  and other services 
the results of operations of the nonregulated group before certain intersegment eliminations and reclassifications for the years ended december    and  follow in millions  except per share amounts energy services other revenues operating expenses cost of energy services other operating expenses restructuring costs total operating expenses operating income other income equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates other net total other income interest expense income before taxes income taxes minority interest income before extraordinary loss extraordinary loss net of tax net income basic earnings per share net income attributed to energy marketing services coal mining utility infrastructure broadband other businesses nonregulated earnings for the year ended december   increased million 
energy marketing and services recurring operations contributed million in earnings  or million of the increase over a majority of the energy marketing and services earnings were generated by gas marketing operations  and a majority of the increase  or million  was contributed by performance contracting operations 
coal mining increased million due to increased synfuel related earnings  offset by lower mining results 
in addition  net gains totaling million after tax were recognized in from business and investment divestitures 
for the year ended december   earnings from the nonregulated group increased million when compared to the increase is primarily due to increased earnings from gas marketing operations which are part of the energy marketing and services and a smaller loss incurred by the company s broadband consulting operations which are part of other businesses 
the year ended december   included million after tax  or per share  in nonrecurring restructuring costs and million after tax  or per share  related to an extraordinary loss from the divestiture of leveraged leases 
in addition  benefited from gains recognized upon sale of investments by an unconsolidated affiliate  and was negatively affected by a change in indiana corporate income tax laws enacted in june  which required the recalculation of deferred tax obligations and earnings from leveraged lease investments at the date of enactment of the law 
energy marketing services energy marketing and services is comprised of the company s gas marketing and performance contracting operations and held the company s investment in genscape  inc genscape  a company that provides real time power plant and transmission line status information using wireless technology 
the investment in genscape was sold in the third quarter of resulting in an after tax gain of million 
gas marketing operations are performed through the company s investment in proliance energy llc proliance  a nonregulated energy marketing affiliate of vectren and citizens gas and coke utility citizens gas 
proliance provides natural gas and related services to indiana gas  the ohio operations  and citizens gas and also began providing services to sigeco and vectren retail  llc the company s retail gas marketer in proliance s primary businesses include gas marketing  gas portfolio optimization  and other portfolio and energy management services 
proliance s primary customers are utilities and other large end use customers 
in june  the integration of vectren s wholly owned gas marketing subsidiary  sigcorp energy services  llc ses  with proliance was completed 
ses provided natural gas and related services to sigeco and others prior to the integration 
in exchange for the contribution of ses net assets totaling million  vectren s allocable share of proliance s profits and losses increased from to  consistent with vectren s new ownership percentage 
the transfer of net assets was accounted for at book value  consistent with joint venture accounting  and did not result in any gain or loss 
in march  vectren s allocable share of profits and losses increased from to when proliance began managing the ohio operations gas portfolio 
governance and voting rights remain at for each member  and therefore  vectren continues to account for its investment in proliance using the equity method of accounting 
energy systems group  llc esg provides energy performance contracting and facility upgrades through its design and installation of energy efficient equipment 
prior to april  esg was a consolidated venture between the company and citizens gas with the company owning two thirds 
in april  the company purchased the remaining interest in esg for approximately million 
net income generated by energy marketing and services for the year ended december   was million  as compared to million in and million in gas marketing operations  performed through proliance  contributed million in earnings in  as compared to million in  and million in the million increase over was principally attributable to increased storage capacity coupled with more volatile gas prices  offset by settlement disputes related to the contingency discussed below 
the million increase in compared to is primarily due to increased operations at proliance and increased ownership 
the performance contracting operations  performed through esg  contributed earnings million in  million in  and million in the million increase in compared to is due primarily to success in obtaining higher margins and working from a higher construction backlog at the end of as well as increased ownership as of april proliance contingency there is currently a lawsuit pending in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama filed by the city of huntsville  alabama d b a huntsville utilities  inc huntsville utilities against proliance 
huntsville utilities asserts claims based on negligent provision of portfolio services and or pricing advice  fraud  fraudulent inducement  and other theories 
these claims relate generally to several basic arguments negligence in providing advice and or administering portfolio arrangements  alleged promises to provide gas at a below market rate  the creation and repayment of a winter levelizing program instituted by proliance in conjunction with the manager of huntsville s gas utility  to allow huntsville utilities to pay its gas bills from the winter of over an extended period of time coupled with the alleged ignorance about the program on the part of huntsville utilities gas board  and  the sale of huntsville utilities gas storage supplies to repay the balance owed on the winter levelizing program and the authority of huntsville utilities gas manager to approve those sales 
in a press conference on may   huntsville utilities asserted its monetary damages to be approximately million  and seeks to treble that amount 
proliance has made counterclaims asserting breach of contract  among others  based on huntsville utilities refusal to take gas under fixed price agreements 
both parties have denied the charges contained in the respective claims 
in  proliance established reserves for amounts due from huntsville utilities due to uncertainties surrounding collection 
proliance denies any wrongdoing  believes its actions were proper under the contract and amendments signed by the manager of huntsville s gas utility  and is vigorously defending against the suit 
proliance is an insured under a policy of insurance providing defense costs which may provide in whole or in part  indemnification within the policy limits for claims asserted against proliance 
accordingly  no other loss contingencies have been recorded at this time 
however  it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation and accordingly there can be no assurance that proliance will prevail 
it is not currently expected that costs associated with this matter will have a material adverse effect on vectren s consolidated financial position or liquidity but an unfavorable outcome could possibly be material to vectren s earnings 
coal mining the coal mining group mines and sells coal to the company s utility operations and to other third parties through its wholly owned subsidiary vectren fuels  inc fuels 
the coal mining group also generates irs code section investment tax credits relating to the production of coal based synthetic fuels through its ownership interest in pace carbon synfuels  lp pace carbon 
pace carbon developed  owns  and operates four projects to produce and sell coal based synthetic fuel synfuel utilizing covol technology 
vectren accounts for is investment in pace carbon using the equity method 
in addition  fuels receives synfuel related fees from synfuel producers unrelated to pace carbon for a portion of its coal production 
coal mining net income for the year ended december   was million  as compared to million in  and million in synfuel related results  which include earnings from pace carbon and synfuel processing fees earned by fuels  contributed all of the earnings in  million in  and million in increasing production of synthetic fuel by pace carbon in and has generated a greater amount of section tax credits that have been utilized by the company  reducing income tax expense in those years 
the increase in synfuel related earnings has been offset by mining operations that have experienced decreased yields due to poor mining conditions and increased mine development cost amortization 
irs section investment tax credit recent developments under section of the internal revenue code  manufacturers such as pace carbon  receive a tax credit for every ton of synthetic fuel sold 
to qualify for the credits  the synthetic fuel must meet three primary conditions there must be a significant chemical change in the coal feedstock  the product must be sold to an unrelated person  and the production facility must have been placed in service before july  in past rulings  the internal revenue service irs has concluded that the synthetic fuel produced at the pace carbon facilities should qualify for section tax credits 
the irs issued a private letter ruling with respect to the four projects on november   and subsequently issued an updated private letter ruling on september  as a partner in pace carbon  vectren has reflected total tax credits under section in its consolidated results through december   of approximately million 
vectren has been in a position to fully utilize the credits generated and continues to project full utilization 
in june  the irs  in an industry wide announcement  stated that it would review the scientific validity of test procedures and results presented as evidence of significant chemical change 
during this review  the irs suspended the issuance of new private letter rulings on that subject 
in october  the irs completed its review and determined that the test procedures and results used by taxpayers are scientifically valid if the procedures are applied in a consistent and unbiased manner 
also  the irs will issue new private letter rulings based on revised standards  however  it has continuing concerns regarding the sampling and data record retention practices prevalent in the synthetic fuels industry 
during june  the irs began a tax audit of pace carbon for the tax year and later expanded the audit to include tax years   and based on conclusions reached in the industry wide review and recently issued private letter rulings involving other synthetic fuel facilities  vectren believes chemical change issues from these audits may soon be resolved 
however  the irs has not directly notified pace carbon of any resolution 
vectren believes it is justified in its reliance on the private letter rulings for the pace carbon facilities  that the test results that pace carbon presented to the irs in connection with its private letter rulings are scientifically valid  and that pace carbon has operated its facilities in compliance with its private letter rulings and section of the internal revenue code 
however  at this time  vectren cannot provide any assurance as to the outcome of these audits concerning the issue of chemical change or any other issue raised during the audits relative to its investment in pace carbon 
further  it is expected that section investments will continue to draw attention from various interest groups 
utility infrastructure services utility infrastructure services provides underground construction and repair to gas  water  electric and telecommunications companies primarily through its investment in reliant services  llc reliant and reliant s ownership in miller pipeline 
reliant is a owned strategic alliance with an affiliate of cinergy corp 
and is accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
results in recent years have been affected by cutbacks of underground construction and repair projects by gas distribution customers 
in the second half of  miller returned to profitability due to an increase in construction and repair projects as utilities began to return to historical expenditure levels 
broadband broadband invests in communication services  such as cable television  high speed internet  and advanced local and long distance phone services 
the company has an approximate equity interest and a convertible subordinated debt investment in utilicom networks  llc utilicom that if converted bring the company s ownership interest up to 
utilicom is a provider of bundled communication services focusing on last mile delivery to residential and commercial customers 
the company also has an approximate equity interest in sigecom holdings  inc holdings  which was formed by utilicom to hold interests in sigecom  llc sigecom 
sigecom provides broadband services to over  customers  averaging nearly revenue generating units per customer  in the greater evansville  indiana area and continues to increase its positive operating cash flow 
the equity investments in utilicom and holdings are accounted for using the cost method of accounting 
as a result  for years ended december    and  these investments had no significant impact on the company s operating results 
utilicom also plans to provide broadband services to the greater indianapolis  indiana and dayton  ohio markets 
however  the funding of these projects has been delayed due to the continued difficult environment within the telecommunication capital markets  which has prevented utilicom from obtaining debt financing on terms it considers acceptable 
while the existing investors remain interested in the indianapolis and dayton projects  the company is not required to make further investments and does not intend to proceed unless commitments are obtained to fully fund these projects 
franchising agreements have been extended in both locations 
for the year ended december   broadband losses were million 
this reflects the impact of a million after tax loss on the sale of the company s investment in first mile  a small broadband operation in indianapolis  indiana 
other businesses the other businesses group includes a variety of wholly owned operations and investments 
for the year ended december   the other businesses group losses  including operating expenses  were million  as compared to losses of million in  and losses of million in the million improvement occurring in resulted from a million after tax gain recognized upon sale of ieifs  llc ieifs  a debt collection subsidiary  and the operating results of vectren retail  llc vectren source 
vectren source began operations in and provides natural gas and other related products and services primarily in ohio  serving over  customers opting for choice among energy providers 
source s losses for the year ended december   were million  as compared to million in the net loss incurred in compared to narrowed million 
the improvement results from a million extraordinary loss incurred in related to the divesture of leveraged leases that generated positive cash flow of approximately million 
in addition  the company s wholly owned broadband consulting company incurred charges in and related to the settlement of construction contracts and the reorganization of its operations  allowing it to focus on consulting services 
the net losses incurred in those years totaled million in  as compared million in these factors have been partially offset by less leveraged lease and other interest income in due to divestures  a change in indiana tax law in  and gains recognized in from the haddington energy partnerships haddington sale of investments 
the haddington partnerships are equity method investments that invest in energy related ventures 
during  these partnerships sold investments resulting in gains reflected by the company totaling million million after tax 
the most significant portion of these earnings was derived from haddington s sale of bear paw investments  llc bear paw 
in march  haddington sold its investment in bear paw in exchange for a combination of cash and securities 
the cost of haddington s bear paw investment approximated million  and the net proceeds received totaled million  resulting in a gain of million 
the company recognized its portion of the pre tax gain totaling million in march later in  as the securities received were sold  the company recognized its portion of the additional earnings totaling million 
significant fluctuations revenues and cost of revenues resulting from the integration of the company s two gas marketers  revenues and cost of revenues decreased significantly 
prior to june   the operations of ses were consolidated 
subsequent to june   ses operating results  now part of proliance  are reflected in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
ses operations were the majority of nonregulated revenues and cost of revenues 
as a result of the integration  revenues decreased million in and million in cost of revenues decreased million in and million in the decreases have been partially offset by increased results at esg  fuels  and vectren source 
vectren source s revenues were million in  million in  and million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates the primary components of equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates relate to earnings of proliance and losses incurred by pace carbon 
for the years ended december    and  the company s portion of proliance s earnings were million  million  and million  respectively 
for the years ended december    and  the company s portion of pace carbon losses were million  million  and million  respectively 
in addition  includes million in earnings from the haddington partnerships  as discussed above 
other net during  other net increased million 
the increase is due to the gain recognized from the sale of genscape  which on a pre tax basis approximated just over million 
the decrease in compared to totaling million is primarily due to less leverage lease and interest income  which is an effect of the divestures of structured finance arrangements in and critical accounting policies management is required to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain estimates used in the financial statements are subjective and use variables that require judgment 
these include the estimates to perform goodwill and other asset impairments tests and to determine pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the company makes other estimates in the course of accounting for unbilled revenue and the effects of regulation that are critical to the company s financial results but that are less likely to be impacted by near term changes 
other estimates that significantly affect the company s results  but are not necessarily critical to operations  include depreciation of utility and non utility plant  the valuation of derivative contracts  and the allowance for doubtful accounts  among others 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
impairment review of investments the company has investments in notes receivable  entities accounted for using the cost method of accounting  and entities accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
when events occur that may cause one of these investments to be impaired  the company performs an impairment analysis 
an impairment analysis of notes receivable usually involves the comparison of the investment s estimated free cash flows to the stated terms of the note  or for notes that are collateral dependent  a comparison of the collateral s fair value to the carrying amount of the note 
an impairment analysis of cost method and equity method investments involves comparison of the investment s estimated fair value to its carrying amount 
fair value is estimated using market comparisons  appraisals  and or discounted cash flow analyses 
calculating free cash flows and fair value using the above methods is subjective and requires significant judgment in growth assumptions  longevity of cash flows  and discount rates for fair value calculations 
during  the company performed an impairment analysis on its utilicom related investments 
the company used market comparisons to estimate fair value for the cost method portion of the utilicom investment and a free cash flow analysis to estimate fair value for the note receivable portion of the utilicom investment 
no impairment charge was recorded as a result of these tests 
however  a decrease in the fair value that was estimated using market comparables would have resulted in an impairment charge to the cost method investment that would not have been material 
a decrease in the cash flow growth assumption utilized to calculate utilicom s free cash flows would have resulted in no impairment charge to the notes receivable 
during  no impairment analysis was performed as no triggering events occurred during the year 
impairment tests on other investments were also conducted using appraisals and discounted cash flow models to estimate fair value 
no impairment charges resulted from these analyses in and a million write off of the babb investments resulted in for the other impairment tests performed during  a adverse change in the calculated or appraised fair value of collateral or a basis point adverse change in the discount rate used to estimate fair value would have resulted in an approximate million impairment charge 
a adverse change of such factors would not have affected the babb write off 
goodwill pursuant to sfas no 
 the company performed an initial impairment analysis of its goodwill  all of which resides in the gas utility services operating segment 
also consistent with sfas  goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the beginning of the year and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred 
impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level which the company has determined to be consistent with its gas utility services operating segment as identified in note to the consolidated financial statements 
an impairment test performed in accordance with sfas requires that a reporting unit s fair value be estimated 
the company used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its gas utility services operating segment  and that estimated fair value was compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value was in excess of the carrying amount in both and and therefore resulted in no impairment 
estimating fair value using a discounted cash flow model is subjective and requires significant judgment in applying a discount rate  growth assumptions  company expense allocations  and longevity of cash flows 
a basis point increase in the discount rate utilized to calculate the gas utility services segment s fair value also would have resulted in no impairment charge in or pension and other postretirement obligations the company estimates the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of compensation increase  and future health care costs  among other things  and relies on actuarial estimates to assess the future potential liability and funding requirements of the company s pension and postretirement plans 
the company annually measures its obligations on september the company used the following weighted average assumptions to develop periodic benefit cost a discount rate of  an expected return on plan assets before expenses of  a rate of compensation increase of  and a health care cost trend rate of in declining to in during  the company reduced the discount rate and rate of compensation increase by basis points to value ending pension and postretirement obligations due to a decline in benchmark interest rates 
the company also lengthened to the time in which the health care trend rate declines to primarily due to increases in healthcare costs 
in addition  the company reduced its expected return on plan assets basis points from that used to estimate expense due to recent lower investment returns and lower interest rates 
future changes in health care costs  work force demographics  interest rates  or plan changes could significantly affect the estimated cost of these future benefits 
for the year ended december   a one percentage point adverse change in the assumed health care cost trend rate for the postretirement health care plans would have decreased pre tax income by approximately million and would have increased the postretirement liability by approximately million 
management estimates that a basis point reduction in the expected return on plan assets would have increased periodic benefit cost by approximately million and a basis point decrease in the discount rate would have also increased periodic benefit cost by approximately million 
unbilled revenues to more closely match revenues and expenses  the company records revenues for all gas and electricity delivered to customers but not billed at the end of the accounting period 
the company uses actual units billed during the month to allocate unbilled units 
those allocated units are multiplied by rates in effect during the month to calculate unbilled revenue at balance sheet dates 
while certain estimates are used in the calculation of unbilled revenue  the method these estimates are derived from is not subject to near term changes 
regulation at each reporting date  the company reviews current regulatory trends in the markets in which it operates 
this review involves judgment and is critical in assessing the recoverability of regulatory assets as well as the ability to continue to account for its activities based on the criteria set forth in sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
based on the company s current review  it believes its regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
if all or part of the company s operations cease to meet the criteria of sfas  a write off of related regulatory assets and liabilities could be required 
in addition  the company would be required to determine any impairment to the carrying value of its utility plant and other regulated assets 
in the unlikely event of a change in the current regulatory environment  such write offs and impairment charges could be significant

vuhi s outstanding long term and short term borrowing arrangements are jointly and severally guaranteed by indiana gas  sigeco  and vedo 
vuhi s long term and short term obligations outstanding at december   totaled million and million  respectively 
additionally  prior to vuhi s formation  indiana gas and sigeco funded their operations separately  and therefore  have long term debt outstanding funded solely by their operations 
the company s common stock dividends are primarily funded by utility operations 
nonregulated operations have demonstrated sustained profitability  and the ability to generate cash flows 
these cash flows are used to fund a portion of the company s dividends  are reinvested in other nonregulated ventures  and from time to time may be reinvested in utility operations or used for corporate expenses

sources uses of liquidity operating cash flow the company s primary historical source of liquidity to fund working capital requirements has been cash generated from operations 
cash flow from operating activities decreased during the year ended december   compared to by million and increased million in compared to the primary reason for these changes was favorable changes in working capital accounts occurring in due to lower gas prices in that year and higher gas prices in and in  the decrease was partially offset by increased earnings before non cash charges 
financing cash flow although working capital requirements are generally funded by cash flow from operations  the company uses short term borrowings to supplement working capital needs 
additionally  short term borrowings are required for capital projects and investments until they are permanently financed 
cash flow provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december   includes the effects of the permanent financing executed during the current year in which approximately million in equity  debt  and hedging net proceeds were received and used to retire higher coupon long term debt and other short term borrowings 
common stock dividends have increased in compared to due to the issuance of new securities and board authorized increases in the dividend rate

in august  the registration became effective  and an agreement was reached to sell approximately million shares to a group of underwriters 
the net proceeds totaled million and were utilized entirely by vuhi and vuhi s subsidiaries to repay short term borrowings and to retire long term debt with higher interest rates

these guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several 
in addition  they have no sinking fund requirements  and interest payments are due semi annually

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various business risks associated with commodity prices  interest rates  and counter party credit 
these financial exposures are monitored and managed by the company as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
the company s risk management program includes  among other things  the use of derivatives 
the company also executes derivative contracts in the normal course of operations while buying and selling commodities to be used in operations and optimizing its generation assets 
commodity price risk the company s regulated operations have limited exposure to commodity price risk for purchases and sales of natural gas and electricity for retail customers due to current indiana and ohio regulations  which subject to compliance with those regulations  allow for recovery of the cost of such purchases through natural gas and fuel cost adjustment mechanisms 
electric sales and purchases in the wholesale power market and other commodity related operations are exposed to commodity price risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices including electricity  natural gas  and coal 
other commodity related operations include regulated sales of electricity to certain municipalities and large industrial customers and nonregulated retail gas marketing and coal mining operations 
open positions in terms of price  volume  and specified delivery points may occur and are managed using methods described below with frequent management reporting 
the company s wholesale power marketing activities include asset optimization activities that manage the utilization of available electric generating capacity by entering into energy contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell electricity in the future 
commodity price risk results from forward positions that commit the company to deliver electricity 
the company mitigates price risk exposure with planned unutilized generation capability and offsetting forward purchase contracts 
the company accounts for asset optimization contracts that are derivatives at fair value with the offset marked to market through earnings 
the company s other commodity related operations involve the purchase and sale of commodities  including electricity  natural gas  and coal to meet customer demands and operational needs 
these operations also enter into forward and option contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell commodities in the future 
price risk from forward positions obligating the company to deliver commodities is mitigated using stored inventory  generating capability  and offsetting forward purchase contracts 
price risk also results from forward contracts obligating the company to purchase commodities to fulfill forecasted nonregulated sales of natural gas and coal that may  or may not  occur 
with the exception of a small portion of contracts that are derivatives that qualify as hedges of forecasted transactions under sfas  these contracts are expected to be settled by physical receipt or delivery of the commodity 
market risk resulting from commodity contracts is measured by management using the potential impact on pre tax earnings caused by the effect a adverse change in forward commodity prices might have on market sensitive derivative positions outstanding on specific dates 
for the years ended december   and  a adverse change in forward commodity prices would have decreased earnings by million and million  respectively  based upon open positions existing on the last day of those years 
commodity price risk from unconsolidated affiliate proliance  a nonregulated energy marketing affiliate  engages in energy hedging activities to manage pricing decisions  minimize the risk of price volatility  and minimize price risk exposure in the energy markets 
proliance s market exposure arises from storage inventory  imbalances  and fixed price forward purchase and sale contracts  which are entered into to support its operating activities 
currently  proliance buys and sells physical commodities and utilizes financial instruments to hedge its market exposure 
however  net open positions in terms of price  volume and specified delivery point do occur 
proliance manages open positions with policies which limit its exposure to market risk and require reporting potential financial exposure to its management and its members 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its borrowing arrangements 
its risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility may have on interest expense 
the company s risk management objective is for between and of its total debt to be exposed to short term interest rate volatility 
however  there are times when this targeted range of interest rate exposure may not be attained 
to manage this exposure  the company may use derivative financial instruments 
at december   such debt obligations  as affected by designated interest rate swaps  represented of the company s total debt portfolio 
market risk is estimated as the potential impact resulting from fluctuations in interest rates on adjustable rate borrowing arrangements exposed to short term interest rate volatility 
during and  the weighted average combined borrowings under these arrangements were million and million  respectively 
at december   and  combined borrowings under these arrangements were million and million  respectively 
based upon average borrowing rates under these facilities during the years ended december   and  an increase of basis points one percentage point in the rates would have increased interest expense by million and million  respectively 
other risks by using forward purchase contracts and derivative financial instruments to manage risk  the company exposes itself to counter party credit risk and market risk 
the company manages exposure to counter party credit risk by entering into contracts with companies that can be reasonably expected to fully perform under the terms of the contract 
counter party credit risk is monitored regularly and positions are adjusted appropriately to manage risk 
further  tools such as netting arrangements and requests for collateral are also used to manage credit risk 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in commodity prices or interest rates 
the company attempts to manage exposure to market risk associated with commodity contracts and interest rates by establishing parameters and monitoring those parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
the company s customer receivables from gas and electric sales and gas transportation services are primarily derived from a diversified base of residential  commercial  and industrial customers located in indiana and west central ohio 
the company manages credit risk associated with its receivables by continually reviewing creditworthiness and requests cash deposits or refunds cash deposits based on that review 
credit risk associated with certain investments is also managed by a review of creditworthiness and receipt of collateral 
although the company s regulated operations are exposed to limited commodity price risk  volatile natural gas prices can result in higher working capital requirements  increased expenses including unrecoverable interest costs  uncollectible accounts expense  and unaccounted for gas  and some level of price sensitive reduction in volumes sold 
the company mitigates these risks by executing derivative contracts that manage the price of forecasted natural gas purchases 
these contracts are subject to regulation  which allows for reasonable and prudent hedging costs to be recovered through rates 
when regulation is involved  sfas controls when the offset to mark to market accounting is recognized in earnings
