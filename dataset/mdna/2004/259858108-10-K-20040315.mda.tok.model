item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are focused on the discovery  in licensing  development and commercialization of novel drug candidates for the treatment of cns and other disorders  cardiovascular and urological  that involve alterations in neuronal processing 
in  we licensed four of our product candidates from wyeth indiplon  for the treatment of insomnia  bicifadine  for the treatment of pain  ocinaplon  for the treatment of anxiety  and dov  for the treatment of depression 
we sublicensed indiplon to neurocrine in in exchange for the right to receive payments upon the achievement of certain clinical development milestones and royalties based on product sales  if any 
neurocrine has subsequently entered into a development and commercialization agreement with pfizer for indiplon 
since our inception  we have incurred significant operating losses and we expect to do so for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have depended upon equity and debt financings and license fee  research and development and milestone payments from our collaborative partners and licensees to fund our research and product development programs and expect to do so for the foreseeable future 
we have a relatively limited history of operations and anticipate that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate for several reasons  including the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  the timing and extent of our adding new employees and infrastructure  the timing of milestone  license fee and royalty receipts and payments and the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals 
our revenue has consisted primarily of license fees and milestone payments from our collaborative partners and licensees 
we record revenue on an accrual basis when amounts are considered collectible 
revenue received in advance of performance obligations  or in cases where we have a continuing obligation to perform services  is deferred and amortized over the performance period 
revenue from milestone payments that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process is recorded when the milestone is achieved 
contract revenues are recorded as the services are performed 
license and milestone revenue are typically not consistent or recurring in nature 
our revenue has fluctuated from year to year and quarter to quarter and this will likely continue 
our operating expenses consist primarily of royalty and license expense  costs associated with research and development and general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
royalty and license expense consists of milestone payments accrued and paid under our license agreement with wyeth and license fees paid in connection with the termination of the biovail agreement 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and other related costs of our personnel dedicated to research and development activities  as well as outside clinical trial expenses and professional fees related to clinical trials  toxicology studies and preclinical studies 
research and development expense also includes our expenses related to development activities of dov bermuda 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of the costs of our senior management  finance and administrative staff  business insurance  professional fees and costs associated with being a public reporting entity 
we expect research and development expense to increase substantially in the foreseeable future 
we expect that a large percentage of this will be incurred in support of our clinical trial programs and toxicology studies for bicifadine  dov  dov  dov diltiazem and  subject to the fda s releasing its clinical hold placed upon our planned phase iii clinical trial  ocinaplon  as well as our product candidates in our preclinical program if they progress into clinical trials 
dov  and dov  currently in our preclinical program  have been designated as clinical candidates and we therefore expect to incur additional expenditures on these two product candidates in it is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of products to each take five years or more  and for total development costs to exceed million for each product 
we are not responsible for the clinical program for indiplon 
we  therefore  are unable to estimate the amount of expenditures necessary to complete any of such product candidate s development 
as of december   we have spent approximately million on the development of bicifadine and million on the development of ocinaplon in connection with their respective clinical development programs 
additionally  we have incurred million in technology license fees for the two products and the elan technology and million on the acquisition of the remaining rights to these products from elan as described below 
as of december   we have incurred approximately million and million in development expenses for dov  and dov  respectively 
we expect that the development of our five product candidates in clinical development will require substantial additional time and expense 
the time and cost of completing the clinical development of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors  including the disease or medical condition to be treated  clinical trial design and endpoints  availability of patients to participate in trials  the results of clinical trials  the number of clinical trials required to be conducted  unanticipated trials  the length of time of the regulatory review process  the relative efficacy of the product versus treatments already approved and our ability to enter into new development collaborations 
in light of these many uncertainties  we are unable to estimate the length of time or the costs that will be required to complete the development of these product candidates 
in january  we entered into a joint venture with elan 
as part of the transaction  we formed dov bermuda to develop controlled release formulations of ocinaplon and bicifadine 
as of january   we owned of the outstanding common stock of dov bermuda 
however  elan retained significant minority investor rights that were treated as participating rights as defined in emerging issues task force consensus  or eitf  no 
investor s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights 
therefore  prior to december   we did not consolidate the financial statements of dov bermuda  but instead accounted for our investment in dov bermuda under the equity method of accounting 
we recorded our interest in the loss in dov bermuda as research and development expense for the portion of the research and development expense incurred by us on behalf of dov bermuda and as loss in investment in dov bermuda for our interest in the remaining loss of dov bermuda  including that attributable to research and development expense of elan 
as elan s rights to participate in the management of the joint venture expired as of january  we have consolidated of the results of dov bermuda as of january  additionally  since elan is no longer funding dov bermuda  we are recording of the loss of dov bermuda effective january  after funding the first and second quarter of loss  our equity ownership in the joint venture increased to from on october   we entered into a agreement with elan to acquire ownership of nascime limited  the joint venture s operating company  formed by elan and us in january to develop bicifadine and ocinaplon 
in connection with the acquisition  we paid million to a subsidiary of elan in respect of its equity stake in the joint venture 
elan granted to the operating company a non exclusive  royalty free  perpetual  worldwide license to make and sell the two product candidates in controlled release formulations using the elan intellectual property licensed to the joint venture  including that developed during the venture 
in connection with the license grant  elan will be entitled to receive up to an aggregate of million when the products are licensed or come to market 
this acquisition ends elan s involvement in the nearly five year joint venture established to develop controlled release formulations of ocinaplon and bicifadine 
in accordance with fasb  business combinations  the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of assets 
the acquisition by us of nascime and the product candidates  bicifadine and ocinaplon  relate to early stage technology that  in our opinion  has not yet reached technological feasibility  as the products will ultimately require regulatory approval prior to commercialization 
accordingly  the million purchase price and the  paid for taxes associated with the purchase was expensed as in process research and development in the fourth quarter of dov bermuda  the joint venture holding company  will remain in existence and the results of dov bermuda will continue to be consolidated 
however  as a result of the acquisition of of nascime  dov bermuda is not expected to incur additional research and development expenses and virtually no assets will remain within the entity 
in january  elan loaned us million in the form of a convertible promissory note to fund our investment in dov bermuda 
elan has the right to convert the outstanding principal amount of this note at any time  together with accrued unpaid interest  into shares of our common stock at per share 
alternatively  prior to january   elan could exchange the principal portion of the note for an additional equity interest in dov bermuda such that our equity interests would be equal 
this would have resulted in our transferring a portion of the shares we hold to elan 
we accounted for this exchange feature in accordance with eitf accounting implications of indexed debt instruments 
this required us to record an additional liability for this feature if the value of the interest elan could obtain in the joint venture was more than the principal amount of the note 
since we issued this note to elan  this feature did not resulted in any interest expense and  as described below  in march  the exchange feature of the note was eliminated 
the note may not be prepaid without elan s consent 
to the extent elan has not converted the note  the unpaid principal and accrued interest are due and payable on january  elan agreed  in january  to lend us up to million to fund our pro rata share of research and development funding in dov bermuda 
for this purpose  we issued to elan a convertible line of credit promissory note that bears interest at per annum compounded semi annually on the amount outstanding 
this convertible line of credit promissory note matures on january   at which time the principal amount and accrued unpaid interest become due and payable 
the convertible line of credit promissory note may not be prepaid by us without elan s prior written consent 
at any time prior to the date the convertible line of credit promissory note is repaid in full  elan has the right to convert the outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest of the convertible line of credit promissory note into shares of our common stock at per share 
as of december   we have drawn down million on the convertible line of credit promissory note and  with interest at per annum compounded semi annually  the note is carried at million at december  our ability to borrow further under the convertible line of credit promissory note expired in march please refer to note of our financial statements under part ii  item of this form k 
on march   we entered into an agreement with elan to amend the convertible promissory note originally issued by us to eis in january to eliminate the exchange right feature of this note 
all other significant terms of the note remain unchanged 
in connection with this amendment  eis received warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
these warrants expire on january  as of march   we determined the fair value of the warrants at in january  biovail and we entered into a license  research and development agreement to develop  manufacture and market dov diltiazem for the treatment of angina and hypertension 
through january  dov diltiazem was being jointly developed through the collaborative arrangement 
on march  we entered into a separation agreement with biovail that provided for the return of our december patent for the immediate release and controlled release formulations of diltiazem and termination of the exclusive license agreement with biovail for the development of dov diltiazem 
in october  the fda placed the start of our phase iii pivotal clinical trial of ocinaplon  our anti anxiety product candidate  on hold and requested that we produce additional safety information 
we have submitted a response to the fda and have requested that the fda lift the clinical hold 
we cannot assure you that we have submitted or will be able to submit all information expected by the fda or further information that may be requested by the fda  or that any information we do provide will be satisfactory to the fda  or that the fda will release the hold placed by it on the commencement of our phase iii pivotal clinical trial of ocinaplon or any revised clinical study designed to respond to the fda s safety concerns 
during and  in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  we accrued unearned compensation expense totaling million and  respectively 
these amounts represent the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date the options were granted and the applicable exercise prices for those options granted during the time period  and are amortized using an accelerated vesting method over the vesting period for the options 
this method results in increased compensation expense in earlier years than straight line vesting 
during  and  we recorded amortization of stock compensation expense of   and  respectively and in we recorded a non cash stock compensation expense of  for the acceleration of certain options for certain severed employees 
at december   and    and  remained to be amortized over the vesting periods of the stock options  of which  will be amortized in and the remainder through additionally  during  and  we granted options and warrants to outside consultants at fair value on the date of grant in exchange for future services 
these options and warrants are required to be accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas accounting for stock based compensation and eitf accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services and at the fair value of the consideration received  or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  whichever may be more readily measured 
as the performance of services is completed  we revalue the options and warrants that have been earned during the period 
we valued these securities at the fair value using a black scholes methodology 
during  and  in connection with the grant of these stock options and warrants to outside consultants  we recorded expenses totaling   and  respectively 
we may be required to record additional expense on a quarterly basis based upon increases in the fair value of our common stock 
please refer to note of our financial statements  stock option plans non employee options and warrants  included under part ii  item of this form k 
in august and october of  we sold series d preferred stock for net cash proceeds of million 
our series d preferred stock included a beneficial conversion feature to be calculated in accordance with eitf accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios and eitf application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments 
this resulted in a deemed dividend of  in in connection with the issuance of our series d preferred stock 
this amount increased the net loss attributable to common stockholders 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased  to million from million for in  revenue was comprised solely of the recognition of million of deferred revenue from the biovail agreement as described below 
in  our revenue was primarily comprised of million in amortization of the million fee we received on signing of the license  research and development agreement for our collaboration with biovail in january on march  we entered into a separation agreement with biovail that provided for the return of our december patent for the immediate and controlled release formulation of diltiazem and termination of the exclusive license agreement with biovail for development of the dov compound for the treatment of angina and hypertension 
as the separation agreement ends our performance obligations  we recognized the remaining deferred revenue  totaling million as of december   as revenue in the first quarter of going forward  we will not record any additional revenue from biovail for this product candidate 
royalty and licensing expense 
in connection with the termination of the biovail agreement and the return of the patent as described above  we agreed to a million payment to biovail upon signing 
this payment was to obtain the patent and related clinical data from biovail 
as this product will require fda approval prior to marketing and the patent has no alternative future use  we expensed the entire license fee 
thus in the first quarter of  we recorded an expense of million 
there was no such expense in the comparable period in research and development expense 
research and development expense for includes of the research and development expenses of dov bermuda as we are now consolidating the results of dov bermuda effective january  research and development expense increased million to million for from million for approximately million of the increase in research and development expense was attributable to increased costs associated with the clinical development for ocinaplon and bicifadine  including an increase of million in manufacturing and packaging related costs  million in toxicology costs and  in clinical trial costs 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of we paid million for the purchase of nascime limited and the product candidates  bicifadine and ocinaplon  and  for transfer taxes associated with the acquisition 
as the purchase relates to early stage technology that  in our opinion  has not yet reached technological feasibility  as the products will ultimately require regulatory approval prior to commercialization  the million purchase price was expensed as in process research and development in the fourth quarter of approximately  of the increase in research and development expense was attributable to net increased costs related to additional clinical development for our other compounds including dov  of  dov diltiazem of  and preclinical compounds of  offset by a decrease in costs for dov  of  the remaining increase in research and development expense was attributable to an increase in costs associated with payroll and overhead allocated of million  an increase in professional fees including consulting and medical writing of  and an increase in travel related expenses of  non cash compensation expense increased  general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for includes of the general and administrative expenses of dov bermuda as we are now consolidating the results of dov bermuda effective january  general and administrative expense increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased office and related expenses of  increased professional fees of  and increased payroll related costs associated with our increase in personnel of  the increase in office and related expenses was primarily related to an increase in directors and officers insurance of  an increase in costs related to operating a public company of  an increase in amortization and depreciation expense of  an increase in travel and entertainment expense of  an increase in rent expense of  and an increase of  as we expanded operations 
the increase in professional fees was primarily related to an increase in accounting fees of  an increase in recruitment fees of  and an increase in consulting fees of  offset by a decrease in legal expenses of  the increase in payroll costs was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries of  and an increase in payroll overhead of  offset by a decrease in bonuses of  and a decrease in non cash compensation expense of  loss in investment in dov bermuda 
in  loss in investment in dov bermuda represented our of the expenses of dov bermuda related to elan s formulation work for the joint venture products and administrative expenses 
as we are now consolidating the results of dov bermuda  all such expenses are now recorded in research and development expense and general and administrative expense 
interest income 
interest income decreased  to  in from million in the increase was due to lower average cash balances offset by the fact that cash proceeds from the initial public offering earned interest for eight months in versus twelve months in interest expense 
interest expense increased  to million in from million in both the elan convertible promissory note and convertible line of credit promissory note contain interest that will be paid  at elan s option  either in cash or our common stock 
in accordance with eitf  we evaluate this conversion feature each time interest is accrued on the notes 
this feature resulted in interest expense of million in  an increase of  from  due primarily to the increase in the fair value of our common stock 
to the extent the value of our common stock is at or above per share with respect to the convertible promissory note or per share with respect to the convertible line of credit promissory note  we will continue to incur additional interest expense each time interest is accrued on the notes 
this increase was accompanied by higher interest expense recorded due to higher outstanding balances  owing to accrued interest on the convertible promissory note and the convertible line of credit promissory note 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net decreased million to million in net income in from million of other expense  net in in  other income  net  consisted primarily of the million in other income attributable to the directors and officers insurance recovery discussed below  offset by a decrease in the value of warrants to acquire neurocrine common stock of  and loss on sale of securities of  following a decline in the aftermarket trading price of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering  beginning on april   a number of class action lawsuits were filed naming us as defendants  in addition to certain of our officers and directors and certain of our underwriters 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement  which was approved by the court on april   to settle these lawsuits 
in connection with the settlement  we reached an agreement with the primary carrier of our directors and officers liability insurance policy 
in that regard  our insurance carrier paid million to us in settlement of the shareholder class action lawsuits 
in  other income expense  net consisted primarily of million for settlement of the securities class action lawsuit discussed above and  of expense associated with the net decrease in the value of the warrants to acquire neurocrine common stock  which we earned in upon the achievement of a certain milestone offset by the corresponding decrease in the liability to wyeth 
income tax benefit 
in  we sold a portion of our new jersey net operating loss as part of the new jersey economic development authority technology business tax certificate program 
we recognized no such benefit in years ended december  and revenue 
our revenue was million for as compared to million for in our revenue was comprised of million of amortization of the million fee we received on signing of the license  research and development agreement for our collaboration with biovail in january and  in revenue from contract research services performed under our collaboration with biovail 
the upfront payment has been deferred and is being amortized to revenue over the estimated research and development period 
during this period was estimated to be months 
as of july   we revised this estimate to be approximately months and  accordingly  the amortization of the remaining balance beginning july  reflects this revised time period 
this adjustment to the estimate for the development period was made as a result of unexpected results obtained in a phase i pharmacokinetic study in which we discovered that a high fat meal  proximate to dosing  retarded the bioavailability of the immediate release component of the diltiazem formulation under development 
we conducted an additional phase i pharmacokinetic study in order to evaluate strategies to overcome this food effect 
this additional study delayed the initiation of the phase iii clinical trial by several months and thereby extended our total development timeline 
in  our revenue was comprised of million in license fees from biovail  a million milestone payment from neurocrine  which included million in cash and warrants to purchase shares of neurocrine s common stock valued at million  and  in revenue from contract research services performed under our collaboration with biovail 
royalty expense 
we did not incur royalty expense in the royalty expense of million for reflected wyeth s share of the milestone payment and warrants we received under our sublicense agreement with neurocrine 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased million to million for from million in approximately million of the increase in research and development expense was attributable to increased costs associated with the phase ii clinical trials and toxicology studies for ocinaplon and bicifadine  including allocated payroll and overhead of  and million was primarily attributable to increased costs for clinical trials and toxicology studies for our other compounds 
research and development expense included increased costs associated with personnel of approximately  and severance for two employees of  which includes  of a charge taken for the acceleration of certain options for the severed employees 
research and development expense included non cash  stock based compensation expense of  in and  in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased payroll costs of  increased office and related expenses of  and increased professional fees of  the increase in payroll costs was primarily attributable to increased non cash compensation expense of  and increased salaries and bonuses of  as we expanded our operations 
the increase in office and related expenses was primarily related to an increase in directors and officers liability insurance premiums of  an increase in advertising expense of  an increase in corporate taxes of  and an increase in data processing and online services of  the increase in professional fees is primarily related to an increase in accounting related expenses of  offset by a net decrease in various other professional fees of  general and administrative expense included non cash  stock based compensation expense of  in and  in loss in investment in dov bermuda 
loss in investment in dov bermuda decreased  to million in from million in the decrease resulted primarily from decreased costs associated with formulation development work for ocinaplon and bicifadine performed by elan 
interest income 
interest income increased  to million in from  in the increase was due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents in resulting from the million of net proceeds received from our initial public offering  offset by lower average interest rate yields in interest expense 
interest expense increased  to million in from million in  primarily attributable to our convertible promissory note and convertible line of credit promissory note with elan 
approximately  of the increase was due to the impact of higher outstanding balances on the convertible promissory note and the convertible line of credit promissory note 
both the elan convertible promissory note and convertible line of credit promissory note contain interest that will  at elan s option  be paid either in cash or our common stock 
in accordance with eitf  we evaluate this conversion feature each time interest is accrued on the notes 
this feature resulted in additional interest expense of million for  an increase of  from to the extent the value of our common stock is at or above per share with respect to the convertible promissory note or per share with respect to the convertible line of credit promissory note  we will continue to incur additional interest expense each time interest is accrued on the particular note 
other income expense  net 
other income and expense net decreased million from a net income of  in to a net expense of million in in  other income expense  net consisted primarily of million in a reserve for settlement of a securities class action lawsuit discussed below and  of expense associated with the net decrease in the value of the warrants to acquire neurocrine common stock  which we earned in upon the achievement of a certain milestone offset by the corresponding decrease in the liability to wyeth 
in  other income  net consisted primarily of a net increase of  in value of the neurocrine warrants 
following a decline in the aftermarket trading price of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering  beginning on april   a number of class action lawsuits were filed naming us as defendants  in addition to certain of our officers and directors and certain of our underwriters 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement  which was approved by the court on april   to settle these lawsuits 
based on the terms of the settlement agreement  we determined that a liability related to these actions was probable and that the value was reasonably estimable 
accordingly  as of december   we established an estimate for the cost of the litigation settlement of million  with million representing our estimate of the liability for the fair value of the warrants 
we estimated the fair value of the warrants using a black scholes methodology 
significant assumptions included our closing stock price as of december  of per share and a volatility factor of based on the day volatility as reported by bloomberg for the days ended december  the fair value of the warrants fluctuated based on many factors  including  but not limited to  the fair value of our common stock and the volatility in our common stock 
the majority of the value in the liability at december   relates to our current stock price  the term of the warrants and the fact that our common stock is volatile 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  in we have paid the class members inclusive of their attorneys fees and costs  in cash and issued them six year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share 
upon issuance in june  the value of the warrants was determined to be million 
liquidity and capital resources for the three years ended december   and  we funded our operations principally from sales of our equity securities and option and warrant exercises  which provided cash in the aggregate amount of approximately million  and license and cash milestone revenues in the aggregate amount of million 
sales of our equity securities have resulted in the receipt of net cash proceeds of million from the sale of our common stock to a group of funds led by orbimed advisors  llc in july  million from the sale of our common stock in april  and million from the sale of our series d preferred stock in august and october at december   our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million compared with million at december  at december   we had working capital of million 
net cash used in operations during the year ended december  amounted to million  as compared to million in the increase in cash used in operations resulted primarily from the increase in clinical development activities and the addition of personnel as we expanded operations 
non cash expenses related to stock based compensation  interest expense and depreciation and amortization expenses were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
non cash amortization of premium paid on marketable securities and depreciation in the value of investments was million and  net in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements until at least the end of our convertible promissory note and our convertible line of credit promissory note mature on january   at which time the principal amount and unpaid accrued interest become due and payable 
at anytime prior to the date either of the notes are paid in full  the holders of the notes have the right to convert the outstanding principal and unpaid accrued interest amount of the convertible promissory note and the convertible line of credit promissory note into shares of our common stock at per share and per share  respectively 
if in january the note holders choose to have the notes repaid in cash  we will be required to pay them approximately million and if we have not raised additional capital  to curtail operations until we raise additional capital 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors  including our progress with research and development  our ability to establish and the scope of any new collaborations  the progress and success of clinical trials and preclinical studies of our product candidates  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and the note holders choice of having the notes repaid in cash or converting the notes into our common stock 
in addition to the foregoing  our future capital uses and requirements are also dependent in part on the ability of our licensees and collaborative partners to meet their obligations to us  including the fulfillment of their development and commercialization responsibilities in respect of our product candidates 
our sublicensee and collaborative partners  neurocrine and pfizer  may encounter conflicts of interest  changes in business strategy or other business issues  or they may acquire or develop rights to competing products  all of which could adversely affect their ability or willingness to fulfill their obligations to us and  consequently  require us to satisfy  through the commitment of additional funds or personnel or both  any shortfalls in their performance 
to meet future capital requirements  we may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative agreements with corporate partners or from other sources 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail or delay significantly one or more of our product development programs 
in addition  future milestone payments under some of our collaborative or license agreements are contingent upon our meeting particular research or development goals 
the amount and timing of future milestone payments are contingent upon the terms of each collaborative or license agreement 
milestone performance criteria are specific to each agreement and based upon future performance 
therefore  we are subject to significant variation in the timing and amount of our revenues  milestone expenses and results of operations from period to period 
contractual obligations future minimum payments for all contractual obligations for years subsequent to december   are as follows years ended december  thereafter total in thousands convertible promissory note convertible line of credit promissory note operating leases total the table above excludes future milestones and royalties which may be owed to wyeth  elan and biovail under terms of existing agreements as payments are contingent upon future events 
we do not expect to pay any milestones  or royalties under these agreements in in may  we licensed from wyeth  on an exclusive  worldwide basis  indiplon  bicifadine  ocinaplon and dov  for any indication  including insomnia  pain  anxiety and depression 
we have the right to develop and commercialize these compounds  including the right to grant sublicenses to third parties  subject to wyeth s right of first refusal 
subject to the reorganization referred to below  we are obligated to pay wyeth minimum royalties of of net sales for indiplon  ocinaplon and dov  and of net sales for bicifadine  and milestones of million for indiplon  million for each of ocinaplon and dov  and million for bicifadine upon a nda filing and  if we sublicense the compounds we are then obligated to pay wyeth up to of any payments we received from that compound 
in february  we entered into agreements to reorganize the license and sublicense agreements with wyeth and neurocrine  which upon closing  among other things will alter our financial obligations to wyeth set forth above 
for a more complete description of these pending arrangements  please see part i  item business in licenses 
in february we entered into a third amendment to our existing office lease agreement for additional office space and extending our overall lease term to june the new agreement increases our commitments in by  and in by  for a total of  recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued statement number accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
this statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas generally requires liability classification for two broad classes of financial instruments instruments that represent  or are indexed to  an obligation to buy back the issuer s shares  and obligations that can be settled in shares  but are subject to certain conditions 
sfas is generally effective to all financial instruments created or modified after may   and to other instruments at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after july  in november  fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fss which deferred the effective dates for applying certain provisions of sfas related to mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain non public entities and certain mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests for public and non public companies 
for public entities  sfas is effective for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and is effective for all other financial instruments as of the first interim period beginning after june  for mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests that would not have to be classified as liabilities by a subsidiary under the exception in paragraph of sfas  but would be classified as liabilities by the parent  the classification and measurement provisions of sfas are deferred indefinitely 
the measurement provisions of sfas are also deferred indefinitely for other mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests that were issued before november  for those instruments  the measurement guidance for redeemable shares and non controlling interests in other literature shall apply during the deferral period 
we adopted the provisions of sfas effective june  and unless new transactions are entered into  sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb reissued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
with certain modifications and clarifications 
application of this guidance was effective for interests in certain variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities and for variable interest entities created or acquired after february  as of december  application for all other types of variable interest entities created after february  is required for the period ended after march  unless previously applied 
adoption of the revised interpretation of fin is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
collaboration and license agreements 
revenue from up front payments  technology license fees and milestone payments received for the delivery of products and services representing the culmination of a separate earnings process is recognized when due and the amounts are judged to be collectible 
revenue from up front payments  technology license fees and milestone payments received in connection with other rights and services  which represent continuing obligations to us  is deferred and recognized over the term of the continuing obligation 
historically  the recognition of revenue for such an up front payment included an estimate by management as to the development period that such up front payments were associated 
research and development 
research and development costs are expensed when incurred and include allocations for payroll and related costs and other corporate overhead 
costs assigned to assets to be used in a particular research and development project that have no alternative further use are charged to expenses as in process research and development expense as of the date of consummation 
stock based compensation 
in general  we grant stock options to employees for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize no compensation expense on these employee stock option grants 
prior to our common stock becoming publicly traded  we granted stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize the difference between the exercise price and fair market value as compensation expense  which is recognized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the stock options 
we also have  in the past  granted options and warrants to outside consultants at fair value on the date of grant in exchange for future services 
these options and warrants are required to be accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas accounting for stock based compensation and eitf accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services at the fair value of the consideration received  or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  whichever may be more readily measured 
as the performance of services is completed  we revalue the options and warrants that have been earned during the period 
we value these securities at the fair value using a black scholes methodology 
liabilities 
having reached a settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the securities class action lawsuits as described in note to our financial statements included under part ii  item of this form k  we determined that a liability related to these actions was probable and that the value was reasonably estimable 
the settlement  which was approved by the court on april   called for a payment by us of  and the issuance of  six year warrants exercisable at per share 
accordingly  as of december   we established an estimate for the cost of the litigation settlement of million  with million representing our estimate of the liability for the fair value of the warrants 
the warrants were issued in june and we are no longer required to revalue the liability for the warrants 
upon issuance  we determined the fair value of the warrants at million and recorded the warrants as stockholders equity 
income taxes 
we have net deferred tax assets at december  that are totally offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that the criteria for recognition have not been met 
we believe that a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will continue to be required if losses are reported in future periods 
if  as a result of profitable operations  we determine that we are able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  increasing income or decreasing loss in the period in which such a determination is made 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenues  earnings  financial position and various disclosures 
we base our estimates on circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
our significant accounting policies are also described in note to our financial statements included under part ii  item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s to date  we have invested our cash balances with significant financial institutions 
in the future  the primary objective of our investment activities will be to maximize the income we receive from our investments consistent with preservation of principal and minimum risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and corporate obligations 
due to the short holding period of these types of investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material financial market risk exposure 
in addition to our investment portfolio of our cash balances  at december  we also had an investment in neurocrine warrants 
the investment balance of million at december   includes warrants we received from neurocrine under our sublicense agreement 
we had a corresponding accrued royalty of  for  included in accrued expenses related to the portion of the neurocrine warrants we must remit to wyeth under our license agreement 
as the warrants represent a derivative financial instrument under sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  both the asset and the liability to wyeth were reflected in our financial statements at fair value and we recorded an adjustment to those fair values at the end of each reporting period with the corresponding gain or loss reflected in other income or other expense 
included in other expense  net for and was  and  respectively  for the net decrease in the value of the warrants offset by the decrease in the liability 
we calculated these values using a black scholes methodology 
the majority of the value in the asset at december   relates to the term of the warrants and the fact that neurocrine s common stock is volatile 
in april  we sold the neurocrine warrants and common stock remaining in the investment account for  as such we are no longer subject to market risk for this transaction 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement  which was approved by the court on april   to settle class action lawsuits that had been filed against us on behalf of purchasers of our common stock in or traceable to our initial public offering 
we paid to the class members inclusive of their attorneys fees and costs  and issued  six year warrants to purchase our common stock exercisable at per share 
based on the terms of the settlement agreement  we determined that a liability related to these actions was probable and that the value was reasonably estimable 
as of december   we established an estimate for the cost of the litigation settlement of million  with million representing our estimate of the liability for the fair value of the warrants 
on june   we issued the warrants and determined the liability for the fair value of the warrants to be million 
we determined the fair value of the warrants using a black scholes methodology 
the majority of the value in the liability related to our current stock price  the term of the warrants and the volatility of our common stock 
we have recorded the issuance of the warrants as stockholders equity in accordance with eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock and we are no longer required to revalue the liability for the warrants after june
