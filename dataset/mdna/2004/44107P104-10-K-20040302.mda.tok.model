item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in forward looking statements and risk factors contained elsewhere in this report 
overview structure and business 
we are a real estate investment trust  or reit  that owns full service hotel properties as of february   which operate primarily in the luxury and upper upscale hotel sectors 
as of december   host marriott was the largest hotel reit in the national association of real estate investment trust s composite index 
host marriott conducts its operations through host lp  of which host marriott is the sole general partner 
our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry including marriott  ritz carlton  hyatt  four seasons  hilton and westin 
the majority of our properties are located in central business districts of major cities  near airports and in resort convention locations 
the target profile for our portfolio includes luxury and upper upscale full service properties in locations where further large scale development is limited  which we believe allows us to maintain room rate and occupancy premiums over our competitors 
we seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management  by directing the managers of our hotels to maximize property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements 
the majority of our customers fall into two broad groups transient and group travelers 
our transient business  which includes the individual corporate and leisure traveler  is generally accommodated at a premium rate when compared to other customer types 
group business includes hotel bookings related to conferences and events 
a smaller portion of our customer base results from contracts for a specified number of rooms over a fixed period 
our hotels are required to be operated by third party managers 
we retain these third party managers under long term agreements under which they earn base and incentive management fees related to revenues and profitability of each individual hotel 
we provide operating funds  or working capital  which the managers use to operate the property including purchasing inventory and paying wages  utilities and property taxes and other expenses 
our results of operations primarily represent hotel level sales  which are room  food and beverage and other ancillary income such as telephone  parking and other guest services 
operating expenses consist of the costs to provide these services  as well as management fees paid to the operators of our hotels  real and personal property taxes  utilities  ground rent  equipment rent  property insurance  depreciation and other costs 
we generally receive a cash distribution  which reflects hotel level sales less property level operating expenses excluding depreciation  from our hotel managers each period 
key performance indicators we have several key indicators that we use to evaluate the performance of our business 
these indicators include room revenue per available room  or revpar  and revpar penetration index 
revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include revenues from food and beverage or parking  telephone  or other guest services generated by the property 
although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
we also use revpar to compare the results of our hotels between periods and to compare results of our comparable hotels 
see comparable hotel operating statistics for further discussion 
we assess what causes changes in revpar because changes that result from occupancy as compared to those that result from room rate have different implications on overall revenue levels as well as incremental operating profit 
for example  increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in ancillary revenues  such as food and beverage  parking sand other hotel amenities  as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
revpar increases due to higher room rates  however  would not result in these additional room related costs 
for this reason  while operating profit would typically increase when occupancy rises  revpar increases due to higher room rates would have a greater impact on our profitability 
a related revenue measure for our hotels is the revpar penetration index 
the revpar penetration index reflects each property s revpar in relation to the revpar for that property s competitive set 
we use the measure as an indicator of a property s market share 
for example  a revpar penetration index of would indicate that a hotel s revpar is  on average  the same as its competitors 
a revpar penetration index exceeding would indicate that a hotel maintains a revpar premium in relation to its competitive set  while a revpar penetration index below would be an indicator that a hotel is underperforming its competitive set 
one critical component in this calculation is the determination of a hotel s competitive set 
factors that we consider include geographic proximity  as well as the level of service provided at the property 
for example  a hotel located near a convention center might have a competitive set that includes other hotels located in close proximity to the convention center 
in addition  a luxury hotel might include other luxury or upper upscale hotels in its competitive set but not economy hotels 
our methodology for determining a hotel s competitive set  however  may differ from those used by other owners and or managers 
one of our key performance indicators is the profitability of each hotel 
among other things  we use hotel adjusted operating profit  which is a non gaap measure  to evaluate this 
hotel adjusted operating profit measures property level results before funding furniture  fixtures and equipment reserves and debt service and is a supplemental measure of individual property level profitability 
the comparable hotel adjusted operating profit that we discuss is an aggregation of the adjusted operating profit for each of our comparable hotels 
see non gaap financial measures comparable hotel operating results for further discussion 
we also use  among other things  ffo per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company wide profitability 
see non gaap financial measures ffo per diluted share for further discussion 
each of the non gaap measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues  operating profit and earnings per share 
and lodging industry assessment we believe the lodging industry was negatively effected in by low levels of business travel resulting from a weak economy predominantly in the first half of the year  the war in iraq  continued changes in terrorist threat levels and travel reductions and restrictions related to severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars 
strong economic growth in the united states economy in the second half of helped improve lodging demand  but generally not enough to offset the weak lodging demand in the first half 
our industry outlook for is more optimistic 
historically  we have seen that lodging demand in the united states correlates to us gross domestic product gdp growth  with typically a one to two quarter lag period especially within the luxury and upper upscale sectors of the lodging industry 
therefore  given the relatively strong us gdp growth in the second half of and the forecasts for  we are optimistic about improvement in lodging demand in in addition  based on these gdp forecasts  as well as the anticipated strengthening of corporate profits and capital investment  we expect an increase in business related travel and improvement in the pace of group bookings 
in addition to the favorable demand trends forecasted to affect the lodging industry in general  we believe we may be able to capitalize on the low supply growth trends that have existed during the past few years 
supply growth in the lodging industry and the markets in which we operate may be influenced by a number of factors  including growth of the economy  interest rates  local considerations and the relatively long lead time required to build urban and resort convention hotels 
historically  supply growth has averaged approximately per year 
however  since the growth of new supply for the entire lodging industry has exhibited a declining trend below the historic average    and in   and  respectively based on data prepared by smith travel research and pricewaterhousecoopers llp 
the upper upscale segment experienced stronger supply growth than did the industry as a whole during this period  but also exhibited a declining trend    and in   and  respectively 
we believe that the low construction levels over the past few years  together with low expectations for additional supply growth over the next few years  which is because new full service hotels typically take several years to build  will lead to an imbalance between supply and growing demand that will allow for improved revpar performance at our hotels 
in  our hotel revenues as presented in our statement of operations declined from as a result of the factors discussed above 
however  because accounting rules require us to reclassify the results of operations of hotels we have sold or designated as held for sale to discontinued operations  the decrease in revenues was actually higher 
hotel sales  including the results of hotels acquired or disposed of during and through the date of their respective disposition or acquisition  declined  which follows a similar decline of in from hotel revenues were also down in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  but the decline in revenues was less than the decline in the first three quarters of in response to the decline in operations of our hotels over the last several years  we have been working with our managers to achieve cost reductions at our properties 
we believe these efforts have slowed the decline in the operating margins of our hotels and should create some long term efficiencies 
however  in  our operating margins declined further because significant components of our costs  such as employee wages and benefits  property taxes  insurance and utilities increased at a rate greater than inflation 
in addition  other costs  such as property taxes are relatively inflexible and tend to remain somewhat constant regardless of any reduction in hotel property revenues 
as a result  a change in our revenues usually results in a greater percentage change in our earnings and cash flows 
during  the average revpar penetration index  or market share  for our comparable hotels modestly declined  but it remains at a premium in relation to our competitive set 
we believe that this decline in market share occurred because our hotels generally have a higher percentage of their revenues generated by corporate group and corporate transient customers than their competitors and the corporate group and transient business were among the poorest performing sectors in  the managers of many of our hotels were anticipating an improvement in corporate business in the second half of  leading them to turn down lower rated business that was ultimately not replaced with the anticipated higher rated business  our hotels generally have a lower percentage of their revenues generated by leisure travelers than their competitors and the leisure business was among the best performing sectors in  and certain of our managers did not fully access internet distribution channels until early  which generally resulted in fewer internet bookings than our competitors 
as lodging demand continues to grow and  in particular  as corporate group and corporate transient business strengthens  we believe that our hotels will regain the majority of the market share lost in for  we expect revpar to increase to for our comparable hotels 
we also expect certain of our costs  such as wages  benefits and insurance  to continue to increase at a rate greater than inflation  which will likely result in flat operating margins for while we believe the combination of improved demand trends and low supply growth trends in the lodging industry and our strategic cost reductions create the possibility for improvements in our business in  there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will be achieved 
the trends discussed above may not occur for any number of reasons  including slower than anticipated growth in the economy  changes in travel patterns and the continued threat of additional terrorist attacks  all of which may result in lower revenues or higher operating costs and declining operating margins 
management s priorities based on our primary business objectives and forecasted operating conditions  our key priorities  or financial strategies  over the next several years include the following to acquire upper upscale and luxury hotels in unique locations where further large scale development is limited for prospective competitors  including hotels located in urban and resort convention locations  to use the proceeds from the sale of non core hotels that do not fit within our business strategy of owning upper upscale and luxury properties in urban and resort convention locations  to acquire properties more closely aligned to our profile or repay debt including up to million in senior notes as specifically permitted by our board of directors in november  to implement selective capital improvements designed to increase profitability and direct our managers to minimize operating costs and increase revenues  to invest capital in our existing portfolio where the return on investment is favorable 
potential investments at our hotels could include increasing the number of rooms  adding a spa  fitness facility  convention or meeting space or upgrading the infrastructure  such as energy efficient heating and cooling systems  and to reduce our leverage to achieve an interest coverage ratio of x or greater under our senior notes indenture  thereby lifting the restrictions which generally prohibit us from incurring additional debt or paying dividends above the minimum amount required to maintain host marriott s reit status 
as we discussed previously  our acquisition efforts to acquire new properties over the past several years have been limited by several factors  including a lack of suitable targets that complement our portfolio and capital limitations due to weak equity markets 
similarly  we have limited our capital expenditures the past two years based on our assessment of the operating environment and to preserve capital 
as a result  management has focused its priorities more on recycling capital and improving our overall leverage and financial covenants by selling non core hotels and using the proceeds to refinance or retire outstanding debt 
for further detail on steps we have taken to meet our objectives  see the discussion in liquidity and capital resources debt repayment and refinancing and liquidity and capital resources cash provided by or used in investing activities 
results of operations the following table reflects key line items from our audited statements of operations and other significant operating statistics in millions  except operating statistics and percentages change to change to revenues total hotel sales operating costs and expenses property level costs corporate and other expenses operating profit interest expense minority interest expense income from discontinued operations net income loss other operating statistics comparable hotel revpar n a comparable average room rate n a comparable average occupancy pts 
n a pts 
amount represents operating costs and expenses per our statements of operations less corporate and other expenses 
compared to as previously discussed  our hotel sales declined  however  due to the reclassification of the results of assets sold or designated as held for sale to discontinued operations  hotel revenues on our statement of operations only declined for full year  principally due to the decline in room sales of 
for  our comparable hotel revpar of was down from  reflecting a decline in average room rate of and a decrease in occupancy of percentage points  primarily due to reduced transient demand for both business and leisure travel 
beginning in the fourth quarter  demand began to improve relative to the first three quarters of  with less than one half a percent decrease in room rate and a slight decrease in occupancy over the fourth quarter of while we have begun to see a general increase in demand  the weakest component of our business continues to be the higher rated individual transient business traveler which historically has paid the highest average room rates 
our managers have partially offset this decline with additional group and contract business that has resulted in lower average room rates 
while our overall results for declined  we did experience improvements in comparable hotel revpar in four geographic regions for the fourth quarter and two regions for the full year 
comparable hotel revpar for our washington dc metro region increased for the fourth quarter and for the full year 
these increases were driven by strong transient demand particularly at our northern virginia properties as occupancy increased percentage points for both the fourth quarter and full year for the comparable hotels 
our florida region also had a slight increase in comparable hotel revpar for the year  but a slight decrease for the fourth quarter 
the results were primarily driven by our properties in the ft 
lauderdale and tampa markets  which benefited from stronger group demand and leisure travel 
the relative improvement of these regions was offset by the overall decline in comparable hotel revpar in most of our regions 
in particular  our new england and south central regions had significant declines in comparable hotel revpar of and  respectively  for the year and and  respectively  for the fourth quarter 
the comparable hotel results in the south central region were primarily affected by our hotels in san antonio where full year occupancy was down percentage points and average room rate declined 
the decrease in demand was primarily attributable to a reduction in city wide convention activity in the decline in our new england properties was driven by the performance of our three comparable hotels in boston which had comparable hotel revpar declines of and  respectively  for the fourth quarter and full year 
the new england results discussed above do not include the boston copley marriott which is considered a non comparable hotel  which had an increase in revpar for the fourth quarter of 
our rental income represents lease income from our limited service hotels and three office property leases  as well as lease income from one full service hotel 
operations at the leased limited service hotel properties continued to suffer due to increased competition from full service and limited service properties and weak economic conditions in their markets  resulting in a very competitive environment and lower room rates 
we expect that there will be slower improvement in these properties in than in our full service properties  in part  because a significant portion of these limited service properties will be undergoing renovation in to enable them to compete with the newer supply in the future  which will result in a decrease in the number of available rooms in while these renovations are underway 
in  we also recognized million of other income from the settlement of a claim that we brought against our directors and officers insurance carriers for reimbursement of defense costs and settlement payments incurred in resolving a series of related actions brought against us and marriott international which arose from the sale of certain limited partnerships units to investors prior to operating costs and expenses 
the increase in operating costs and expenses is primarily the result of increases in wages  benefits  insurance and utilities at our hotels 
rental and other expense for our limited service hotel leases  office properties and one full service hotel that we leased are included in other property level expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
consistent with the relatively fixed nature of these costs  our operating expenses increased in both and despite the decrease in revenues in both years 
we expect that costs such as wages  benefits and insurance will continue to increase at a rate greater than inflation 
corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and other costs such as stock based employee compensation expense  corporate insurance  audit fees  building rent and system costs 
the increase in corporate and other expenses is primarily due to increases in corporate insurance and the appreciation of host marriott s stock price  which affects the stock based employee compensation expense 
interest expense 
interest expense increased over as a result of the payment of aggregate call premiums of million and the acceleration of deferred financing fees of million associated with the prepayment of our senior notes and various mortgages during in  we expect that as a result of the retirement of approximately million of debt including million retired in january that interest expense will decrease  however we will continue to incur additional expenses such as call premiums and the acceleration of deferred financing to the extent that we prepay or refinance our debt prior to its original maturity 
loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts 
the loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts is due primarily to the approximate million loss from the forward currency exchange contracts for our four canadian hotels being deemed ineffective for accounting purposes 
see liquidity and capital resources debt and effect of financial covenants mortgage debt covenants for further discussion 
minority interest income expense 
minority interest income expense consists of our minority partners share of the income or loss in consolidated hotel partnerships and the approximate percentage ownership in host lp 
the change from in minority interest primarily reflects earnings in the current year  primarily as a result of the gain on the settlement of the world trade center hotel  compared to a net loss in equity in earnings losses of affiliates 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates consists of our portion of the earnings losses of two partnerships in which we own non controlling interests and do not consolidate in our financial statements 
the increase in the loss can be attributed to an increase in the net loss of cbm joint venture llc in see investments in affiliates for a discussion of this partnership 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations consists of the eight hotels sold in and one hotel sold in  the gain on the disposition and business interruption proceeds for the new york marriott world trade center hotel and five properties classified as held for sale as of december   three of which were sold in january in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas  the results of operations for these properties in the current year and prior periods are reflected in discontinued operations 
for  the eight hotels sold generated net proceeds of approximately million with a net gain on disposition of approximately million  which includes a million gain on the disposition of world trade center hotel 
for and  our revenues for these eight properties and the new york marriott world trade center were million and million  respectively  and our income before taxes was million and million  respectively 
the st 
louis marriott pavilion was transferred to the mortgage lender in january in a non cash transaction and we recognized a net gain of million  primarily as a result of the debt extinguished and the forgiveness of management fees net of the fair value of the assets surrendered 
for and  revenues for the five properties classified as held for sale were million and million  respectively  and our income before taxes was million and million  respectively 
on december   we announced the settlement of the outstanding matters relating to the terrorist attacks of september  affecting the new york marriott world trade center and financial center hotels with the hotels insurer  marriott international  inc and the port authority of new york and new jersey 
as a result of these settlements  we received net insurance proceeds of approximately million 
as a result of this settlement  we recorded a one time gain of approximately million  which is comprised of approximately million in post business interruption proceeds and approximately million from the disposition of the world trade center hotel 
the gain on disposition and the and business interruption income  net of expenses  related to the hotel has been reclassified to discontinued operations 
the business interruption proceeds received  net of expenses  for the new york marriott financial center hotel are included in rooms revenues from continuing operations 
compared to revenues 
hotel revenues declined for full year principally due to the decline in room sales of 
as discussed previously  revenues as presented in our statements of operations do not reflect the actual decline in revenues because of the reclassification of the results of assets sold or designated as held for sale to discontinued operations 
actual room sales decreased in from for  our comparable hotel revpar of was down  which was comprised of a decline in average room rate of and a decrease in occupancy of percentage points 
the decline in comparable hotel revpar was primarily attributable to reduced transient demand for business and leisure travel 
while the decrease in comparable hotel revpar is due in part to the reduction in business and leisure travel  it is also the result of the change in business mix at our properties 
transient business  which includes corporate and premium business travelers  which generally pay the highest average room rates has decreased by over since as a percentage of room sales 
our managers have partially offset this decline with additional group and contract business that have lower average room rates 
as a result  while occupancy increased slightly  the average room rate declined significantly 
although most regions had comparable hotel revpar declines in line with our overall portfolio  we did have two regions that had stronger results 
our south central region comparable hotel revpar declined by only primarily due to strong results from our three san antonio hotels 
the mid atlantic region also outperformed the overall portfolio with a comparable hotel revpar decline of 
this was due to positive comparable hotel revpar at our philadelphia convention center marriott and four seasons  philadelphia properties  offset by declines at our suburban properties in this region 
the pacific region had the largest comparable hotel revpar decline at 
these results were largely due to the collapse of the technology market in the san francisco area with all our hotels in that market having revpar declines 
the north central region also had declines in comparable hotel revpar of  which was a function of poor results in most of the region with our chicago and minneapolis properties reporting significant declines 
our rental income further declined primarily due to increased competition and weak economic conditions for the leased limited service hotels 
operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses decreased primarily as a result of our efforts and those of our managers to control operating costs at the hotels and the overall decline in occupancy 
rental expense for our limited service hotels and office properties are included in other property level expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
these costs  which include wages  benefits and insurance  increased at a rate greater than inflation throughout the year 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses decreased principally due to a decrease in stock based compensation 
as a result of the decline in host marriott s stock price and our operations in  certain performance thresholds were not met and a portion of the shares previously granted were forfeited 
minority interest expense 
the variance in minority interest expense was due to the decrease in our results of operations as described above 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates 
the decrease in equity in earnings losses of affiliates can be primarily attributed to an increase in the net loss of cbm joint venture llc 
see investments in affiliates for a discussion of this partnership 
discontinued operations 
during january  we transferred the st 
louis marriott pavilion to the mortgage lender in a non cash transaction 
we recorded a gain  net of taxes  of million in and a loss from operations of million in as discontinued operations 
we also reclassified the operations from properties disposed of in and properties classified as held for sale in as discontinued operations in and for and  revenues for these properties were million and million and our income before taxes was million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements host marriott is required to distribute to its stockholders at least of its taxable income in order to qualify as a reit 
because we are required to distribute almost all of our taxable income  we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth  including acquisitions 
cash balances 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  which was an increase of million from december  over the past two years our cash balances have been in excess of the million to million  which we had historically maintained 
we expect to reduce our cash balance through the repayment of indebtedness  the acquisition of additional hotels and further investments in our portfolio 
cash increased for the year principally as a result of our settlement of outstanding matters relating to our new york marriott world trade center and financial center hotels for net proceeds of approximately million  the sale of eight hotels for net proceeds of approximately million and host marriott s two equity offerings for net proceeds of approximately million  the proceeds of which were contributed to host lp 
as described in more detail below  cash was used principally for debt repayments  regularly scheduled principal payments and the acquisition of the hyatt regency maui resort and spa 
in addition  we have million of cash  which is restricted as a result of lender restrictions including reserves for debt service  real estate taxes  insurance  furniture and fixtures  as well as cash collateral and excess cash flow deposits 
the restricted cash balances do not have a significant effect on our liquidity 
we also currently have million of availability under our credit facility and have no amounts outstanding under the facility 
debt repayments and refinancings 
proceeds from the sale of eight hotels in  combined with the insurance settlement proceeds from the new york world trade center and financial center hotels and scheduled principal payments  enabled us to repay or redeem a total of approximately million of debt in and million of debt in january in addition  we refinanced approximately million of our debt in  lowering our average interest rate to and extending our debt maturities 
the refinancing and repayment of this debt will result in an annual reduction in interest expense of approximately million 
we have approximately million of our mortgage debt maturing through december  additionally  during we will have million of regularly scheduled principal payments on our mortgage debt 
we believe we have sufficient cash to deal with our near term debt maturities  as well as any decline in the cash flow from our business 
reducing future cash interest payments and our leverage remains a key management priority 
in november  host marriott s board of directors authorized us to purchase or retire up to million of our senior notes million of which remains outstanding after the january repayment of million of series c senior notes 
as a result  we may continue to redeem or refinance additional senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time with proceeds from additional asset sales or to take advantage of favorable market conditions 
we may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  a tender offer or  in some cases  through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms 
repurchases of debt  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and ffo per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing fees 
for example  during and the period from january  through february   we incurred interest expense resulting from the payment of call premiums and the acceleration of deferred financing fees totaling million and million  respectively for those periods 
capital expenditures 
we reduced our capital expenditures over the past two years because of the uncertain economic environment and our need to conserve cash 
for  total capital expenditures for our existing properties were approximately million 
typically  we spend approximately million to million annually on renewals and replacements and other capital improvements 
we spent approximately million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures in  reflecting our decision to delay certain projects due to the start of the war in iraq 
several of these projects have now begun and should be completed by the first quarter of capital expenditures were and of hotel sales for and  respectively 
we expect renewal and replacement capital expenditures for to be approximately million to million including approximately million of projects which were in progress at december   but were not fully funded  the vast majority of which would be funded by the furniture  fixture and equipment reserves established at our hotels typically funded annually with of property revenues and  to a lesser extent by our available cash 
as of december   our furniture  fixture and equipment reserves totaled approximately million 
as a result of the challenging environment in  we spent approximately million on return on investment projects 
in  we currently estimate that we will increase our spending on return on investment projects to approximately million as we are in the early stages of several large scale repositioning projects 
in addition  we spent million on the million  room expansion of the memphis marriott  which we expect to complete in acquisitions 
we remain interested in pursuing single asset and portfolio acquisitions and believe that there will be opportunities over the next several years to acquire assets that are consistent with our target profile of upper upscale and luxury properties in urban and resort convention locations where further large scale development is limited  such as the hyatt regency maui resort and spa  which we purchased for approximately million in the fourth quarter of we are currently in preliminary discussions with other sellers of hotels that meet our investment objectives  but have not entered into any definitive agreements 
any additional acquisitions may be funded  in part  from the proceeds of equity offerings by host marriott or the issuance of op units by host lp  as well as proceeds from asset sales and available cash 
because we are generally restricted in our ability to incur new debt as discussed herein  we generally will not finance any acquisitions through the issuance of debt securities until our ebitda to interest coverage is x or greater 
we cannot be certain as to the size or timing of acquisition opportunities or of our ability to obtain additional acquisition financing  if needed 
sources and uses of cash our principal sources of cash are cash from operations  the sale of assets  borrowings under our credit facility and our ability to obtain additional financing through various capital markets 
our principal uses of cash are debt repayments  capital expenditures  asset acquisitions  operating costs  corporate expenses and distributions to our equity holders 
cash provided by operations 
cash provided by operations decreased from million in to million in the decrease in cash provided by operations in primarily reflects the overall reduction in hotel operating profit 
additionally  the cash provided by operations included a one time  million payment from marriott international related to negotiated changes in our management agreements with respect to working capital balances at our hotels 
previously  we had recorded this amount in our balance sheet as due from managers 
there was no income statement impact of this payment 
cash provided by or used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities decreased from million in to million in activity for primarily included net proceeds of million from the sale of eight hotels  property insurance proceeds of million for the new york world trade center hotel  the acquisition of the hyatt regency maui resort and spa for million  and capital expenditures of million as discussed above in capital expenditures 
the cash used in investing activities included a one time million payment from marriott international related to negotiated changes in our management agreements with respect to furniture  fixture and equipment escrow funds for our hotels 
there was no income statement impact of this payment from marriott international

investment price includes the assumption of million of mortgage debt 
as discussed previously  we continue to pursue opportunities to dispose of non core assets and expect to complete the sale of two additional non core properties by the end of the first quarter of similar to the hotels already sold in and the four properties disposed of in the first quarter of  the hotels currently under contract for sale are generally smaller hotels in secondary markets with lower growth prospects 
we believe that  if consummated  sales of non core properties could result in proceeds of up to million in if the proceeds from these sales are used to retire debt  operating profit will decrease  but net income may improve based on the amount of the reduction in future interest payments 
similarly  if these funds are used to purchase new hotels or reinvest in existing hotels  future operating profit and net income may improve 
however  there can be no assurance that operating profit or net income will improve 
cash used in and provided by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities for was million  compared to cash used in financing activities of million for significant financing activities during included two separate issuances of common stock by host marriott totaling million shares for net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds were contributed to host lp which used a significant portion of the proceeds to finance the acquisition of the hyatt regency maui resort and spa 
host lp also issued million in series j senior notes due in the net proceeds were used to redeem million of our existing series a senior notes due in and million of our series c senior notes due in on december  the terms of the series a and c senior notes required that we pay a premium in exchange for the right to retire this debt in advance of its maturity date 
in conjunction with the redemption  we recorded a loss of approximately million for the payment of the premium and the acceleration of the related deferred financing fees in the fourth quarter of during december  we announced the settlement of all outstanding matters related to the new york marriott world trade center and financial center hotels with our insurer  marriott international and the port authority of new york and new jersey 
as a result of this settlement  we received net proceeds of approximately million  substantially all of which were used to repay debt 
during the fourth quarter  we used the proceeds to repay the million mortgage debt on the world trade center hotel and made a partial prepayment of million of mortgage debt on our canadian properties 
the remainder of the proceeds was used in the first quarter of for a partial prepayment of million of debt secured by mortgages on two ritz carlton properties and to retire the remaining outstanding series c senior notes of approximately million 
in conjunction with the redemption of the series c senior notes  we will record a loss of approximately million for the payment of the call premium and the acceleration of the related deferred financing fees in the first quarter of the following table summarizes significant financing activity  except for the credit facility  payment of distributions and non cash equity and derivative transactions completed since the beginning of fiscal year in millions transaction date description of transaction transaction amount january retired a total of million of series c senior notes january partial prepayment of the ritz carlton  naples and buckhead mortgage loan december partial prepayment of the canadian mortgage loan december retired a total of million of series a and c senior notes december repayment of world trade center hotel debt november issuance of series j senior notes due in october issuance of million shares of common stock september refinancing proceeds from the jw marriott  washington  dc mortgage loan september repayment of the jw marriott  washington  dc mortgage loan august retired a portion of series a senior notes due in august issuance of million shares of common stock april partial prepayment of the canadian mortgage loan march retired a portion of senior notes due in january repayment of the ritz carlton  naples and buckhead mortgage loan september retired senior notes due in financial condition debt and effect of financial covenants as of december   our debt totaled billion as described fully in note to our consolidated financial statements

additionally  approximately of debt had a fixed rate of interest 
as of december  and  the outstanding senior notes balance includes million and million  respectively  of fair value adjustments for interest rate swap agreements 
over time  we expect to decrease the proportion of fixed rate debt in our capital structure to to of our total debt  although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result on terms acceptable to us 
we may do this through the use of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps or through the periodic refinancings of fixed rate mortgage debt with floating rate debt 
in furtherance of this objective  in august we entered into two interest rate swap agreements maturing in october under the agreements  we receive fixed rate payments at and make floating rate payments based on six month libor plus basis points at december  on a combined notional amount of million 
these agreements have the effect of swapping our interest obligations on million in principal amount of series g senior notes to a floating rate of interest 
in addition  in september we refinanced the million mortgage debt secured by the jw marriott in washington  dc with an million floating rate mortgage loan with an interest rate of one month libor plus basis points at december  in connection with the refinancing  we also purchased an interest rate cap  which has the effect of limiting the interest rate on the new floating rate mortgage loan to not greater than for the first two years of the loan 
we may continue to enter into similar swaps or refinancings in the future 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of our sensitivity to interest rates 
credit facility and senior notes covenants 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture and the credit facility  our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions  including an ebitda to interest coverage ratio as defined in the senior notes indenture for host lp of at least to we do not currently meet this interest coverage ratio 
as a result  host marriott is limited in its ability to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock  except to the extent necessary to maintain host marriott s status as a reit 
in addition  we cannot incur indebtedness  except indebtedness specifically permitted under our senior notes indenture and the credit facility  which in both cases mainly consist of borrowings under the credit facility and borrowings in connection with a refinancing of existing debt 
for this reason  we generally cannot currently finance significant capital expenditures  acquisitions or other growth through the issuance of new debt other than borrowings under our credit facility 
accordingly  we would expect that until such time as our coverage ratio is greater than to our acquisitions or other growth will generally be funded with available cash  the proceeds of asset sales or the issuance of additional equity 
under our credit facility  we are required to use the proceeds of asset sales to reinvest in our assets  acquire new properties or to permanently reduce the revolving loan commitment in effect at the time 
in general  in the event that we consummate asset sales during any month period that generate net proceeds in excess of of our total assets calculated using undepreciated real estate assets  the revolving loan commitment will automatically be reduced by the amount of such proceeds to the extent that such proceeds are not reinvested or committed to be reinvested in our business within days following the date the threshold is exceeded 
the may amendment to the credit facility provided for certain exceptions to this general rule 
for instance  when the revolving loan commitment is million or less  further revolving loan commitment reductions occur with respect to asset sales proceeds that are not reinvested only to the extent that amounts are outstanding under the credit facility 
if no amounts are outstanding  a commitment reduction can be avoided if we achieve commensurate reductions in the amount of our secured indebtedness or indebtedness under our senior notes indenture 
our senior notes indenture has parallel requirements with respect to asset sales in excess of of our total assets during any month period 
under our senior notes indenture  amounts in excess of the threshold must be either reinvested in the business or used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility our availability under the credit facility would also be permanently reduced by the amount of the repayment 
if asset sale proceeds are not used for either of these purposes  then we are required to offer to repurchase our senior notes at par with the excess sale proceeds 
in november  we crossed the threshold 
as a result  the revolving loan commitment would automatically be reduced unless we reinvest or commit to reinvest the net sale proceeds from all such dispositions by november based on investments we have made in particular  the acquisition of the hyatt regency maui resort and spa on november  for million  as well as other planned capital expenditures  the dispositions to date will not result in a reduction of the credit facility availability 
we will  however  continue to be subject to these credit facility commitment reduction provisions and senior notes indenture requirements with respect to future dispositions  if any 
mortgage debt covenants 
substantially all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances of fraud  misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions 
as of february   we have assets that are secured by mortgage debt 
eleven of these assets are secured by mortgage debt that have restrictive covenants which require the mortgage servicer or lender to retain and hold in escrow the cash flow after debt service when it declines below specified operating levels 
the effect of these covenants is discussed below eight of our hotel properties secure a million mortgage loan that is the sole asset of a trust that issued commercial mortgage pass through certificates  which we refer to as the cmbs loan 
the hotels  which comprise what we refer to as the cmbs portfolio  are listed in the notes to our financial statements 
the cmbs loan contains a provision that requires the mortgage servicer to retain certain excess cash flow from the cmbs portfolio after payment of debt service approximately million if net cash flow after payment of taxes  insurance  ground rent and reserves for furniture  fixtures and equipment for the trailing twelve months declines below million 
annual debt service is million 
as a result of the effect of the weak economy on our operations  this provision was triggered beginning in the third quarter of and will remain in effect until the cmbs portfolio generates the necessary minimum cash flow for two consecutive quarters  at which point  the cash that has been escrowed will be returned to us 
as of december   approximately million of cash has been escrowed 
we anticipated that additional cash of approximately million will be required to be escrowed in we do not expect cash flows from the cmbs portfolio to be at the level required to trigger the release of the escrow until we have a significant improvement in operations 
as such  additional amounts will be escrowed  and these amounts may be significant 
we currently have a million loan secured by three of our canadian properties that matures in this loan was originally entered into during august for million and was secured by all four of our canadian properties 
as a result of a decline in operations at these properties in late and  we were required under the loan agreement to escrow operating cash from the hotels after the payment of debt service 
in april  approximately million of the cash escrowed in accordance with the loan was applied to the outstanding balance of the indebtedness and approximately million was released to us 
because operating results at our three properties located in toronto had not yet fully recovered from the impact which sars had on travel to this city  we entered into an agreement with our lenders in july to modify certain covenants so that we would not be required to make additional prepayments at that time 
the terms of the modification required us to provide additional collateral of million in cash and pay an additional basis points of interest on the loan 
as this loan is denominated in united states dollars and the functional currency of the properties is canadian dollars  we entered into currency forward contracts to buy us dollars at a fixed price at the time we entered into the loan 
these forward contracts hedge the currency exposure of converting canadian dollars into us dollars on a monthly basis to cover debt service payments  including the original final balloon payment of approximately million 
these contracts had been designated as cash flow hedges of the debt service and balloon payment and were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with offsetting changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in december  we made a partial repayment of approximately million of the canadian mortgage loan in addition to the april repayment mentioned above 
we also terminated foreign currency forward contracts in an amount equal to the aggregate repayment 
as a result of these prepayments  the forward currency exchange contracts were deemed ineffective hedges for accounting purposes and we recorded a loss on the contracts of approximately million in we will record the change in the fair value of the outstanding forward currency contracts in operations each period 
in conjunction with the december prepayment  one of the hotels and the million deposit was released from the collateral 
the current loan is still subject to the escrow provisions and we anticipate that additional cash of approximately million will be required to be escrowed in credit ratings currently  we have billion of senior notes outstanding that are rated by moody s investors service and standard poor s 
as a result of our significantly reduced operating levels over the past few years  the ratings on our senior notes have been downgraded or placed on negative credit watch 
on february   standard and poor s downgraded its rating on our senior debt from bb to b 
at the same time standard poor s also downgraded its rating on host marriott s preferred stock from b to ccc 
on august   moody s announced that it had placed its ba rating of our senior unsecured debt and its b rating of host marriott s preferred stock under review for possible downgrade 
on december   moody s concluded its review and changed its ratings outlook on our senior notes and host marriott s preferred stock to stable 
while we have no senior note maturities until  if our operations were to decline further  or if our credit ratios do not otherwise improve  the ratings on our senior notes could be further reduced 
if we were unable to subsequently improve our credit ratings  our cost to issue additional senior notes  either in connection with a refinancing or otherwise  or to issue additional preferred stock would likely increase 
dividend policy host marriott is required to distribute to its stockholders at least of its taxable income in order to qualify as a reit  including taxable income we recognize for tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive corresponding cash 
funds used by host marriott to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock are provided through distributions from host lp 
for every share of common and preferred stock of host marriott  host lp has issued to host marriott a corresponding common op unit and preferred op unit 
as of february   host marriott is the owner of substantially all of the preferred op units and approximately of the common op units 
the remaining of the common op units are held by various third party limited partners 
as a result of the minority position in host lp common op units  these holders share  on a pro rata basis  in amounts being distributed by host lp 
as a general rule  when host marriott pays a common or preferred dividend  host lp pays an equivalent per unit distribution on all common or corresponding preferred op units 
for example  if host marriott paid a five cent per share dividend on its common stock  it would be based on payment of a five cent per common op unit distribution by host lp to host marriott and all other common op unit holders 
our failure to meet the ebitda to interest coverage ratio in our senior notes indenture and credit facility  as previously discussed  restricts our ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred equity  except to the extent necessary to maintain host marriott s status as a reit 
required income distributions for were satisfied in part by the payment of dividends on the preferred stock in and in the first three quarters of taxable income generated by the insurance recovery on the world trade center and financial center hotels was sufficient to allow host marriott to pay the preferred stock dividend for the fourth quarter of we expect that the taxable income generated by the insurance recovery will also be sufficient to allow host marriott to pay up to the first three quarters of preferred stock dividends in preferred dividend payments beyond those supported by the taxable income generated by this settlement will depend on  among other factors  taxable income or loss from operations in or our ability to meet a minimum ebitda to interest coverage ratio both as required by the senior notes indenture 
host marriott did not pay a dividend on its common stock and  correspondingly  host lp did not make a distribution on its common op units in and host marriott does not currently expect to pay a meaningful common dividend for other than to satisfy any remaining income distribution requirements 
the decision to reinstate the common dividend including the amount of any such dividend will be made by the board of directors and will depend on several factors  including those described above for distributions on the preferred stock  as well as our liquidity and any accrued unpaid dividends on the preferred stock 
investments in affiliates we have made investments in certain ventures which we do not consolidate and  accordingly  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in accordance with our accounting policies as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
over the past several years we have actively marketed and sold our interests in various partnerships which are no longer consistent with our core portfolio 
as a result  except for the partnerships described below any remaining interests are insignificant and or the partnerships have no recourse to the company 
we have included the table below and the following discussion to provide investors with additional information on these investments 
investments in affiliates consist of the following at december  ownership interests investment debt assets in millions cbm joint venture llc courtyard hotels tiburon golf ventures  lp hole golf club total we and marriott international each own a interest in cbm joint venture  which owns  through two limited partnerships  courtyard by marriott properties totaling  rooms 
the joint venture  cbm joint venture llc  has approximately million of debt 
this debt consists of first mortgage loans secured by the properties owned by each of the two partnerships  senior notes secured by the ownership interest in one partnership and mezzanine debt 
the mezzanine debt is an obligation of a subsidiary of the joint venture and the lender is an affiliate of marriott international 
none of the debt is recourse to  or guaranteed by  us or any of our subsidiaries 
revpar at the courtyard hotels declined for when compared to the same period in based on our current forecasts for the full year  the hotels in one of these two partnerships are not expected to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund the partnership s debt service obligations 
to the extent that there is insufficient cash flow to fund its debt service obligations  the partnership will continue to make use of i available unrestricted cash balances  ii a senior note debt service reserve  iii certain rights to require repayment to the partnership of a portion of ground rent and certain management fees it has previously paid to marriott international  and iv subordination provisions for current payments in its ground leases and management agreements to cover any shortfall 
as of december   the joint venture has deferred a total of million in ground rent and base management fees 
interest does not accrue on such deferred amounts  but these amounts must be repaid prior to distributions to equity holders 
in addition  we anticipate that the joint venture will continue to defer interest payments on the mezzanine debt for at least the first half of as of december   the joint venture has deferred million of interest payments on the mezzanine debt 
deferral of these interest payments is not a default under the mezzanine debt agreements 
to the extent deferred  unpaid mezzanine debt interest amounts have been added to principal and earn interest at 
as of december   the partnerships and the joint venture maintained aggregate unrestricted cash balances of approximately million 
we did not receive any cash distributions from this investment during or we currently have a limited partner interest in tiburon golf ventures  lp  which owns the greg norman designed golf club surrounding the ritz carlton  naples golf resort 
cash distributions from this investment were million in both and off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we are party to various transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities which we refer to as off balance sheet arrangements under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees 
as of december   we are party to the following material off balance sheet arrangements tax sharing arrangements 
under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies such as marriott international  host marriott services corporation and barcel crestline corporation formerly crestline capital corporation  we are obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us 
for example  a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us 
this adjustment could produce a material tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement 
in addition  under the partnership agreement between host marriott and host lp  host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties incurred by host marriott  as well as any liabilities the irs successfully may assert against host marriott 
we do not expect any amounts paid under the tax sharing arrangement to be material 
tax indemnification agreements 
for reasons relating to tax considerations of the former and current owners of nine hotels  we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels  or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel 
these agreements require that we indemnify the owners for their tax consequences resulting from our selling the hotel or refinancing the mortgage debt during the period under the agreement 
we have also agreed not to sell more than of the original allocated value attributable to the former owners of a portfolio of additional hotels  or to take other actions that would result in the recognition and allocation of gain to the former owners of such hotels for income tax purposes 
because the timing of these potential transactions is within our control  we believe that the likelihood of any material indemnification to be remote and therefore not material to our financial statements 
guarantees 
we have certain guarantees  which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt  that are not on our books due to various dispositions  spin offs and contractual arrangements  but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party 
we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote 
the largest guarantees by dollar amount are listed below we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non lodging properties 
these primarily represent divested restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of rental payments 
the aggregate amount of these guaranteed payments is approximately million as of december  in  we owned leisure park venture limited partnership  which owns and operates a senior living facility 
we spun off the partnership as part of crestline in the reit conversion  but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in however  to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee  we have been indemnified by crestline  who  in turn  is indemnified by the current owner of the facility 
information on other guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our obligations for principal payments on our debt  future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases and projected capital expenditures  each as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total the amounts shown include amortization of principal and debt maturities on our debt as well as discounts of million on our senior notes 
future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants of million  payable to us under non cancelable subleases 
the lease payments also include interest payable of million 
future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants and the hpt subleases of million and million  respectively  payable to us under non cancelable subleases 
our purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels 
under our contracts  we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years and some of the current year amount reflects prior year contracts that were deferred or not completed 
see capital expenditures 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of host marriott and all consolidated subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates impairment testing 
we are required by gaap to record an impairment charge when we believe that one or more of our hotels has been impaired  whereby  future undiscounted cash flows for the hotel would be less than the net book value of the hotel 
for impaired assets  we record an impairment charge when a property s fair value less selling costs is less than its net book value 
we test for impairment in several situations in accordance with sfas  including when current or projected cash flows are less than historical cash flows  when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life  as well as whenever an asset is classified as held for sale or events or changes in circumstances indicate that a hotel s net book value may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the impairment of our hotels  we make many assumptions and estimates  including projected cash flows  holding period  expected useful life future capital expenditures fair values  including consideration of capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices changes in these estimates  assumptions  future changes in economic conditions or property level results could require us to record additional impairment charges  which would be reflected in operations in the future 
classification of assets as held for sale 
we classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met our board of directors has approved the sale to the extent the dollar magnitude of the sale requires board approval  a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed  the buyer has committed a significant amount of non refundable cash  and no significant financing contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner 
to the extent a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property  we will record an impairment loss 
see the discussion above concerning the use of estimates and judgments in determining fair values for impairment tests 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we have approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of million  in consolidated deferred tax assets as of december  sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes  the objectives of which are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company s financial statements or tax returns 
we have considered various factors  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the million in deferred tax assets in the future 
when a determination is made that all  or a portion  of the deferred tax assets may not be realized  an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period 
valuation of foreign currency and derivative contracts 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
we have three interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december  our interest rate swap agreements with a fair market value of million as of december  have been designated as fair value hedges  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if a particular interest rate swap does not qualify as highly effective  any change in the fair value of the derivative used as a hedge would be reflected in current earnings 
should any change in management strategy  or any other circumstance  cause an existing highly effective hedge to become ineffective  the accumulated loss or gain in the value of the derivative instrument since its inception may be reclassified from the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet to current net income 
we also have two interest rate cap agreements that are fair valued each quarter and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income 
we also have several foreign currency forward exchange contracts that we previously used to hedge the mortgage loan on our canadian properties 
the hedge has been deemed ineffective for accounting purposes 
see the discussion in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we estimate the fair value of all of these instruments through the use of third party valuations  which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments 
the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves 
the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations 
the fair value of our existing foreign currency and derivatives is likely to fluctuate materially from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity 
consolidation policies 
judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in the evaluation of control  including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights  as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities in currently  we have investments in entities that in the aggregate own hotel properties and other investments which we record using the equity method of accounting 
these entities are considered to be voting interest entities 
the debt on these investments is non recourse to the company and the effect of their operations on our results of operations is not material 
while we do not believe we are required to consolidate any of our current partnerships or joint ventures  if we were required to do so  then all of the results of operations and the assets and liabilities would be included in our financial statements 
for further detail on our unconsolidated entities see note to our consolidated financial statements 
lodging statistics reporting periods for hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results the results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers 
our hotel managers use different reporting periods 
marriott international  inc  the manager of the majority of our properties  uses a year ending on the friday closest to december and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its marriott managed hotels 
in contrast  other managers of our hotels  such as hyatt  report results on a monthly basis 
host marriott  as a reit  is required by tax laws to report results on a calendar year 
as a result  we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by marriott international modified so that our fiscal year always ends on december to comply with reit rules 
our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as marriott international but our fourth quarter ends on december two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are quarterly start dates will usually differ between years  except for the first quarter which always commences on january  and our first and fourth quarters of operations and year to date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years 
for example  the third quarter of ended on september and the third quarter of ended on september  though both quarters reflect twelve weeks of operations 
in contrast  fourth quarter results for reflected days of operations  while our fourth quarter results for reflected days of operations 
in contrast to the reporting periods for our statement of operations  our hotel operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy are always reported based on the reporting cycle used by marriott international for our marriott managed hotels 
this facilitates year to year comparisons  as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year except in the case of fourth quarters comprised of seventeen weeks  such as fiscal year  versus sixteen weeks 
this means  however  that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics may differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year 
for the hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein hotel results for fiscal year reflect weeks of operations for the period from january  to january  for our marriott managed properties and results from january  to december  for operations of all other hotels which report results on a monthly basis 
hotel results for fiscal year reflect weeks of operations for the period from december  to january  for our marriott managed hotels and results from january  to december  for operations of all other hotels which report results on a monthly basis 
hotel results for the fourth quarter of reflect weeks of operations for the period from september  to january  for our marriott managed hotels and results from september  to december  for operations of all other hotels which report results on a monthly basis 
hotel results for the fourth quarter of reflect weeks of operations for the period from september  to january  for our marriott managed hotels and results from september  to december  for operations of all other hotels which report results on a monthly basis 
comparable hotel operating statistics we present certain operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues  expenses and adjusted operating profit for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis 
we define our comparable hotels as full service properties i that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results  whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations  for the entirety of the operating periods being compared  and ii that have not sustained substantial property damage or undergone large scale capital projects during the reporting periods being compared 
for and  we consider of our portfolio of full service hotels owned on december  to be comparable hotels 
the operating results of the following hotels that we owned as of december  are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods the new york marriott financial center substantially damaged in the september  terrorist attacks and re opened in january  the ritz carlton  naples golf resort opened in january  the boston marriott copley place acquired in june  the jw marriott  washington  dc consolidated in our financial statements beginning in the second quarter of  and the hyatt regency maui resort and spa acquired in november 
in addition  the operating results of the eight hotels we disposed of in and the one hotel we disposed of in are also not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein 
moreover  because these statistics and operating results are for our full service hotel properties  they exclude results for our non hotel properties and leased limited service hotels 
hotel operating statistics the following tables set forth performance information for our full service hotels by geographic region for and for our comparable hotels  as well as all full service hotels

non gaap financial measures we use certain non gaap financial measures  which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  within the meaning of applicable sec rules 
they are as follows i funds from operations ffo per diluted share  and ii comparable hotel operating results 
the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance 
ffo per diluted share we present ffo per diluted share as a non gaap measure of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap 
we calculate ffo per diluted share for a given operating period as our ffo defined as set forth below for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities  including the payment of preferred stock dividends  in accordance with nareit guidelines 
we believe that ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that presentation of ffo per diluted share  when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share  provides beneficial information to investors 
by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation  amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  we believe that such measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits  even though ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted by nareit in its april white paper on funds from operations  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
for these reasons  nareit adopted the definition of ffo in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance 
we calculate ffo per diluted share  in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the nareit definition of ffo or calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance 
in addition  although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits  it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non reits 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
cash expenditures for various long term assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the ffo per diluted share presentations 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense  capital expenditures  and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
additionally  ffo per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
in addition  ffo per diluted share does not measure  and should not be used as a measure of  amounts that accrue directly to shareholders benefit 
comparable hotel operating results we present certain operating results for our full service hotels  such as hotel revenues  expenses and adjusted operating profit  on a comparable hotel  or same store basis as supplemental information for investors 
our comparable hotel operating results present operating results for full service hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions  significant property damage or large scale capital improvements incurred during these periods 
we present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate level costs and expenses related to our capital structure  as well as depreciation and amortization 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses to arrive at property level results because we believe property level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of management in running our business on a property level basis 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization  because even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted earlier  because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization  the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues  expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts  all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance 
we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
in particular  these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors  such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions 
while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance  this measure is not used to allocate resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels  as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results 
for these reasons  we believe that comparable hotel operating results  when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit  revenues and expenses  provide useful information to investors and management

new accounting pronouncements the fasb recently issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  or sfas this statement requires issuers to classify as liabilities or assets in some circumstances three classes of freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer 
previously  many such instruments had been classified as equity 
a freestanding financial instrument is an instrument that is entered into separately and apart from any of the entity s other financial instruments or equity transactions  or that is entered into in conjunction with some other transaction and is legally detachable and separately exercisable  such as certain put and call options 
these provisions are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise are effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  on october   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance with respect to sfas that issuers whose financial statements include consolidated ventures with finite lives should reflect any minority interests in such consolidated ventures as a liability on the issuer s financial statements presented at its fair value as of the applicable balance sheet date 
under sfas  any fluctuation in the fair value of the minority interest from period to period would be recorded on the issuers financial statements as interest expense for the change in the fair value of the liability 
as a result of applying sfas in accordance with this guidance from the fasb  in our third quarter form q we recorded a loss from a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million 
additionally  we included in our liabilities as of september   minority interests with a fair value of million 
on november   the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp indefinitely deferring the application of a portion of sfas with respect to minority interests in consolidated ventures entered into prior to november   effectively reversing its guidance of october  in accordance with the fsp  in the fourth quarter of we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle reversing the impact of our adoption of sfas with respect to consolidated ventures with finite lives 
we adopted financial interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin in in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin  which we refer to as fin r 
under this guidance  our limited purpose trust subsidiary that was formed to issue trust preferred securities the convertible preferred securities trust is considered to be a special purpose entity because its activities are so restricted that host marriott  the sole equity holder  lacks the ability to make decisions about the convertible preferred securities trust s activities through voting or similar rights 
the transition guidance set forth in fin r allows us to apply the provisions of either fin or fin r to special purpose entities in which we have a variable interest at december  we account for our convertible preferred securities trust on a consolidated basis as of december  since we are the primary beneficiary under fin based on our fixed price call option and the holders of the convertible preferred securities are widely dispersed and unrelated 
we are required to apply the provisions of fin r to the convertible preferred securities trust in the first quarter of under fin r we will not be the primary beneficiary and accordingly  we are required to deconsolidate the accounts of the convertible preferred securities trust 
this will result in our recognizing the million in debentures issued by convertible preferred securities trust as debt  eliminating the million of convertible preferred securities currently classified in the mezzanine section of our balance sheet and recognizing  as an equity investment  the million invested in the convertible preferred securities trust 
additionally  we would classify the related dividend payments as interest expense 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december  notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are presented in us dollar equivalents  which is our reporting currency 
the interest rate swaps and caps that we have entered into are strictly to hedge interest rate risk and not for trading purposes 
expected maturity date thereafter total fair value in millions liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate variable rate mortgages average interest rate total debt interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate excludes the fair market value of the swaps which were million as of december  as of december   approximately of our debt bears interest at fixed rates 
this debt structure largely mitigates the impact of changes in interest rates 
we have some financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including our credit facility 
the interest rate on our credit facility is based on a spread over libor  ranging from to 
there were no amounts outstanding on our credit facility at december over time  we expect to decrease the proportion of fixed rate debt on our capital structure to to of our total debt  although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result on terms acceptable to us 
in furtherance of this objective  we have entered into three interest rate swaps effectively converting million of fixed rate payments to floating rate payments based on a spread to libor 
on december   we entered into a year interest rate swap agreement  which was effective on january  and matures in january  effectively converting our series i senior notes to floating rate debt 
under the swap  we receive fixed rate payments of and pay floating rate payments based on one month libor plus basis points on a million notional amount 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge for both financial reporting and tax purposes and the amounts paid or received under the swap agreement will be recognized over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense 
changes in the fair value of the swap and the series i notes are reflected in the balance sheet as offsetting changes and have no income statement effect 
the fair value of the interest rate swap at december  and december  was million and million  respectively  which is included in the senior notes line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
on august   we entered into two four year interest rate swap agreements  which mature october  effectively converting our series g senior notes to floating rate debt 
under the swaps  we receive fixed rate payments of and we make floating rate payments based on six month libor plus basis points on a million notional amount  which is equal to the current amount of outstanding series g senior notes 
we have designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for both financial reporting and tax purposes and the amounts paid or received under the swap agreements will be recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense 
changes in the fair value of the swaps and our series g senior notes are reflected in the balance sheet as offsetting changes and have no income statement effect 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps at december  was million  which is included in the senior notes line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
a change in libor of basis points will result in a million increase or decrease in our annual interest expense as a result of the combined million in swap agreements 
in addition  on september   we refinanced the million fixed rate mortgage debt secured by the jw marriott in washington  dc with an million floating rate mortgage loan with an interest rate of one month libor plus basis points 
the loan matures september  but can be extended for up to three additional years subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
we also have approximately million of floating rate mortgage debt associated with three of our canadian properties 
see below for further information 
exchange rate sensitivity foreign currency forward exchange agreements the table below summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including foreign currency forward exchange agreements as of december  the foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into are strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes 
for foreign currency forward exchange agreements  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
these notional amounts generally are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
expected maturity date thereafter total fair value in millions anticipated transactions and related derivatives foreign currency forward exchange agreements contract amount average contractual exchange rate on august   our canadian subsidiaries entered into a mortgage loan pursuant to which they borrowed million denominated in us dollars at a variable rate of libor plus 
the weighted average interest rate for this mortgage loan was and  respectively  for the years ended december  and in addition  since the mortgage loan on these canadian properties is denominated in us dollars and the functional currency of the canadian subsidiaries is the canadian dollar  the subsidiaries entered into currency forward contracts to hedge the currency exposure of converting canadian dollars to us dollars on a monthly basis to cover debt service payments 
up until april as discussed in debt  these forward exchange contracts had been designated as a cash flow hedges of the debt service payments  and the forward contracts were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with offsetting changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of december   substantially all of the remaining forward contracts are not designated as a hedge and accordingly the change in fair value is recorded in operations each period 
the fair value of the forward contracts was million and million  respectively  at december  and december  forward looking statements in this report on form k and the information incorporated by reference herein we make some forward looking statements

risk factors prospective investors should carefully consider  among other factors  the material risks described below 
financial risks and risks of operation we depend on external sources of capital for future growth and we may be unable to access capital when necessary 
unlike corporations  our ability to reduce our debt and finance our growth largely must be funded by external sources of capital because we are generally required to distribute to our stockholders at least of our taxable income in order to qualify as a reit  including taxable income we recognize for tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive corresponding cash 
our ability to access the external capital we require could be hampered by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control  including  without limitation  declining general market conditions  unfavorable market perception of our growth potential  decreases in our current and estimated future earnings  excessive cash distributions or decreases in the market price of our common stock 
in addition  our ability to access additional capital may also be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness  which  among other things  restricts our incurrence of debt and the payment of distributions 
the occurrence of any of these above mentioned factors  individually or in combination  could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us or at all and the failure to obtain necessary external capital could have a material adverse affect our ability to finance our future growth 
we have substantial leverage 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness and that could have important consequences 
it currently requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  expansion efforts  distributions to our stockholders and other general purposes 
additionally  our high level of indebtedness could limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our indebtedness or obtain financing for expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate or business purposes  or affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions 
if our cash flow and working capital were not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness  we would have to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity  the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by the operating partnership  or the sale of our assets 
we cannot assure you that any of these sources of funds would be available to us or  if available  would be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient for us to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan 
our revenues and the value of our properties are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry 
the lodging industry has experienced a difficult period  and operations have generally been declining for the past several years  which has caused declines in our revenue per available room  or revpar  and profit margins 
the decline in the lodging industry has been attributed to a number of factors including a weak economy  the effect of terror alerts and potential terrorist activity in the united states and the war in iraq  all of which have changed the travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers 
it is not clear whether these changes are permanent or whether they will continue to evolve creating new opportunities or difficulties for the industry 
any forecast we make regarding our results of operations may be affected and can change based on the following risks changes in the national  regional and local economic climate  reduced demand and increased operating costs and other conditions resulting from terrorist threats  changes in business and leisure travel patterns  local market conditions such as an oversupply of hotel rooms or a reduction in lodging demand  the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to our competition  the performance of the managers of our hotels  changes in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors  and unionization of the labor force at our hotels 
our expenses may not decrease if our revenue drops 
many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels  such as debt payments  property taxes  insurance  utilities  and employee wages and benefits  are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in revenue at the property 
because of weak economic conditions over the last several years  particularly in the lodging industry  we have been working with our managers to reduce the operating costs of our hotels 
while we have achieved reductions in operating costs as a result of these efforts  further cost reductions could be difficult to achieve if operating levels continue to decline 
some of the cost reduction efforts undertaken may eventually need to be reversed even if operations remain at reduced levels 
regardless of these efforts to reduce costs  our expenses will be affected by inflationary increases  and in the case of certain costs  such as wages  benefits and insurance  may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period 
our managers may be unable to offset any such increased expenses with higher room rates 
any of our efforts to reduce operating costs or failure to make scheduled capital expenditures could adversely affect the growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties 
our revenues may be affected by increased use of reservation systems based on the internet 
although a majority of the rooms sold on the internet are sold through websites maintained by our managers  a growing number of rooms are also sold through independent internet sites 
these independent internet sites often purchase rooms at a negotiated discount from participating properties  which could result in lower average room rates compared to the room rates offered by the manager on its website 
while we do not believe that price is the only factor considered when choosing our properties  if the room rate available to consumers using the independent internet sites were to be significantly lower than those offered by our managers on their websites our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our ground lease payments may increase faster than the revenues we receive on the hotels situated on the leased properties 
as of february   forty of our hotels are subject to ground leases 
these ground leases generally require increases in ground rent payments every five years 
our ability to service our debt could be adversely affected to the extent that our revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases 
in addition  if we were to sell a hotel encumbered by a ground lease  the buyer would have to assume the ground lease  which may result in a lower sales price 
we do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels 
because federal income tax laws restrict reits and their subsidiaries from operating a hotel  we do not manage our hotels 
instead  we lease substantially all of our full service properties to subsidiaries that qualify as a taxable reit subsidiaries under applicable reit laws  and our taxable reit subsidiaries retain third party managers to manage our hotels pursuant to management agreements 
our income from the hotels may be adversely affected if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they fail to maintain a quality brand name 
while our taxable reit subsidiaries monitor the hotel managers performance  we have limited specific recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately 
in addition  from time to time  we have had  and continue to have  differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements 
we generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations 
however  if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations  we may choose to litigate such a dispute 
failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  our hotel managers manage  and in some cases own or have invested in  hotels that compete with our hotels  which may result in conflicts of interest 
as a result  our managers have in the past made and may in the future make decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interests 
the terms of our debt place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries  reducing operational flexibility and creating default risks 
the documents governing the terms of the senior notes and credit facility of the operating partnership contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries 
the activities upon which such restrictions exist include  but are not limited to acquisitions  mergers and consolidations  the incurrence of additional debt  the creation of liens  the sale of assets  capital expenditures  raising capital from the issuance of certain types of mandatorily redeemable capital stock  the payment of dividends  and transactions with affiliates 
in addition  certain covenants in the credit facility of the operating partnership require it and our other subsidiaries to meet financial performance tests 
the restrictive covenants in the indenture  the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt including our mortgage debt will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest 
the operating partnership s failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt 
our mortgage debt contains provisions that may reduce our liquidity 
certain of our mortgage debt requires that  to the extent cash flow from the hotels which secure such debt drops below stated levels  we escrow cash flow after the payment of debt service until operations improve above the stated levels 
in some cases  the escrowed amount may be applied to the outstanding balance of the mortgage debt 
when such provisions are triggered  there can be no assurance that the affected properties will achieve the minimum cash flow levels required to trigger a release of any escrowed funds 
the amounts required to be escrowed may be material and may negatively affect our liquidity by limiting our access to cash flow after debt service from these mortgaged properties 
our future cash distributions on preferred and common stock may be limited by the terms of our indebtedness and in addition  our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be further limited by the terms of our preferred stock 
under the terms of our credit facility and our senior notes indenture  distributions to us by the operating partnership  which we depend upon in order to obtain the cash necessary to pay dividends  are permitted only to the extent that  at the time of the distributions  the operating partnership can satisfy certain financial covenant tests and meet other requirements 
for example  to make distributions to us  the operating partnership must in general have a consolidated coverage ratio measuring the pro forma ratio of its consolidated ebitda to its consolidated interest expense of to or greater 
in addition  the aggregate amount of all of our debt  not including our convertible preferred securities  must be less than or equal to of our total assets plus accumulated depreciation 
if it fails to meet these requirements  the operating partnership will only be able to make cash distributions to us  subject to compliance with certain other requirements  in the amounts required to maintain our qualification as a reit 
we are currently required to distribute to our stockholders at least of our taxable income to maintain our status as a reit 
as of december   we remained under the to ebitda to interest coverage ratio 
accordingly  we will be able to pay dividends only to the extent that we have taxable income and are required to make distributions to maintain our status as a reit 
under the terms of each of our class a  class b and class c cumulative redeemable preferred stock  we are not permitted to pay dividends on our common stock unless cumulative dividends have been paid or funds for payment have been set aside for payment on each such class of preferred stock 
therefore  our ability to pay a dividend on our common stock is subject to our having previously paid all cumulative dividends accrued on our outstanding classes of preferred stock 
our ability to pay dividends on our preferred and common stock is also limited by the terms of our convertible preferred securities 
the payment of any dividends on either common or preferred shares depends on operating performance and its impact on current and prior year taxable income and whether our ebitda to interest ratio is below to coverage for the fiscal year 
we cannot provide assurance that our operations will be sufficient to permit us to pay a dividend on our common stock or preferred stock 
rating agency downgrades may increase our cost of capital 
both our senior notes and our preferred stock are rated by independent rating agencies  such as moody s and standard poor s 
these rating agencies may elect to downgrade their ratings on our corporate debt and our preferred stock at any time 
these downgrades negatively affect our access to the capital markets and increase our cost of capital 
our management agreements could impair the sale or financing of our hotels 
under the terms of our management agreements  we generally may not sell  lease or otherwise transfer the hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions 
our ability to finance or sell any of the properties  depending upon the structure of such transactions  may require the manager s consent 
if  in these circumstances  the manager does not consent  we would be prohibited from taking actions in our best interest without breaching the management agreement 
the acquisition contracts relating to some hotels limit our ability to sell or refinance those hotels 
for reasons relating to tax considerations of the former and current owners of nine hotels  we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels  or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel 
we have also agreed not to sell more than of the original allocated value attributable to the former owners of a portfolio of additional hotels  or to take other actions that would result in the recognition and allocation of gain to the former owners of such hotels for income tax purposes 
we anticipate that  in specified circumstances  we may agree to similar restrictions in connection with future hotel acquisitions 
as a result  even if it were in our best interests to sell these hotels or repay or otherwise reduce the level of the mortgage debt on such hotels  it may be difficult or costly to do so during their respective lock out periods 
we may be unable to sell properties because real estate investments are illiquid 
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions 
the inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to service our debt 
in addition  there are limitations under the federal tax laws applicable to reits that may limit our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets 
we depend on our key personnel 
our success depends on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel 
none of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers 
we cannot assure you that these key personnel will remain employed by us 
while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our financial performance 
litigation judgments or settlements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we are a party to various lawsuits  including lawsuits relating to our conversion into a reit 
while we and the other defendants to such lawsuits believe all of the lawsuits in which we are a defendant are without merit and we are vigorously defending against such claims  we can give no assurance as to the outcome of any of the lawsuits 
if any of the lawsuits were to be determined adversely to us or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money were to occur  there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts 
instead of purchasing hotel properties directly  we may invest as a co venturer 
joint venturers often share control over the operation of the joint venture assets 
for example  we entered into a joint venture with marriott international that owns two limited partnerships holding  in the aggregate  courtyard by marriott hotels 
subsidiaries of marriott international manage these courtyard by marriott hotels and other subsidiaries of marriott international serve as ground lessors and mezzanine lender to the partnerships 
actions by a co venturer could subject the assets to additional risk  including our co venturer in an investment might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our  or the joint venture s  interests or goals  our co venturer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives  or our co venturer could go bankrupt  leaving us liable for its share of joint venture liabilities 
although we generally will seek to maintain sufficient control of any joint venture to permit our objectives to be achieved  we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners 
also  our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent 
environmental problems are possible and can be costly 
we believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws 
unidentified environmental liabilities could arise  however  and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance 
federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property 
the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination 
these laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants 
even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination  each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred 
in addition  third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 
environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of asbestos 
these laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos  that they notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions  including removal or other abatement  if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
compliance with other government regulations can be costly 
our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation  including title iii of the americans with disabilities act  building codes and regulations pertaining to fire safety 
compliance with those laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures 
these regulations may be changed from time to time  or new regulations adopted  resulting in additional costs of compliance  including potential litigation 
any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
future terrorist attacks or changes in terror alert levels could adversely affect us 
previous terrorist attacks in the united states have adversely affected the travel and hospitality industries  including the full service portion of the hotel industry 
the impact which terrorist attacks in the united states or elsewhere could have on our business in particular and the us economy  the global economy and global financial markets in general is indeterminable 
it is possible that such attacks or the threat of such attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business  our ability to finance our business  our ability to insure our properties and on our results of operations and financial condition as a whole 
some potential losses are not covered by insurance 
we carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability  property  business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties 
these policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar type properties 
generally  our all risk property policies provide that coverage is available on a per occurrence basis and that  for each occurrence  there is an overall limit as well as various sub limits on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive 
sub limits exist for certain types of claims such as service interruption  abatement  earthquakes  expediting costs or landscaping replacement  and the dollar amounts of these sub limits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit 
our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sub limits contained in our policies have been exceeded and  in the case of our hotels where the manager provides this coverage  any such claims will also be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the managers program for the same purpose 
that means that  if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels  or  in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the management company  affects hotels owned by others  the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sub limits  depending on the type of claim  have been reached and each affected hotel will only receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy 
we may incur losses in excess of insured limits and  as a result  we may be even less likely to receive sufficient coverage for risks that affect multiple properties such as earthquakes or certain types of terrorism 
in addition  there are other risks such as war  certain forms of terrorism such as nuclear  biological or chemical terrorism and some environmental hazards that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or may be too expensive to justify insuring against 
if any such risk were to materialize and materially adversely affect one or more of our properties  we would likely not be able to recover our losses 
we may also encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy 
should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier  we could lose all  or a portion of  the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel 
in that event  we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
we may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts  and federal terrorism legislation does not ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future 
as a result of the september  terrorist attacks  most insurers ceased to offer terrorism coverage in conjunction with all risk property policies described below  and the main source of property terrorism coverage became separate standalone terrorism insurance policies offering limited coverage amounts with high premium levels 
we have procured such standalone terrorism coverage  which is subject to annual aggregate limits which fall below the full replacement cost of certain high value properties  and with more limited coverage than the all risk program shared among various hotels 
on november   the federal terrorism risk insurance act of tria required all risk and liability insurers who had excluded or limited terrorism coverage to remove the exclusion in exchange for requiring insureds to pay an additional premium for the coverage within a specified time period 
because our liability policies generally offered terrorism coverage  tria mainly impacts our all risk insurance 
we  through marriott international and our broker for certain of our non marriott international properties  purchased the additional tria terrorism coverage 
the original standalone policies were allowed to expire 
this terrorism coverage  compared to standalone coverage  offers the higher limits and more comprehensive coverage associated with our all risk programs 
however  as noted above  the all risk program also has limitations such as per occurrence limits and sublimits which might have to be shared proportionally across participating hotels under certain loss scenarios 
all risk insurers also only have to provide tria related coverage for certified acts of terrorism namely those which are committed on behalf of non united states persons or interests 
further  we do not have full replacement coverage at all of our properties for acts of terrorism committed on behalf of united states persons or interests  as our coverage for such incidents is limited to that provided by a new standalone program  or an endorsement to the policy covering our non marriott properties  and their aggregate limits 
in addition  property damage related to war and to nuclear incidents is excluded under our standalone terrorism policy 
the all risk policy also excludes coverage for chemical and biological incidents  and it is unclear whether these incidents would be covered under our other standalone policy 
while tria will reimburse insurers for losses resulting from nuclear  biological and chemical perils  tria does not require insurers to offer coverage for these perils and  to date  insurers are not willing to provide this coverage  even with government reinsurance 
in addition  tria terminates on december   and there is no guarantee that the terrorism coverage that it mandates will be readily available or affordable thereafter 
as a result of the above  there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the extent and adequacy of terrorism coverage that will be available to protect our interests in the event of future terrorist attacks that impact our properties 
risks of ownership of our common stock there are limitations on the acquisition of our common stock and changes in control 
our charter and bylaws  the partnership agreement of the operating partnership  our stockholder rights plan and the maryland general corporation law contain a number of provisions  the exercise of which could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of us that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or otherwise be in their best interests  including the following ownership limit 
the ownership limit described under risk factors risks of ownership of our common stock there are possible adverse consequences of limits on ownership of our common stock may have the effect of precluding a change in control of us by a third party without the consent of our board of directors  even if the change in control would be in the interest of our stockholders  and even if the change in control would not reasonably jeopardize our real estate investment trust  or reit  status 
staggered board 
our charter provides that our number of directors may be increased or decreased according to our bylaws  provided that the total number of directors is not less than three nor more than pursuant to our bylaws  the number of directors will be fixed by our board of directors within the limits in our charter 
our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors 
directors for each class are chosen for a three year term when the term of the current class expires 
the staggered terms for directors may affect stockholders ability to effect a change in control of us  even if a change in control would be in the interest of our stockholders 
currently  there are seven directors 
removal of board of directors 
our charter provides that  except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of shares of capital stock other than our common stock  directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast for the election of directors 
vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by the concurring vote of a majority of the remaining directors and  in the case of a vacancy resulting from the removal of a director by the stockholders  by at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors 
preferred shares  classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval 
our charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that we have authority to issue is  initially consisting of  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock  of which  shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding as of december  our board of directors has the authority  without a vote of stockholders  to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock  including common stock into preferred stock or vice versa  and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred or other class or series of shares to be issued 
the issuance of preferred shares or other shares having special preferences or rights could delay  defer or prevent a change in control even if a change in control would be in the interests of our stockholders 
because our board of directors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of additional classes or series of shares without a stockholder vote  our board of directors may give the holders of any class or series preferences  powers and rights  including voting rights  senior to the rights of holders of our common stock 
consent rights of the limited partners 
under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership  we generally will be able to merge or consolidate with another entity with the consent of partners holding limited percentage interests that are more than of the aggregate percentage interests of the outstanding limited partnership interests entitled to vote on the merger or consolidation  including any limited partnership interests held by us  as long as the holders of limited partnership interests either receive or have the right to receive the same consideration as our stockholders 
we  as holder of a majority of the limited partnership interests  would be able to control the vote 
under our charter  holders of at least two thirds of our outstanding shares of common stock generally must approve the merger or consolidation 
maryland business combination law 
under the maryland general corporation law  specified business combinations  including specified issuances of equity securities  between a maryland corporation and any person who owns or more of the voting power of the corporation s then outstanding shares  or an interested stockholder  or an affiliate of the interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
thereafter  any of these specified business combinations must be approved by of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of outstanding voting shares and by two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of voting shares other than voting shares held by an interested stockholder unless  among other conditions  the corporation s common stockholders receive a minimum price  as defined in the maryland general corporation law  for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder 
we are subject to the maryland business combination statute 
maryland control share acquisition law 
under the maryland general corporation law  control shares acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter  excluding shares owned by the acquiror  by officers or by directors who are employees of the corporation 
control shares are voting shares which  if aggregated with all other voting shares previously acquired by the acquiror or over which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy  would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power one tenth or more but less than one third  one third or more but less than a majority or a majority or more of the voting power 
control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval 
a control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares  subject to specified exceptions 
we are subject to these control share provisions of maryland law 
merger  consolidation  share exchange and transfer of our assets 
pursuant to our charter  subject to the terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock  we can merge with or into another entity  consolidate with one or more other entities  participate in a share exchange or transfer our assets within the meaning of the maryland general corporation law if approved by our board of directors in the manner provided in the maryland general corporation law and by our stockholders holding two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter  except that any merger of us with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing our form of organization from a corporation to a trust requires only the approval of our stockholders holding a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the merger 
under the maryland general corporation law  specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange is only required to be approved by a maryland corporation by its board of directors if the corporation is the successor 
our voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter 
amendments to our charter and bylaws 
our charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transferability of our common stock  the classified board of directors  fixing the size of our board of directors within the range set forth in our charter  removal of directors and the filling of vacancies  all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the board of directors and approved by our stockholders holding two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter 
amendments of this provision of our charter also would require action of our board of directors and approval by stockholders holding two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter 
as permitted under the maryland general corporation law  our bylaws provide that directors have the exclusive right to amend our bylaws 
stockholder rights plan 
we adopted a stockholder rights plan which provides  among other things  that when specified events occur  our stockholders will be entitled to purchase from us a newly created class or series of junior preferred shares  subject to our ownership limit described below 
the preferred share purchase rights are triggered by the earlier to occur of ten days after the date of a public announcement that a person or group acting in concert has acquired  or obtained the right to acquire  beneficial ownership of or more of our outstanding shares of common stock or ten business days after the commencement of or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer  the consummation of which would result in the acquiring person becoming the beneficial owner of or more of our outstanding common stock 
the exercise of the preferred share purchase rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
there are possible adverse consequences of limits on ownership of our common stock 
to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  not more than in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals  as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities 
in addition  a person who owns  directly or by attribution  or more of an interest in a tenant of ours  or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner  cannot own  directly or by attribution  or more of our shares without jeopardizing our qualification as a reit 
primarily to facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the ownership limit under our charter prohibits ownership  directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the internal revenue code  by any person or persons acting as a group  of more than of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock  subject to an exception for shares of our common stock held prior to our conversion into a reit referred to as the reit conversion so long as the holder would not own more than in value of our outstanding shares after the reit conversion  and prohibits ownership  directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the internal revenue code  by any person  or persons acting as a group  of more than of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our preferred shares 
together  these limitations are referred to as the ownership limit 
our board of directors  in its sole and absolute discretion  may waive or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons who would not be treated as individuals for purposes of the internal revenue code if the board of directors is satisfied  based upon information required to be provided by the party seeking the waiver and  if it determines necessary or advisable  upon an opinion of counsel satisfactory to our board of directors  that ownership in excess of this limit will not cause a person who is an individual to be treated as owning shares in excess of the ownership limit  applying the applicable constructive ownership rules  and will not otherwise jeopardize our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes for example  by causing any of our tenants to be considered a related party tenant for purposes of the reit qualification rules 
common stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary  and the person who acquired the common stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions thereon  to vote those shares of common stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the common stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the common stock or the amount realized from the sale 
a transfer of shares of our common stock to a person who  as a result of the transfer  violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances  and  in any event  would deny that person any of the economic benefits of owning shares of our common stock in excess of the ownership limit 
the ownership limit may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control and  therefore  could adversely affect the stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for our common stock in connection with such transaction 
shares of our common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the price for shares of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the perception that sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
in addition  holders of units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership referred to as op units  whose op units are redeemed by the operating partnership in exchange for common stock  will be able to sell those shares freely  unless the person is our affiliate and resale of the affiliate s shares is not covered by an effective registration statement 
as of december   there are approximately million op units outstanding  all of which are currently redeemable 
further  a substantial number of shares of our common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans  including shares of our common stock reserved for options  and these shares of common stock would be available for sale in the public markets from time to time pursuant to exemptions from registration or upon registration 
moreover  additional shares of our common stock issued by us would be available in the future for sale in the public markets 
we can make no prediction about the effect that future sales of our common stock would have on the market price of our common stock 
our earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of our common stock 
we believe that the market value of a reit s equity securities is based primarily upon the market s perception of the reit s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions  whether from operations  sales  acquisitions  development or refinancings  and is secondarily based upon the value of the underlying assets 
for that reason  shares of our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share 
to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes  working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders  these retained funds  while increasing the value of our underlying assets  may negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
our failure to meet the market s expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
market interest rates may affect the price of shares of our common stock 
we believe that one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a reit is the distribution rate on the shares  considered as a percentage of the price of the shares  relative to market interest rates 
if market interest rates increase  prospective purchasers of reit shares may expect a higher distribution rate 
thus  higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our shares to go down 
federal income tax risks recent changes in taxable of corporate dividends may adversely affect the value of our stock 
while corporate dividends have traditionally been taxed at ordinary income rates  dividends received by individuals through december  from regular c corporations generally will be taxed at the maximum capital gains tax rate of as opposed to the maximum ordinary income tax rate of 
reit dividends are not eligible for the lower capital gains rates  except in certain circumstances where the dividends are attributable to income that has been subject to corporate level tax 
while the earnings of a reit that are distributed to its stockholders generally will be subject to less federal income taxation than earnings of a non reit c corporation that are distributed to its stockholders net of corporate level income tax  this difference in the taxation of dividends could cause individual investors to view the stock of regular c corporations as more attractive relative to the stock of reits 
individual investors could hold this view because the dividends from regular c corporations will generally be taxed at a lower rate while dividends from reits will generally be taxed at the same rate as the individual s other ordinary income 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  this difference in the taxation of dividends may have on the value of the stock of reits  either in terms of price or relative to other potential investments 
to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income  irrespective of our available cash or outstanding obligations 
to continue to qualify as a reit  we currently are required to distribute to our stockholders with respect to each year at least of our taxable income  excluding net capital gain 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which distributions made by us with respect to the calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income and of our capital gain net income for that year and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods less excess distributions from prior years 
we intend to make distributions  subject to the availability of cash and in compliance with any debt covenants  to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirement and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax and will rely for this purpose on distributions from the operating partnership 
however  there are differences in timing between our recognition of taxable income and our receipt of cash available for distribution due to  among other things  the seasonality of the lodging industry and the fact that some taxable income will be phantom income  which is taxable income that is not matched by cash flow to us 
due to some transactions entered into in years prior to the reit conversion  we could recognize substantial amounts of phantom income 
it is possible that these timing differences could require us to borrow funds or to issue additional equity to enable us to meet the distribution requirement and  therefore  to maintain our reit status  and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax 
in addition  because the reit distribution requirements prevent us from retaining earnings  we will generally be required to refinance debt that matures with additional debt or equity 
we cannot assure you that any of the sources of funds  if available at all  would be sufficient to meet our distribution and tax obligations 
adverse tax consequences would apply if we failed to qualify as a reit 
we believe that we have been organized and have operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  commencing with our taxable year beginning january   and we currently intend to continue to operate as a reit during future years 
no assurance can be provided  however  that we qualify as a reit or that new legislation  treasury regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of our reit qualification 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we will not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income  and we will be subject to federal and state income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
in addition  unless entitled to statutory relief  we would not qualify as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which reit qualification is lost 
any determination that we do not qualify as a reit would have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce the value of our common stock materially 
the additional tax liability to us for the year or years in which we did not qualify would reduce our net earnings available for investment  debt service or distribution to our stockholders 
furthermore  we would no longer be required to make any distributions to stockholders as a condition to reit qualification and all of our distributions to stockholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits  or e p 
this means that stockholders taxed as individuals currently would be taxes on those dividends at capital gains rates and corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends  subject in each case  to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code 
our failure to qualify as a reit also would cause an event of default under our credit facility that could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due under the credit facility  which  in turn  would constitute an event of default under our outstanding debt securities 
we will be disqualified as a reit at least for taxable year if we failed to distribute all of our e p attributable to our non reit taxable years 
in order to qualify as a reit  we cannot have at the end of any taxable year any undistributed e p that is attributable to one of our non reit taxable years 
a reit has until the close of its first taxable year as a reit in which it has non reit e p to distribute its accumulated e p 
we were required to have distributed this e p prior to the end of  the first taxable year for which our reit election was effective 
if we failed to do this  we will be disqualified as a reit at least for taxable year we believe that distributions of non reit e p that we made were sufficient to distribute all of the non reit e p as of december   but we cannot provide assurance that we met this requirement 
if our leases are not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes  we would fail to qualify as a reit 
to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy two gross income tests  under which specified percentages of our gross income must be passive income  like rent 
for the rent paid pursuant to the leases  which constitutes substantially all of our gross income  to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests  the leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts  joint ventures or some other type of arrangement 
in addition  the lessees must not be regarded as related party tenants  as defined in the internal revenue code 
we believe that the leases will be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs will agree with this view 
we also believe that crestline  the lessee of substantially all of our full service hotels prior to january   was not a related party tenant and  as a result of changes in the tax laws effective january   hmt lessee  llc  or hmt lessee  will not be treated as a related party tenant so long as it qualifies as a taxable reit subsidiary 
if the leases were not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes or if the lessees were regarded as related party tenants  we would not be able to satisfy either of the two gross income tests applicable to reits and we would lose our reit status 
see risk factors federal income tax risks adverse tax consequences would apply if we failed to qualify as a reit above 
if hmt lessee llc fails to qualify as a taxable reit subsidiary  we would fail to qualify as a reit 
for our taxable years beginning on and after january   as a result of reit tax law changes under the specific provisions of the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of  which we refer to as the reit modernization act  we are permitted to lease our hotels to a subsidiary of the operating partnership that is taxable as a corporation and that elects to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary 
accordingly  hmt lessee has directly or indirectly acquired all of the full service hotel leasehold interests from third parties 
so long as hmt lessee and other affiliated lessees qualify as taxable reit subsidiaries of ours  they will not be treated as related party tenants 
we believe that hmt lessee qualifies to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes 
we cannot assure you  however  that the irs will not challenge its status as a taxable reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes  or that a court would not sustain such a challenge 
if the irs were successful in disqualifying hmt lessee from treatment as a taxable reit subsidiary  we would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to reits and substantially all of our income would fail to qualify for the gross income tests and  accordingly  we would cease to qualify as a reit 
see risk factors federal income tax risks adverse tax consequences would apply if we failed to qualify as a reit above 
despite our reit status  we remain subject to various taxes  including substantial deferred and contingent tax liabilities 
notwithstanding our status as a reit  we are subject  through our ownership interest in the operating partnership  to certain federal  state  local and foreign taxes on our income and property 
in addition  we will be required to pay federal income tax at the highest regular corporate rate upon our share of any built in gain recognized as a result of any sale before january   by the operating partnership of assets  including the hotels  in which interests were acquired by the operating partnership from our predecessor and its subsidiaries as part of the reit conversion 
built in gain is the amount by which an asset s fair market value exceeded our adjusted basis in the asset on january   the first day of our first taxable year as a reit 
the total amount of gain on which we would be subject to corporate income tax if the assets that we held at the time of the reit conversion were sold in a taxable transaction prior to january  would be material to us 
in addition  at the time of the reit conversion  we expected that we or rockledge hotel properties  inc or fernwood hotel assets  inc  or rockledge and fernwood  respectively each of which is a taxable corporation in which the operating partnership owned a nonvoting interest and  as of april   acquired of the voting interests and each of which  elected to be a taxable reit subsidiary effective january   likely would recognize substantial built in gain and deferred tax liabilities in the next ten years without any corresponding receipt of cash by us or the operating partnership 
we may have to pay certain state income taxes because not all states treat reits the same as they are treated for federal income tax purposes 
we may also have to pay certain foreign taxes to the extent we own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions 
the operating partnership is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes and any related interest and penalties incurred by us  as well as any liabilities that the irs or the tax authorities successfully may assert against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time we qualified as a reit 
our taxable reit subsidiaries  including rockledge  fernwood and hmt lessee  are taxable as corporations and will pay federal  state and local income tax on their net income at the applicable corporate rates  and foreign taxes to the extent they own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions 
if the irs were to challenge successfully the operating partnership s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  we would cease to qualify as a reit and suffer other adverse consequences 
we believe that the operating partnership qualifies to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
as a partnership  it is not subject to federal income tax on its income 
instead  each of its partners  including us  is required to pay tax on its allocable share of the operating partnership s income 
no assurance can be provided  however  that the irs will not challenge its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  or that a court would not sustain such a challenge 
if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for tax purposes  we would fail to meet the income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to reits and  accordingly  cease to qualify as a reit 
if the operating partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or we fail to qualify as a reit  either failure would cause an event of default under our credit facility that  in turn  could constitute an event of default under our outstanding debt securities 
also  the failure of the operating partnership to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax  which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners  including us 
finally  the classification of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause us to recognize gain at least equal to our negative capital account  if any 
as a reit  we are subject to limitations on our ownership of debt and equity securities 
subject to the exceptions discussed in this paragraph  a reit is prohibited from owning securities in any one issuer to the extent that the value of those securities exceeds of the value of the reit s total assets or the securities owned by the reit represent more than of the issuer s outstanding voting securities or more than of the value of the issuer s outstanding securities 
a reit is permitted to own securities of a subsidiary in an amount that exceeds the value test and the vote or value test if the subsidiary elects to be a taxable reit subsidiary  which is taxable as a corporation 
however  a reit may not own securities of taxable reit subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than of the value of the reit s total assets 
our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to special rules that may result in increased taxes 
several internal revenue code provisions ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation 
for example  a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated reit 
in addition  the reit has to pay a penalty tax on some payments that it receives if the economic arrangements between the reit and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties 
we may be required to pay a penalty tax upon the sale of a hotel 
the federal income tax provisions applicable to reits provide that any gain realized by a reit on the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a penalty tax 
under existing law  whether property  including hotels  is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is a question of fact that depends upon all of the facts and circumstances with respect to the particular transaction 
the operating partnership intends that it and its subsidiaries will hold the hotels for investment with a view to long term appreciation  to engage in the business of acquiring and owning hotels and to make occasional sales of hotels as are consistent with the operating partnership s investment objectives 
we cannot assure you  however  that the irs might not contend that one or more of these sales is subject to the penalty tax
