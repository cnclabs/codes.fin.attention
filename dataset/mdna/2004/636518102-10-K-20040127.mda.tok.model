two of the four directors of the national instruments foundation are current officers of national instruments 
interest income and expense 
interest income decreased in from  which followed a decrease of in from and a decrease of in from the decrease in interest income in each year was due to lower yields on the company s investments 
the primary source of interest income is from the investment of the company s cash 
net cash provided by operating activities in totaled million 
net foreign exchange gain loss 
the company experienced net foreign exchange gains of million in  compared to losses of  in and losses of million in these results are attributable to movements between the us dollar and the local currencies in countries in which the company s subsidiaries are located 
the company recognizes the local currency as the functional currency of its international subsidiaries 
the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a majority of its foreign currency denominated receivables in order to reduce its exposure to significant foreign currency fluctuations 
the company typically limits the duration of its receivables foreign currency forward contracts to days 
the company also utilizes foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency purchased option contracts in order to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in future foreign currency cash flows 
the company purchases these contracts for up to of its forecasted cash flows in selected currencies primarily the euro  yen and pound sterling and limits the duration of these contracts to months 
the foreign currency purchased option contracts are purchased at the money or out of the money 
as a result  the company s hedging activities only partially address its risks in foreign currency transactions  and there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
the company does not invest in contracts for speculative purposes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s forward and purchased option contracts and hedged positions 
the company s hedging strategy reduced the foreign exchange gains for december  by million and increased the net foreign exchange loss for december  by million 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of in  in and in the decrease in the effective rate resulted from income tax benefits attributable to the extraterritorial income exclusion and a change in the distribution of income among taxing jurisdictions  particularly the impact of the company s manufacturing facility in hungary 
the company s effective tax rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate of primarily as a result of the extraterritorial income exclusion  tax exempt interest and reduced tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources the company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
at december   the company had working capital of approximately million compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december   as a result of higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of days sales outstanding at december  increased to days from days at december  consolidated inventory balances have decreased to million at december  from million at december  inventory turns of per year for represent an increase from turns of per year for cash used in for the purchase of property and equipment totaled million  for the capitalization of internally developed software costs totaled million  for acquisitions totaled million and for additions to other intangibles totaled million 
cash used in for the purchase of property and equipment totaled million  for the capitalization of internally developed software costs totaled million and for additions to other intangibles totaled million 
cash used in for the purchase of property and equipment totaled million  for the capitalization of internally developed software costs totaled million and for additions to other intangibles totaled million 
cash provided by the issuance of common stock totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  and cash used for payment of dividends totaled million in the issuance of common stock was primarily to employees under the employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
the following summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total beyond long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases       other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations       the following summarizes the company s other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands total beyond guarantees   purchase obligations   total commercial commitments   the company currently expects to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from a combination of available cash and short term investment balances and internally generated funds 
as of december  and  the company had no debt outstanding 
the company believes that the cash flow from operations  if any  existing cash balances and short term investments  will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend on the company s profitability  its ability to manage working capital requirements and its rate of growth 
financial risk management the company s international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the company s sales outside of north america are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the company is subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
in particular  increases in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies decrease the us dollar value of foreign sales requiring the company either to increase its price in the local currency  which could render the company s product prices noncompetitive  or to suffer reduced revenues and gross margins as measured in us dollars 
these dynamics have adversely affected revenue growth in international markets in previous years 
the company s foreign currency hedging program includes both foreign currency forward and purchased option contracts to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  the hedging program will not eliminate all of the company s foreign exchange risks 
see net foreign exchange gain loss and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the marketplace for the company s products dictates that many of the company s products be shipped very quickly after an order is received 
as a result  the company is required to maintain significant inventories 
therefore  inventory obsolescence is a risk for the company due to frequent engineering changes  shifting customer demand  the emergence of new industry standards and rapid technological advances including the introduction by the company or its competitors of products embodying new technology 
while the company maintains valuation allowances for excess and obsolete inventories and management continues to monitor the adequacy of such valuation allowances  there can be no assurance that such valuation allowances will be sufficient 
the company has no debt or off balance sheet debt 
as of december   the company has non cancelable operating lease obligations of approximately million and contractual purchase commitments with various suppliers of general components and customized inventory components of approximately million 
as of december   the company has outstanding guarantees for payment of foreign operating leases  customs and foreign grants totaling approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
as such  the company is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company were engaged in such relationships 
market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of its investments 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of its investments 
foreign currency hedging activities 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in such exchange rates on the company s earnings and cash flow 
accordingly  the company utilizes purchased foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts to hedge its exposure on anticipated transactions and firm commitments 
the principal currencies hedged are the euro  british pound and japanese yen 
the company monitors its foreign exchange exposures regularly to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
based on the foreign exchange instruments outstanding at december   an adverse change defined as in the asian currencies and in all other currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in the aggregate fair market value of all instruments outstanding of approximately million 
however  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  management believes that a loss in fair value for those instruments will be substantially offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s financial instruments at december  and short term investments 
the fair value of the company s investments in marketable securities at december  was million 
investments with maturities beyond one year are classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
the company s investment policy is to manage its investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
the company diversifies the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
the company s investment portfolio is primarily invested in securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
based on the company s investment portfolio and interest rates at december   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of approximately  respectively  in the fair value of the investment portfolio 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
recently issued accounting pronouncement in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  it is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are as follows o revenue recognition revenue from the sale and licensing of products is generally recognized on the date the product is shipped to the customer 
revenue related to the sale of maintenance contracts is deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the service period 
o estimating allowances  specifically sales returns  the allowance for doubtful accounts and the valuation allowance for excess and obsolete inventories the preparation of financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  the company must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of its products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
the allowance for sales returns was million at december  material differences may result in the amount and timing of the company s revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
similarly  management must make estimates of the uncollectability of the company s accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based on assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
the valuation allowance for excess and obsolete inventories was million at december  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
o accounting for costs of computer software the company capitalizes costs related to the development and acquisition of certain software products 
capitalization of costs begins when technological feasibility has been established and ends when the product is available for general release to customers 
amortization is computed on an individual product basis for those products available for market and has been recognized based on the product s estimated economic life  generally three years 
at each balance sheet date  the unamortized costs are reviewed by management and reduced to net realized value when necessary 
as of december   unamortized capitalized software development costs was million 
o valuation of long lived and intangible assets the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the measurement of any impairment is determined and the carrying value is reduced as appropriate 
as of december   the company had net goodwill of approximately million 
o accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events are considered other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts which are more likely than not to be realized 
o loss contingencies the company accrues for probable losses from contingencies including legal defense costs  on an undiscounted basis  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for loss contingencies  when such costs are considered probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable 
the company periodically evaluates available information  both internal and external  relative to such contingencies and adjusts this accrual as necessary 
factors affecting the company s business and prospects us global economic slowdown 
as occurred in recent years  the markets in which the company does business could again experience the negative effects of a slowdown in the us and or global economies 
additionally  the company could be impacted by the effects of any recurrence of the sars virus  either through increased difficulty or costs for the export of products into affected regions  the import of components used in the company s products from affected regions  and or the effects the virus or costs to contain the virus have on the economy in regions in which the company does business  particularly asia  which has been the highest growth region of the company over the past two years 
the company could also be subject to or impacted by acts of terrorism and or the effects that war or continued us military action would have on the us and or global economies 
the worsening of the us or global economies could result in reduced purchasing and capital spending in any of the markets served by the company which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
budgets 
the company has established an operating budget for the company s spending for could exceed this budget due to a number of factors  including additional marketing costs for conferences and tradeshows  increased costs from the over hiring of product development engineers or other personnel  increased manufacturing costs resulting from component supply shortages and or component price fluctuations and or additional expenses related to intellectual property litigation 
any future decreased demand for the company s products could result in decreased revenue and could require the company to revise its budget and reduce expenditures 
exceeding the established operating budget or failing to reduce expenditures in response to any decrease in revenue could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
risk of component shortages 
as has occurred in the past  and as may be expected to occur in the future  supply shortages of components used in our products  including sole source components  can result in significant additional costs and inefficiencies in manufacturing 
if the company is unsuccessful in resolving any such component shortages  it will experience a significant impact on the timing of revenue and or an increase in manufacturing costs  either of which would have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including changes in the mix of products sold  the availability and pricing of components from third parties especially sole sources  the timing of orders  level of pricing of international sales  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the difficulty in maintaining margins  including the higher margins traditionally achieved in international sales  and changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or suppliers 
specifically  if the local currencies in which the company sells weaken against the us dollar  and if the local sales prices cannot be raised  the company will experience a deterioration of its gross and net profit margins 
if the us dollar strengthens in the future  it could have a material adverse effect on gross and net profit margins 
as has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future  new software products of the company or new operating systems of third parties on which the company s products are based  often contain bugs or errors that can result in reduced sales and or cause the company s support costs to increase  either of which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
furthermore  the company has significant revenues from customers in industries such as semiconductors  automated test equipment  telecommunications  aerospace  defense and automotive which are cyclical in nature 
downturns in these industries could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in recent years  the company s revenues have been characterized by seasonality  with revenues typically being relatively constant in the first  second and third quarters  growing in the fourth quarter and being relatively flat or declining from the fourth quarter of the year to the first quarter of the following year 
the company believes the seasonality of its revenue results from the international mix of its revenue and the variability of the budgeting and purchasing cycles of its customers throughout each international region 
in addition  total operating expenses have in the past tended to be higher in the second and third quarters of each year  due to recruiting and increased intern personnel expenses 
new product introductions and market acceptance 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and frequent new product introductions  and is therefore highly dependent upon timely product innovation 
the company s success is dependent on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis to replace declining revenues from older products  and on increasing penetration in domestic and international markets 
in the past  the company has experienced significant delays between the announcement and the commercial availability of new products 
any significant delay in releasing new products could have a material adverse effect on the ultimate success of a product and other related products and could impede continued sales of predecessor products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to introduce new products in accordance with announced release dates  that new products will achieve market acceptance or that any such acceptance will be sustained for any significant period 
failure of new products to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with the company s efforts to increase foreign market penetration 
risks associated with increased development of web site 
the company has devoted significant resources in developing its web site as a key marketing and sales tool and expects to continue to do so in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its attempt to leverage the web to increase sales 
the company hosts its web site internally 
any failure to successfully maintain the web site and to protect it from attack could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operating results 
operation in intensely competitive markets 
the markets in which the company operates are characterized by intense competition from numerous competitors  some of which are divisions of large corporations having far greater resources than the company  and the company expects to face further competition from new market entrants in the future 
a key competitor is agilent technologies inc agilent 
agilent offers its own line of instrument controllers  and also offers hardware and software add on products for third party desktop computers and workstations that provide solutions that directly compete with the company s virtual instrumentation products 
agilent is aggressively advertising and marketing products that are competitive with the company s products 
because of agilent s strong position in the instrumentation business  changes in its marketing strategy or product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company believes its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside its control  including new product introductions by competitors  product pricing  quality and performance  success in developing new products  adequate manufacturing capacity and supply of components and materials  efficiency of manufacturing operations  effectiveness of sales and marketing resources and strategies  strategic relationships with other suppliers  timing of new product introductions by the company  protection of the company s products by effective use of intellectual property laws  general market and economic conditions  and government actions throughout the world 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
management information systems 
during  the company successfully upgraded its america s business applications suite to oracle s latest web based release i 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties with the new system 
difficulties with the system may interrupt normal company operations  including the ability to provide quotes  process orders  ship products  provide services and support to its customers  bill and track its customers  fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run its business 
any disruptions of the system may have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in  the company also continued development of its web offerings 
in  the company will be focusing on the upgrade of its european business applications suite to oracle s latest web based release i  as well as the management information system for the company s current warehouse facilities  and will continue to devote significant resources to the development of the company s web offerings 
any failure to successfully implement these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company relies on three primary regional centers for its management information systems 
as with any information system  unforeseen issues may arise that could affect management s ability to receive adequate  accurate and timely financial information which in turn could inhibit effective and timely decisions 
furthermore  it is possible that one or more of the company s three regional information systems could experience a complete or partial shutdown 
if such a shutdown occurred near the end of a quarter it could impact the company s product shipments and revenues  as product distribution is heavily dependent on the integrated management information systems in each region 
accordingly  operating results in that quarter would be adversely impacted 
the company is working to achieve reliable regional management information systems to control costs and improve its ability to deliver its products in substantially all of its direct markets worldwide 
no assurance can be given that the company s efforts will be successful 
the failure to receive adequate  accurate and timely financial information could inhibit management s ability to make effective and timely decisions 
risks associated with international operations and foreign economies 
international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the company must also comply with various import and export regulations 
failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines and or termination of import and export privileges  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
additionally  the regulatory environment in some countries is very restrictive as their governments try to protect their local economy and value of their local currency against the us dollar 
sales made by the company s international direct sales offices are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates 
net of hedging results  the change in exchange rates had the effect of increasing the company s consolidated sales by million  or  in compared to since most of the company s international operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies  the change in exchange rates had the effect of increasing operating expenses by million for compared to if the us dollar weakens in the future  it could result in the company having to reduce prices locally in order for its products to remain competitive in the local marketplace 
if the us dollar strengthens in the future and the company is unable to successfully raise its international selling prices  it could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results 
expansion of manufacturing capacity 
during  the company completed construction of a second manufacturing facility 
this facility is located in hungary and became operational in the fourth quarter of this facility sources a significant portion of the company s sales 
currently the company is continuing to develop and implement information systems to support the operation of this facility 
this facility and its operation are also subject to risks associated with a relatively new manufacturing facility and with doing business internationally  including difficulty in managing manufacturing operations in a foreign country  difficulty in achieving or maintaining product quality  interruption to transportation flows for delivery of components to us and finished goods to our customers  and changes in the country s political or economic conditions 
no assurance can be given that the company s efforts will be successful 
accordingly  any failure to deal with these factors could result in interruption in the facility s operation or delays in expanding its capacity  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
income tax rate 
the company established a manufacturing facility in hungary in as a result of certain foreign investment incentives available under hungarian law  the profit from the company s hungarian operation is currently exempt from income tax 
these benefits may not be available in the future due to changes in hungary s political condition and or tax laws 
the reduction or elimination of these foreign investment incentives would result in the reduction or elimination of certain tax benefits thereby increasing the company s future effective income tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company receives a substantial income tax benefit from the extraterritorial income exemption eti under us law 
the eti rules provide that a percentage of the profits from products and intangibles exported from the us are exempt from us tax 
this benefit may not be available in the future as the eti has been ruled an illegal export subsidy by the world trade organization 
the repeal of the eti would result in the elimination of this tax benefit thereby increasing the company s future effective income tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
products dependent on certain industries 
sales of the company s products are dependent on customers in certain industries  particularly the telecommunications  semiconductor  automotive  automated test equipment  defense and aerospace industries 
as experienced in the past  and as may be expected to occur in the future  downturns characterized by diminished product demand in any one or more of these industries could result in decreased sales  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
dependence on key suppliers 
the company s manufacturing processes use large volumes of high quality components and subassemblies supplied by outside sources 
several of these components are available through sole or limited sources 
sole source components purchased by the company include custom application specific integrated circuits asics and other components 
the company has in the past experienced delays and quality problems in connection with sole source components  and there can be no assurance that these problems will not recur in the future 
accordingly  the failure to receive sole source components from suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and operating results 
stock based compensation plans 
the company has two active stock based compensation plans and one inactive plan 
the two active stock based compensation plans are the incentive stock option plan and the employee stock purchase plan 
the company currently adheres to the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
as amended by sfas no
