the company expects that the sources of its revenues and its cost structure may be different in future periods  both as a result of its entry into new communications markets and competitive forces in each of the markets in which the company has operations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement between the company and the customer exists  ii delivery of the product to the customer has occurred or service has been provided to the customer  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
revenues based on a flat fee  derived principally from local telephone  dedicated network access  data communications  internet access service  residential business broadband service and non contract wireless services  are billed in advance and recognized in subsequent periods when the services are provided

to all wireless handset sales below cost  which approximates fair value in the absence of an activation subsidy  when it receives an up front fee of any kind eg  a service activation fee

the company provides a general right of return within the first days of service for a refund of the handset cost 
the estimated equipment return allowance associated with this right of return is estimated based on historical experience 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
treasury investigation and internal control matters in january  the audit committee of the board of directors launched a formal investigation and retained independent legal counsel to conduct the investigation with the assistance of forensic accountants 
the investigation resulted from a preliminary investigation by company management  triggered by the abrupt resignation in december of an employee in the company s corporate finance department 
the investigation indicated irregularities by the former employee in the company s cash management and investment functions  and violations of the company s investment policies 
at the time of the commencement of the special investigation  approximately  of company funds were outstanding without proper documentation  and such funds remain outstanding  and have been reflected as a non operating loss in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the independent legal counsel  with the assistance of the forensic accountants  undertook an extensive process to i investigate the facts and circumstances giving rise to the misappropriation of company funds  ii determine whether there were any similar or related transactions  and any company employees involved in the previously identified transactions other than those known to the company at the commencement of the investigation  iii determine the underlying mechanics in the origination of the transactions and the circumstances under which detection failed to occur  and iv evaluate internal controls relating to the affected portion of the company s business 
the audit committee of the board of directors has been advised by independent legal counsel that o all of the unauthorized transactions occurred in and remained undetected until december  o the unauthorized transactions were actively concealed by the company s former employee in the company s books and records  and o independent legal counsel did not uncover any other similar transactions nor any evidence that any other company employees intentionally participated in the unauthorized transactions 
the independent legal counsel further reported to the audit committee  i its view that existing company control procedures prior to the discovery of the unauthorized transactions were either circumvented or ignored  and the control procedures existing at the time of the unauthorized transactions were not adequate  and ii the company  subsequent to the discovery of the unauthorized transactions  had developed and implemented a number of key internal controls 
in addition  the independent legal counsel provided additional control recommendations to the audit committee for review and consideration 
in connection with the audit of the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   ernst young llp  the company s independent auditors  advised the company that it had concluded that material weaknesses in the company s internal control existed  including with respect to certain of the issues identified as a result of the audit committee s special investigation 
the company has performed substantial additional procedures designed to ensure that the internal control deficiencies did not lead to material misstatements in its consolidated financial statements  notwithstanding the presence of the noted internal control weaknesses 
both before and after december   the company instituted additional processes and procedures to improve internal control 
subsequent to the discovery of the unauthorized wire transactions in  the company implemented a number of internal controls with respect to banking and investment activities 
the audit committee has made a number of additional recommendations to the company s board of directors for further review and consideration  which the company believes will be formally acted upon beginning early in the second quarter of  and thereafter 
such initiatives relate to o an assessment to be conducted with respect to the company s corporate finance department  which encompasses the company s accounting and finance personnel  including specifically relating to the number of personnel  and the collective mix and technical skills of such personnel  and the addition of new personnel if necessary  o an internal audit process  with tasks to be performed either by company personnel or a third party  with reporting duties to the chairman of the company s audit committee  o a more significant effort devoted to internal controls training for all affected personnel  and an increased emphasis on the completion of internal controls documentation  including as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of including the possible retention of a third party to assist in performing internal control reviews of all of the company s accounting systems  and to assist in expediting the completion of the internal controls documentation  and o the preparation and implementation of a formal accounting policies and procedures manual or electronic database to serve as a reference tool for company personnel and to establish uniformity and consistency throughout the company 
the company has previously taken actions that it believes have improved internal controls  including o the establishment of a disclosure committee comprised of management personnel and senior representatives of the company s corporate finance department  which undertakes reviews prior to significant filings with the securities and exchange commission  o the modification of written ethics and compliance materials provided to company employees  and the formal adoption of a code of ethics and business conduct  and the related establishment of confidential procedures which permit company employees to communicate anonymously in the event of suspected violations of laws or company standards together with upcoming mandatory classes in for all company employees to review the code of ethics and business conduct  and o the implementation in of new enterprise resource planning and accounting software  which likely assisted in identifying certain of the accounting deficiencies noted above relating to property  plant and equipment 
the company in also anticipates improving modules in its new software and undertaking revised physical verification and other procedures to improve its accounting for property  plant and equipment 
the company has filed an insurance claim to recover the missing funds and has filed a civil lawsuit seeking to recover  and other costs from five individuals and a private company allegedly associated with the fraudulent scheme to illegally transfer the company s funds to outside accounts 
the company will recognize a recovery of funds in future periods to the extent of its insurance and litigation recoveries 
the company has engaged in informal discussion with the securities and exchange commission  which has been in possession of certain background information  regarding the facts and circumstances of the unauthorized funds transfers 
the company has provided supplemental information to the securities and exchange commission regarding the results of the investigation  including with respect to the report by independent legal counsel to the audit committee  and anticipates it will be providing additional information in response to further requests

triple play subscribers are customers who receive digital video  voice and or data services from the surewest broadband residential services 
the broadband segment can deliver multiple services to a customer 
accordingly  the company maintains statistical data regarding the latest number of various revenue generating units for digital video  voice and data  in addition to the number of customers 
for example  a single customer who purchases digital video  voice and data services would be reflected as three revenue generating units 
broadband operating revenues increased  and  in and  respectively  as compared to each prior year period 
during and  the broadband segment experienced substantial increases in the number of dsl subscribers and isp and custom data subscribers 
more significantly  this segment had  triple play subscribers and  revenue generating units at december  within the company s surewest broadband residential services business  which commenced in july as a result of the acquisition of assets from western integrated networks  llc and affiliated companies 
while continuing to produce significant revenue increases  the expansion of the broadband business has and will continue to require significant capital and expense commitments 
accordingly  the broadband segment incurred larger year over year operating and net losses in the years and the wireless segment also reported increases in operating revenues of  and  in and  respectively  as compared to each prior year period 
the number of wireless subscribers increased to  at december   representing a increase for the years surewest wireless established its market share in the sacramento market in large part by promoting an unlimited flat rate regional calling plan 
wireless customer acquisition has historically been most active during the december holiday season  and the company has always been active in sales and marketing at this time 
during  surewest wireless initiated a number of new service options for customers  including new regional plans and in will launch a family plan and new vertical services such as wireless data capabilities 
evolution of the marketplace has caused surewest wireless to open four retail stores in its service area 
it is also seeking to expand its service penetration among major accounts in surewest wireless will seek to reduce customer churn and to increase the amount of revenue it derives from each customer in while the company continues to experience growth from the broadband and wireless segments  the company s telecom segment operations are facing the competitive and regulatory challenges now faced by incumbent local exchange carriers ilec s both nationally and in california 
for the first time in recent history  surewest telephone had a decline in access lines  primarily due to increased competition from wireless services 
telecom s operating revenues decreased  in as compared to  and were also below reported revenues 
operating and net income also declined  and  respectively  in as compared to while the telecom operating revenues continue to generate a majority of the company s revenues and yield significant cash flows and net income  the company believes that the telecom segments results in recent years support the company s decision to enter and commit resources to newer businesses  particularly in the broadband segment 
the company s operating expenses increased due to an increase in cost of services and products expense associated with a larger number of subscribers and services  including a full year of expense in from surewest broadband residential services  as described above 
general and administrative expenses increased as a result of i an increase in employee headcount necessary to provide the company s services  including a full year of expense in from surewest broadband residential services business  ii an increase in medical insurance costs  resulting from an increase in the number of employees and higher per employee cost and iii an increase in corporate insurance costs 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  in and  in 
a substantial portion of this increase results from additions to property  plant and equipment  primarily within the broadband and wireless segments 
the increase in depreciation expense was offset in part by a change in accounting estimate during the fourth quarter of  which increased from five to ten years the estimated useful lives related primarily to wireless switching and voice mail equipment 
this change in accounting estimate resulted in decreased depreciation expense of and in and  respectively 
adjustments and eliminations during the company s financial statement closing process for the year ended december   certain matters were identified related to prior financial reporting periods that necessitated the recording of adjustments to the company s consolidated financial statements 
such adjustments pertained principally to property  plant and equipment  and management believes that weaknesses in the company s internal controls caused the errors that resulted in these adjustments 
the company does not believe any of the aforementioned amounts are material  individually or in the aggregate  to the respective prior annual periods based on both quantitative and qualitative factors  including the trend of operating results  nor does it believe the prospective correction of such amounts during the quarter ended december  is material to the company s consolidated results of operations based on both quantitative and qualitative factors  including the trend of operating results 
the prospective correction of the aforementioned amounts relating to prior periods reduced the company s consolidated net income by  or per basic and diluted share  and would have reduced the company s and consolidated net income by  or per basic and diluted share  and  or per basic and diluted share  respectively  had such errors been corrected in the periods in which they originated 
the company s and consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to eliminate certain intercompany balances that were not previously eliminated 
these adjustments pertained to i the company s december  intercompany accounts receivable and accounts payable balances aggregating  and ii certain of the company s and intercompany revenue and operating expense balances aggregating  and  respectively

these decreases to operating revenues during were partially offset by continued growth and demand for dedicated access  the introduction of ethernet service in mid and an increase in surewest telephone s billing surcharge 
the decrease in operating revenues in the telecom segment was also offset  in part  by a final settlement agreement the settlement agreement surewest telephone entered into during as discussed in greater detail in the regulatory matters section  the settlement agreement provided for a  refund from another telecommunications company for a payment made by the surewest telephone in related to interstate shareable earnings obligations 
surewest telephone s operating revenues were also affected by the commencement of a wholesaling arrangement in the fourth quarter of for its dsl service 
this wholesaling arrangement resulted in a decrease to network access revenues of  for the year ended december  compared to the company adopted sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  effective january   which requires non recurring revenues associated with service and activation charges to be deferred 
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle on the company was a decrease of  net of tax  per share in for the years ended december  and  the telecom segment recognized and  respectively  of revenues that were in the cumulative effect adjustment as of january  the effect of those revenues was to increase income by net of income taxes of and net of income taxes of for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating expenses operating expenses for the telecom segment decreased  compared to cost of services and products decreased  or  during due primarily to an increase in allocation of resources provided to other affiliates 
customer operations and selling expense decreased  or  during due primarily to i internal efficiencies resulting from integrated customer support systems and productivity gains and ii a decrease in brand advertising expenses

this increase was offset in part by bad debt expense recognized during associated with access charge billings to an interexchange carrier that filed for bankruptcy protection as described in more detail below 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased  during due primarily to additions to central office assets  cable and wire facilities and internal use software 
certain of the company s customers filed for bankruptcy protection in  the most notable of which was worldcom  inc worldcom  which  together with its affiliates  filed for bankruptcy protection on july  as a result of the bankruptcy filing  the company recognized bad debt expense of approximately  in relating to amounts owed from worldcom to the company for services prior to the bankruptcy filing 
with respect to post petition obligations  worldcom had proposed  pursuant to a provision of the bankruptcy code  and the bankruptcy court has agreed  that utilities including ilec s are entitled to adequate assurances that worldcom will satisfy its obligations for post petition services 
the bankruptcy court provided  with respect to any post petition services provided after august   that all utilities will have a junior superiority administrative claim senior to other administrative claims and junior only to the claims of worldcom s post petition lenders 
if worldcom fails to pay for post petition services  a utility can either take appropriate action under any applicable tariff or regulation  or seek  on an expedited basis  an order from the bankruptcy court requiring immediate payment or other relief 
as of december   obligations owed by worldcom to the company for post petition services have been paid on a timely basis 
regulatory matters revenues from services subject to regulation constituted approximately of the company s total operating revenues in such revenues  which include local and network access services  are derived from various sources  including o business and residential subscribers  for basic exchange services o surcharges  mandated by the california public utilities commission cpuc o long distance carriers  for network access service o competitive access providers and subscribers  for network access services o interstate pool settlements  from the national exchange carrier association neca o support payments from the universal service fund o support payments from the california high cost fund chcf  recovering costs of services including extended area service 
revenues from certain telephone services are affected by rates authorized by various regulatory agencies 
intrastate service rates are subject to regulation by the cpuc 
with respect to toll calls initiated by interexchange carriers customers  the interexchange carriers are assessed access charges based on tariffs filed by surewest telephone 
interstate access rates and resulting earnings are subject to regulation by the federal communications commission fcc 
with respect to interstate services  surewest telephone has filed its own tariff with the fcc for all elements of access services except carrier common line charges  for which surewest telephone concurs with tariffs filed by neca 
the fcc monitors surewest telephone s interstate earnings through the use of annual cost separation studies prepared by surewest telephone  which utilize estimated cost information and projected demand usage 
the fcc establishes rules that carriers must follow in the preparation of the annual studies 
additionally  under current fcc rules governing rate making  surewest telephone is required to establish interstate rates based on projected demand usage for its various services and determine the actual earnings from these rates once actual volumes and costs are known 
in january  the fcc issued a memorandum opinion and order to another telephone company in which it clarified how internet traffic  which the fcc had prior to that date characterized as largely interstate in nature  should be treated 
during and  internet traffic and dsl service grew substantially  far exceeding surewest telephone s estimates  which resulted in actual earnings exceeding the levels allowed by the fcc 
based on preliminary cost studies  surewest telephone recognized liabilities relating to its estimated interstate shareable earnings obligations of  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  through reductions of revenues 
during the year ended december   surewest telephone made payments to certain telecommunications companies aggregating  related to interstate shareable earnings obligations for the monitoring period no similar payments were made in or on june   surewest telephone entered into a settlement agreement to recover  of the amount paid to a telecommunications company in the funds were received pursuant to the settlement agreement on july  surewest telephone is currently seeking a similar refund from another telecommunications company 
however  the recoverability of the remaining funds cannot presently be determined  as the telecommunications company from which surewest telephone is seeking a refund has filed for bankruptcy protection 
in may  the dc circuit court of appeals the court issued its decision in a case involving acs of anchorage 
the court determined that a tariff filed properly under section streamlined procedures and allowed to go into effect without suspension is deemed lawful  and the carrier is not subsequently obligated to pay refunds for earnings higher than the permitted rate of return as prescribed by the fcc for that monitoring period 
subsequent to the court s decision  certain telecommunication companies filed a petition for rehearing 
in august  the petitions for rehearing were denied by the court  and later that month the court s order became effective 
for the monitoring periods through  surewest telephone filed tariffs pursuant to the streamlined procedures and such tariffs were not suspended or investigated 
consequently  during the third quarter of  surewest telephone changed its estimate for a portion of its interstate shareable earnings obligations related to those monitoring periods 
for the year ended december  this change in accounting estimate increased the company s revenues by  and net income by  per share 
prior to january   surewest telephone billed sbc various charges for certain local service and network access service revenues in accordance with certain agreements as described below 
in  sbc expressed interest in withdrawing from the designated carrier plan dcp for surewest telephone s toll traffic 
the dcp was a compensation arrangement between surewest telephone and sbc for certain intrastate toll services 
surewest telephone and sbc agreed to allow the dcp arrangement to expire in december the termination of the dcp did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position as of december  and or results of operations for the years then ended 
in  sbc also expressed interest in entering into a new  permanent compensation arrangement for extended area service eas 
at that time  sbc had been paying surewest telephone approximately  per year for eas pursuant to a settlement transition agreement 
in november  the cpuc authorized sbc to terminate its annual eas payments to surewest telephone effective november  the cpuc authorized replacement funding to surewest telephone on an interim basis using funds from the chcf 
in addition  the cpuc opened an order instituting investigation oii for the purpose of determining whether future recovery of all  none  or a portion of the approximate  annual payments previously received from sbc should come from surewest telephone s ratepayers or other regulatory recovery mechanisms 
this proceeding began in  evidentiary hearings were held during  and briefing was completed in february in this proceeding  the office of ratepayer advocates ora recommended that the cpuc discontinue surewest telephone s present interim eas funding from the chcf without replacement revenues from ratepayers 
the cpuc s decision in this matter is expected during the cpuc has made no indication as to what  if any  changes will be forthcoming relating to eas revenues 
the results of these proceedings and their potential effects on surewest telephone cannot yet be determined 
in  the cpuc issued a decision in connection with surewest telephone s general rate proceeding  which authorized surewest telephone to implement a new regulatory framework nrf for services furnished within surewest telephone s service area in order to accommodate market and regulatory movement toward competition and greater pricing flexibility 
under the nrf  surewest telephone is subject to ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements  including a sharing mechanism whereby surewest telephone is required to share earnings with customers through a reduction of revenues if its earned annual rate of return exceeds that authorized by the cpuc 
in accordance with the requirements of its general rate case order  surewest telephone filed an application for review of its nrf in in connection with this proceeding  the cpuc s ora undertook a verification audit of surewest telephone s non regulated and affiliated transactions pursuant to the general rate case and other cpuc orders 
in june  the cpuc adopted its decision in this matter the decision 
the decision did not suspend the sharing mechanism as surewest telephone had requested and the cpuc ruled that surewest telephone must change the method used to allocate costs for services provided by surewest telephone to its affiliates  the treatment of certain directory revenues and the treatment of internal use software costs 
in accordance with the provisions of the decision  the company recorded liabilities and reduction of revenues of   and  relating to estimated intrastate shareable earnings obligations during the years ended december   and  respectively 
beginning in january  surewest telephone began paying a customer refund for intrastate shareable earnings obligations relating to the years and a portion of the customers intrastate service charges was returned in the form of a surcredit beginning in january and ending in january  totaling approximately  of which was returned during 
in october  the cpuc issued a resolution requiring surewest telephone to pay a refund for intrastate overearnings totaling approximately relating to a portion of the consumer s intrastate service charges are being returned to the customers in the form of a surcredit over approximately three months which began in november during the year ended december   was returned to customers 
as a result of periodic cost separation studies for the monitoring period  surewest telephone changed its estimates for a portion of its interstate and intrastate shareable earnings obligations and certain neca ccl accounts receivable balances during the years ended december  and for the year ended december   these changes in accounting estimates decreased telecom segment revenues by and net income by  respectively 
for the year ended december   similar changes in accounting estimates decreased telecom segment revenues by  and net income by as of december   the company s consolidated balance sheet reflected aggregate liabilities of  relating to surewest telephone s estimated interstate and intrastate shareable earnings obligations 
the calculations supporting these liabilities are very complex and involve a variety of estimates prior to the ultimate settlement of such obligations 
in addition  surewest telephone s interstate shareable earnings obligations lapse over time if surewest telephone s interexchange carrier and other customers do not claim the amounts ascribed to them 
accordingly  it is reasonably possible that management s estimates of the company s liabilities for interstate and intrastate shareable earnings obligations could change in the near term  and the amounts involved could be material 
significant business event in january  the company sold substantially all of the assets of its alarm monitoring division  which was a component of the telecom segment  for approximately  this sale resulted in a pre tax gain of  during through december   the company has received cash proceeds of  of which  and were received during and the fourth quarter of  respectively  related to the sale of the alarm monitoring division assets

critical accounting policies and estimates below is a summary of the company s critical accounting policies and estimates  which are more fully described in the referenced notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the company s audit committee 
o as discussed more fully in note  total revenues from telephone services are affected by rates authorized by various regulatory agencies 
the fcc monitors surewest telephone s interstate earnings through the use of annual cost separation studies prepared by surewest telephone  which utilize estimated cost information and projected demand usage 
the fcc establishes rules that carriers must follow in the preparation of the annual studies 
in addition  under nrf  surewest telephone is subject to ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements by the cpuc  including a sharing mechanism whereby surewest telephone may be required to share earnings with customers based on its earned annual rate of return 
the calculations supporting the liabilities associated with the company s estimated shareable earnings obligations are very complex and involve a variety of estimates prior to the ultimate settlement of such obligations 
accordingly  it is reasonably possible that management s estimates of surewest telephone s shareable earnings obligations could change in the near term  and the amounts involved could be material 
o as discussed more fully in note  the company recognizes revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement between the company and the customer exists  ii delivery of the product to the customer has occurred or service has been provided to the customer  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
o as discussed more fully in note  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
o as discussed more fully in note  the company states its inventories held for sale at lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventories  the company is required to make estimates regarding future customer demand 
o as discussed more fully in note  property  plant and equipment and intangible assets are recorded at cost 
retirements and other reductions of regulated telephone plant and equipment are charged against accumulated depreciation with no gain or loss recognized in accordance with the composite group remaining life methodology utilized for telephone plant assets 
when property applicable to non telephone operations is sold or retired  the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the associated gain or loss is recognized 
property  plant and equipment is depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives 
the economic lives are estimated at the time the assets are acquired and are based on historical experience with similar assets  as well as anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or differently than anticipated  the economic lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
likewise  if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than anticipated  the life of the asset group could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to the group 
this could result in a reduction of depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
the company reviews these types of assets annually  or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  which consist principally of wireless spectrum licenses and goodwill  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges relating to its intangible assets 
o as discussed more fully in notes and  the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the company does not have a valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset as of december  or because it believes it is more likely than not that such deferred tax asset will be realized 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which the determination was made 
however  the company believes it will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset of  as of december  o as discussed more fully in note  the company has pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations 
the company s pension and post retirement benefit obligations are actuarially determined based on estimates of discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets and increases in future compensation levels 
changes in these estimates and other factors could significantly impact the company s pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans 
a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects percentage percentage point increase point decrease effect on total service and interest cost effect on post retirement benefit obligation as of december  the discount rate is determined based on the current yields on high quality corporate fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations 
as of december   the company reduced the discount rate by basis points to 
this change in the discount rate did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations 
in  the company used an expected long term rate of return of 
for  the company does not believe the expected long term rate will change significantly 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the current and projected investment portfolio mix and estimated long term investment returns for each asset class 
the projected portfolio mix of the plan assets is developed in consideration of the expected duration of related plan obligations and private equity positions 
the expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the expected long term rate of return to the market value of plan assets 
the future compensation levels are based on recent experience as well as future expectations 
as of december   the company reduced the future compensation level by basis points to and it remains at that level 
this change in the future compensation level did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations 
o as discussed more fully in notes and  the company is a party to a variety of litigation  regulatory proceedings and other contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses for certain of these matters 
the determination of the liabilities required  if any  for loss contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate outcome of these matters will not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
o the company currently sponsors two equity incentive plans the plans for certain employees  outside directors and consultants of the company  which were approved by the company s shareholders 
the plans permit issuance by the company of awards in the form of restricted shares  stock units  performance shares  stock options and stock appreciation rights 
prior to  the company accounted for those plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based compensation expense for stock options was reflected in net income for the years ended december  and  as all stock options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   the company adopted the preferable fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under the prospective transition method selected by the company  as described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  compensation expense was recognized in for all employee awards granted  modified or settled after january  this change in accounting for stock based compensation resulted in increased compensation expense of  which decreased net income by no effect on earnings per share for the year ended december  the company voluntarily made the choice to change to the preferable method of accounting for employee stock options in accordance with sfas no 
the company concluded that stock options are a form of employee compensation expense and  therefore  it is appropriate that these expenses be recorded in the results of operations to more clearly reflect economic reality 
the black scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected lives and risk free interest rates 
these assumptions reflect management s best estimates  but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the control of the company 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used in the current period  stock based compensation expense could have been materially different 
if management uses different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years

 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are required to be divided into separate units of accounting under certain circumstances 
the company adopted eitf issue no 
on a prospective basis for arrangements entered into after june  the company has determined that the sale of its wireless handsets and the associated phone service provided by the wireless segment should be considered separate units of accounting under eitf issue no 
accordingly  beginning on july   the company began applying eitf issue no 
to all wireless handset sales below cost  which approximates fair value in the absence of an activation subsidy  when it receives an up front fee of any kind eg  a service activation fee 
the application of eitf issue no 
resulted in the immediate recognition of all or a portion of such up front fees as equipment sales revenue 
additionally  when the company activates wireless service for a customer  but does not concurrently provide the customer with a handset  any up front fees received continue to be deferred and amortized over the expected term of the customer relationship 
the company provides a general right of return within the first days of service for a refund of the handset cost

 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  sfas no 
addresses accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill is not amortized but instead evaluated at least annually for impairment in a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
the company has determined that the reporting units are equal to its reportable business segments since the business units within the reportable segments have similar economic characteristics 
goodwill was allocated to the reporting unit that received economic benefit from the acquisition 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the forecast and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference the company believes its wireless spectrum licenses have indefinite lives because such licenses can be renewed indefinitely at little cost 
accordingly  the company has applied the nonamortization provision of sfas no 
to the company s wireless spectrum licenses effective january   which resulted in an increase in the company s consolidated net income of per share for the years ended december  and the company s operating results for the year ended december  included of amortization expense related to the company s wireless spectrum licenses 
in the absence of such amortization  the company s adjusted net income for the year ended december  would have been  per share 
beginning in the first quarter of  the company s wireless spectrum licenses are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  which is evaluated at least annually and determined based on transactions involving sales of comparable wireless spectrum licenses in the aftermarket or independent valuations 
the goodwill recognized by the company in connection with the acquisition of surewest custom data services in july has been allocated to the telecom segment and is not being amortized based on the provisions of sfas no s 
and the company tests for impairment annually during the fourth quarter 
the company completed its annual impairment tests during the fourth quarters of and and did not identify any impairment of its goodwill or wireless spectrum licenses 
on january   the company adopted the provision of eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  dealing with consideration from a vendor to a reseller under cooperative advertising and other arrangements 
this provision of eitf issue no 
states that consideration from a vendor to a reseler of the vendor s products or services is presumed to be a reduction of the selling price of the vendor s products or services  unless the vendor i receives an identifiable benefit in return for the consideration and ii can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
if the amount of consideration paid by the vendor exceeds the estimated fair value of the benefit received  the excess amount is to be recorded by the vendor as a reduction of revenues 
the application of this new guidance did not have a material effect on the company s and consolidated financial statements 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
factors that could affect future results as a result of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not necessarily be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
representative examples of these factors include without limitation the following we expect to continue to face significant competition in all parts of our business and the level of competition is expected to intensify 
the telecommunications industry is highly competitive 
we face actual or potential competition from many existing and emerging companies  including other incumbent and competitive local telephone companies  long distance carriers and resellers  wireless telephone companies  internet service providers  satellite companies and cable television companies 
we may not be able to successfully anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including regulatory changes that may affect our competitors and us differently  new technologies and services that may be introduced  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends and discount pricing strategies by competitors 
as the incumbent carrier in sacramento  sbc communications enjoys certain business advantages  including its size  financial resources  favorable regulatory position  brand recognition and connection to virtually all of our customers and potential customers there 
as the largest cable operator in sacramento and placer county  comcast enjoys certain business advantages  including its size  financial resources  ownership or superior access to programming and other content  brand recognition  and first in the field advantages with a customer base that generates positive cash flow for its operations 
we face intense competition in our markets for long distance  internet access and other ancillary services that are important to our business and to our growth strategy 
we must adapt to rapid technological change 
technological developments could increase our costs and cause a decline in demand for our services 
in addition  technology changes can give competitors significant new advantages 
if we do not replace or upgrade technology and equipment that becomes obsolete  we will be unable to compete effectively because we will not be able to meet the needs or expectations of our customers 
additionally  replacing or upgrading our infrastructure in the future could result in significant capital expenditures 
we are subject to a complex and uncertain regulatory environment 
some parts of our business are extensively regulated  and the nature of regulation continues to undergo fundamental change and reinterpretation 
our operations have undergone material changes  and our actual operating results can be expected to differ from the results indicated in our historical financial statements 
as a result of our acquisition of assets from win in  our mix of operating assets differs from those operations upon which our historical financial statements are based 
consequently  our historical financial statements may not be reliable as an indicator of future results 
our success depends upon our ability to manage our growth and expansion 
if our acquisitions and growth initiatives are not successful  we could suffer an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our growth strategy will require us to invest significant capital in services that may not achieve the desired returns 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to manage our growth  including our ability to build network and related facilities to serve new customers  integrate our operations to take advantage of new capabilities and systems  attract and retain skilled personnel across the company  effectively manage the demands of day to day operations in new areas while attempting to execute our business strategy  and realize the projected growth and revenue targets developed by company management 
we have more indebtedness now than at december  in march  the company completed a note purchase agreement for the issuance of its unsecured series b senior notes series b notes in the aggregate principal amount of  the series b notes have a final maturity of ten years and an average life of eight years 
interest is payable semi annually at a fixed rate of 
principal payments are due in equal annual installments of  commencing in march and ending in march the company used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the series b notes to retire certain short term borrowings  which had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of  a substantial intended use of the series b notes proceeds was and continues to be the funding of capital expenditures for the company s surewest broadband residential services business 
we are reliant on support funds provided under federal and state laws 
we receive revenues from various federal or state support funds long term support from the universal service program  chcf b and universal lifeline service fund 
these governmental programs are reviewed and amended from time to time  and are likely to change in the near future 
the outcome and impact on the company s operations resulting from future changes to these governmental programs cannot be determined at this time 
we could be harmed by the recent adverse developments affecting other communications companies 
there have been numerous bankruptcies and other financial difficulties experienced by other carriers and suppliers in the telecommunications and internet sectors 
similar situations with our suppliers  some of whom provide products and services for which there are few substitutes  could cause us to experience delays  service interruptions or additional expenses 
we depend on third parties  over whom we have no control  to deliver our services 
because of the interconnected nature of the telecommunications industry  we depend heavily on other local telephone companies  long distance carriers  and numerous other third parties to deliver our services 
in addition  we are dependent on easements  franchises and licenses from various private parties such as established telephone companies and other utilities  railroads  long distance companies  state highway authorities  local governments and transit authorities for access to aerial pole space  underground conduits and other rights of way in order to construct and operate our networks 
the failure to maintain in effect the necessary third party arrangements on acceptable terms would have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business 
if we are unable to effectively and efficiently implement the necessary initiatives to eliminate the material weaknesses identified in our internal controls and procedures  there could be an adverse affect on our operations or financial results 
our auditors  ernst young llp  in connection with the audit of the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   advised us that they had concluded that material weaknesses in the company s internal control existed  including with respect to issues identified as a result of the special investigation instituted by the audit committee 
the specific matters identified by ernst young llp encompassed i control of cash and investments  ii accounting personnel  policies and procedures and iii accounting for property  plant and equipment 
we performed substantial additional procedures designed to ensure that the internal control deficiencies did not lead to material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements 
we have already implemented various initiatives  and are considering additional initiatives to improve our internal controls  and address the matters identified by ernst young llp 
the implementation of the initiatives and the consideration of additional necessary improvements are among our highest priorities 
the board of directors  under the direction of the audit committee  will continually assess the progress of the initiatives and the improvements  and take further actions as deemed necessary 
until all of the identified material weaknesses are eliminated  there is a risk of an adverse affect on our operations or financial results 
in addition  we anticipate that the initiatives will require the hiring of additional employees and the incurrence of fees and expenses of third parties necessary to improve the internal controls  likely resulting in increased operating expenses 
regulatory and legal matters surewest telephone is subject to regulation by the fcc and cpuc 
in the past  there have been various proceedings before these agencies to which surewest telephone has been a party 
in  congress passed the telecommunications act of the act  which significantly changed the regulatory environment for telecommunications companies 
beginning in  the fcc conducted proceedings and adopted orders implementing the act s provisions to open local exchange service markets  such as the market of surewest telephone  to competition 
these proceedings and orders address interconnection  access charges and universal service 
with respect to local competition  the fcc rules outline pricing methodologies for the states to follow when setting rates for incumbent carriers such as surewest telephone to charge competitors for resale  interconnection and unbundled network elements 
given the act s relatively recent enactment  the ongoing actions taken by the fcc to promulgate rules and regulations on interconnection access charges and universal service reform  and the various on going legal challenges considering the validity of these fcc orders  it is not yet possible to determine fully the impact of the act and related fcc regulations on surewest telephone s operations 
the company s financial condition and results of operations have been and will be affected by recent and future proceedings before the cpuc and fcc 
pending before the fcc and cpuc are proceedings which are considering o additional rules governing the opening of markets to competition  o the goals and definition of universal telephone service in a changing environment  including examination of subsidy support mechanisms for subscribers of different carriers including incumbent carriers and in various geographic areas  o rules that will provide non discriminatory access by competing service providers to the network capabilities of local exchange carriers and o the regulated rates and earnings of surewest telephone 
there are a number of pending and anticipated other regulatory proceedings occurring at the federal and state levels that may have a material impact on surewest telephone 
these regulatory proceedings include  but are not limited to  consideration of changes to the interstate universal service fund  intercarrier compensation including access charges reform and the regulation of local exchange carriers  and regulation of ip enabled services 
the outcomes and impact on surewest telephone s operations of these proceedings and related court matters cannot be determined at this time 
the eventual impact on the company of the effect of all the proceedings described above cannot presently be determined
