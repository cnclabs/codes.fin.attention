item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we own and operate full service  casual dining restaurants 
as of december   we operated restaurants 
in addition to these units  there were several limited menu restaurants and other properties and two restaurants that were closed temporarily for renovation 
in february  we acquired seafood restaurants located primarily in michigan and florida in connection with the acquisition of ca muer  inc  the muer acquisition 
in august  we purchased chart house seafood restaurants  located primarily on the east and west coasts of the united states 
these acquisitions included plans for the redevelopment of ten additional lower profitability restaurants  which were also then acquired  into joe s crab shack restaurants  and the sale or disposal of approximately six additional acquired  but non strategic locations 
in october  we purchased texas based saltgrass steak house restaurants 
the restaurant industry is intensely competitive and is affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national  regional  and local economic conditions and demographic trends 
the performance of individual restaurants may be affected by factors such as traffic patterns  demographic considerations  marketing  weather conditions  and the type  number  and location of competing restaurants 
we have many well established competitors with greater financial resources  larger marketing and advertising budgets  and longer histories of operation than ours  including competitors already established in regions where we are planning to expand  as well as competitors planning to expand in the same regions 
we face significant competition from mid priced  full service  casual dining restaurants offering or promoting seafood and other types and varieties of cuisine 
our competitors include national  regional  and local chains as well as local owner operated restaurants 
we also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for restaurant sites 
we intend to pursue an acquisition strategy 
in this report  we have made forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainty  including without limitation  our ability to continue our expansion strategy  our ability to

liquidity and capital resources during the year  the company increased its total borrowing capacity to million through the closing of two separate financing agreements  which allow for increased financing permitted under the existing agreements 
the terms of these agreements are outlined below 
with the financing we intend to continue our planned growth 
we plan to fund capital expenditures and any additional restaurant or business acquisitions out of proceeds from existing cash balances  tax refunds aggregating million  cash flow from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities 
we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures in  on opening approximately restaurants  refurbishments of existing restaurants and other projects 
as a result of our tax loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets  including amounts attributable to the acquisition of rainforest cafe  we expect our cash flow from operations to be subject to reduced federal income tax payments for the foreseeable future  which will therefore provide additional cash flow for funding our business activities and debt service 
as of january   the company had approximately million available under the existing credit facilities for expansion and working capital purposes 
in october  the company refinanced its bank credit facility by issuing long term notes totaling million through a private placement of debt the senior notes and amending and extending the existing bank credit facility to a four year million revolving credit facility the bank credit facility 
the senior notes mature in october through october  and the bank credit facility matures in october interest on the senior notes is paid quarterly at an average rate of 
interest on the bank credit facility is payable monthly or quarterly at libor or the bank s base rate plus a financing spread 
the company s financing spread under the bank credit facility is presently for libor borrowings 
the senior notes and bank credit facility are secured by stock of subsidiaries  and governed by certain financial covenants  including maximum leverage ratio  maximum indebtedness  net worth  and fixed charge ratio tests 
the bank 
table of contents credit facility additionally provides for limitations on annual capital expenditures to prescribed amounts  maximum annual cash dividends and limitations on repurchases of common stock 
the bank credit facility also provides the ability to add an additional million of capacity within the facility and other permitted indebtedness 
a wholly owned subsidiary of ours assumed an million non recourse  long term note payable due may in connection with an asset purchase in march principal and interest payments under this note aggregate  monthly 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased million of common stock 
in september  the company authorized an open market stock repurchase program for million 
the company expects to make opportunistic repurchases of its common stock 
as of december   the company had contractual obligations as described below 
these obligations are expected to be funded primarily through cash flow from operations  working capital and additional financing sources in the normal course of business operations 
contractual obligations in thousands less than year years years after years operating leases long term debt unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total cash obligations other commercial commitments in thousands less than year years years after years line of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments from time to time  we review opportunities for restaurant acquisitions and investments in the hospitality  entertainment  amusement  food service and facilities management and other industries 
our exercise of any such investment opportunity may impact our development plans and capital expenditures 
we believe that adequate sources of capital are available to fund our business activities through december  as a primary result of establishing long term borrowings  the company will incur higher interest expense in the future 
however  the company has mitigated a portion of the higher immediate interest expense by entering into two fair value hedges aggregating notional amounts of million  whereby the company swapped higher fixed interest rates of the senior notes for floating interest rates equal to three month libor plus 
since april  we have paid an annual per share dividend  declared and paid in quarterly amounts 
the company is currently reviewing its dividend policy to determine if the annual per share dividend will be increased in seasonality and quarterly results our business is seasonal in nature 
our reduced winter volumes cause revenues and  to a greater degree  operating profits to be lower in the first and fourth quarters than in other quarters 
we have and continue to open restaurants in highly seasonal tourist markets 
joe s crab shack restaurants tend to experience even greater seasonality and sensitivity to weather than our other restaurant concepts 
periodically  our sales and profitability may be negatively affected by adverse weather 
the timing of unit openings can and will affect quarterly results 

table of contents critical accounting policies restaurant and other properties are reviewed on a property by property basis for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
the recoverability of properties that are to be held and used is measured by comparison of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the carrying amount of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
properties to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value  reduced for estimated disposal costs  and are included in other current assets 
we follow the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  and as such do not record compensation expense related to amounts outstanding 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities in january this interpretation provides guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  variable interest entities 
variable interest entities are entities that lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or lack sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if that company is obligated to absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses or entitled to receive the majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
the company does not believe that fin will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the fasb issued sfas no

provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no

sfas no 
is effective for interim periods beginning after june  the company s adoption of sfas no 
did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our operations during the past several years 
we believe we have historically been able to pass on increased costs through menu price increases  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
future increases in restaurant labor costs  including expected future increases in federal minimum wages  land and construction costs could adversely affect our profitability and ability to expand 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks including risks related to potential adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we actively monitor exposure to market risk and continue to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in commodity prices 
interest rate risk total debt at december   included million of floating rate debt attributed to bank borrowings and million of floating rate debt under interest rate swap agreements at an average interest rate of 
the floating rate debt was refinanced in october by a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
as a result  our annual interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates and will increase as a result of the refinancing of our obligations on a long term fixed rate basis 
in connection with the senior notes  the company entered into two interest swap agreements with the objective of reducing our exposure to interest rate risk and lowering interest expense 
the agreements were effective beginning october  and mature in six years and seven years for an aggregate notional amount of million 
the impact on annual cash flow of a ten percent change in the floating rate approximately would be approximately million annually based on the floating rate debt and other obligations outstanding at december   however  there are no assurances that possible rate changes would be limited to such amounts
