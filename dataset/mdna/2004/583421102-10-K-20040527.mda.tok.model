item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors 
overview we are a designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensor based consumer products 
we produce a wide variety of sensors that use advanced technologies to measure precise ranges of physical characteristics including pressure  motion  force  displacement  tilt angle  flow and distance 
we have two businesses  a sensor business and a consumer products business 
our sensor segment designs and manufactures sensors for original equipment manufacturers 
these sensors are used for automotive  medical  consumer  military aerospace and industrial applications 
our sensor products include piezoresistive pressure sensors  transducers and transmitters  electromagnetic displacement sensors  piezoelectric polymer film sensors  tilt sensors  membrane switch panel sensors  custom microstructures  load cells and accelerometers 
our consumer products segment designs and manufactures sensor based consumer products 
our sensor based consumer bath and kitchen scale products are now sold and marketed primarily under the brand names of our original equipment manufacturer customers  previously they were also sold directly to retailers 
our tire pressure gauges and distance measurement products are sold and marketed under our own brand names  as well as those of our oem and private label customers 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended march  net sales sensors consumer products total net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses income selling  general  and administrative litigation expense research and development customer funded development non cash equity based compensation goodwill and other impairments restructuring costs interest expense  net other expenses income income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change income tax benefit expense loss from operations of discontinued units gain on disposition of discontinued units cumulative effect of accounting change net income loss our development growth strategy development strategy 
we are focusing our development efforts in both our sensor business and consumer products business on the original equipment manufacturers oem market 
in the consumer products business  having both a branded and oem consumer scale business has historically created channel conflicts 
as part of our effort to focus on the oem market  we sold certain assets associated with our thinner branded bathroom and kitchen scale business to conair corporation on january  we previously sold our thinner branded scales directly to retailers  predominately in the us and canada 
on a going forward basis  we expect to supply these scales directly to conair and intend to continue our efforts in the design  development and manufacture of innovative scale products for sale to our worldwide base of oem customers 
as oem margins have historically been lower than margins on sales to retail customers  we expect our consumer products segment margins will decline as a result of this transaction 
although our development focus is on the oem market  we intend to continue to develop and manufacture our tire pressure gauges  which are sold directly to retail customers 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for a more detailed description of the conair transaction 
growth strategy 
we are focused on aggressively growing our sensor segment 
we expect that this growth will come through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions of sensor businesses 
in order to finance any potential acquisitions  we would consider using available cash  loans from financial institutions  the sale of equity securities  or the sale of existing company assets  including assets in our consumer products segment 
trends 
sensor business the sensors market is highly fragmented with hundreds of niche players 
while the worldwide sensors market that we serve is expected to have a compound annual growth rate cagr  we expect to gain share and grow our sensor business in excess of the market 
consumer products business as a result of the conair transaction  we are now solely an oem manufacturer of bath and kitchen scales 
as oem margins historically have been lower than retail margins  including the effect of the amortized gain related to the conair transaction see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we anticipate gross margins in the consumer products business to be in the range for the fiscal year ending march  changes in our business discontinued operations in september  we sold all of the outstanding stock of terraillon holdings limited referred to herein as terraillon  a european manufacturer of branded consumer bathroom and kitchen scales  to fukuda luxembourg sarl  an investment holding company incorporated in luxembourg 
we placed our united kingdom subsidiary  measurement specialties uk limited referred to herein as schaevitz uk  into receivership on june  pursuant to the terms of a mortgage debenture dated february  our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended march    and include the results of our ongoing operations 
as a result of placing schaevitz uk into receivership and selling terraillon  these entities have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial results for all periods presented 
accordingly  all comparisons in management s discussion and analysis for each of the fiscal years ended march   and exclude the results of these discontinued operations except for loss from discontinued units  cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax  and net income loss 
sale of assets on january   conair corporation purchased certain assets of our thinner branded bathroom and kitchen scale business  and now owns worldwide rights to the thinner brand name and exclusive rights to the thinner designs in north america 
we previously sold our thinner branded scales directly to retailers  predominately in the us and canada 
on a going forward basis  we expect to supply these scales directly to conair and intend to continue our efforts in the design  development and manufacture of innovative scale products for sale to our worldwide base of oem customers in july  we sold the assets  principally property and equipment  related to our silicon wafer fab manufacturing operation in milpitas  ca to silicon microstructures  inc smi  a wholly owned subsidiary of elmos semiconductor ag 
the wafer fab operation was formerly part of our ic sensors division 
ic sensors continues to design and sell all  and manufacture most  of the product lines it produced prior to the sale  including custom wafers and die  pressure sensors  accelerometers and custom mems components  and to outsource to smi the manufacturing of silicon chips used in these products 
this sale is reflected in the results of operations of the sensors segment 
executive summary measurement specialties has seen a significant amount of change over the last several years 
there were considerable challenges encountered in integrating the acquisition of the piezo polymer division of amp acquired in august  the ic sensor division of perkin elmer acquired in february   and the schaevitz division of trw acquired in august into the sensors business 
as a result  we experienced very poor historical margin performance due mainly to under absorption of the acquired overhead structure 
in may  we embarked upon an aggressive restructuring effort to improve the operating performance of the company 
a key component of this restructuring was the elimination of underutilized facilities to consolidate our operations in shenzhen  china and hampton  virginia 
having completed this restructuring  measurement specialties is now a global sensor solutions company with a broad range of technologies and capabilities 
our focus is engineered solutions where we can use our engineering and manufacturing talent and depth of knowledge and experience in sensors to provide a complete solution to our customers 
a key to our manufacturing strategy is leveraging the significant infrastructure we now have in shenzhen  china 
as more fully described below  this infrastructure has enabled us to reduce costs and improve financial performance while continuing to provide our customers with low cost  highly reliable products 
new accounting standards on may   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas  which requires that certain financial instruments be presented as liabilities that were previously presented as equity or as temporary equity 
such instruments include mandatory redeemable preferred and common stock  and certain options and warrants 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and is generally effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we do not believe that this statement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  and amended april  fin r consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  for certain entities that do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of fin r will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
fin r applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company is in the process of determining what impact  if any  the adoption of the provisions of fin r will have upon its financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not believe that the adoption of fin r will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus opinion on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus provides that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement should be allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with different provisions if the fair value of all deliverables are not known or if the fair value is contingent on delivery of specified items or performance conditions 
applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each separate unit of accounting 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  entities may elect to report the change as a cumulative effect adjustment in accordance with apb opinion  accounting changes 
on january   conair corporation purchased certain assets of our thinner branded bathroom and kitchen scale business  and now owns worldwide rights to the thinner brand name and exclusive rights to the thinner designs in north america 
we have accounted for the sale of this business under the guidance of eitf see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for a discussion of the sale of the sale of the business to conair 
except for the conair transaction  we do not believe that the adoption of eitf will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
revenue recognition revenue is recorded when products are shipped  at which time title generally passes to the customer 
certain consumer products may be sold with a provision allowing the customer to return a portion of products 
upon shipment  we provide for allowances for returns based upon historical and estimated return rates 
the amount of actual returns could differ from our estimate 
changes in estimated returns would be accounted for in the period of change 
we utilize manufacturing representatives as sales agents for certain of our products 
such representatives do not receive orders directly from customers  take title to or physical possession of products  or invoice customers 
accordingly  revenue is recognized upon shipment to the customer 
certain consumer products are sold under private label arrangements with various distributors 
such products are manufactured to the distributor s specifications 
we are not responsible for the ultimate sale to third party customers and therefore record revenue upon shipment to the distributor 
on january   conair corporation purchased certain assets of our thinner branded bathroom and kitchen scale business  and now owns worldwide rights to the thinner brand name and exclusive rights to the thinner designs in north america 
we have accounted for the sale of this business under the guidance of eitf as a significant portion of the proceeds from the sale was in fact an up front payment for future lost margins  the majority of the gain on sale has been deferred and will be amortized into revenues in future periods over the estimated remaining lives for those products sold to conair 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for a discussion of the sale of the business to conair 
accounts receivable the majority of our accounts receivable are due from manufacturers of electronic  automotive  military  industrial products and retailers 
credit is extended based on evaluation of a customer s financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are generally due within to days and are stated as amounts due from customers net of allowances for doubtful accounts  and other sales allowances 
accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
we determine our allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  our previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to us  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
we write off accounts receivable when we determine they are uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
actual uncollectible accounts could exceed our estimates and changes to our estimates will be accounted for in the period of change 
inventories we make purchasing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers  the availability and pricing of raw materials and projected customer requirements 
future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to our operations include slowdown in customer demand  customer delay in the issuance of sales orders  miscalculation of customer requirements  technology changes that render raw materials and finished goods obsolete  loss of customers and or cancellation of sales orders 
we establish reserves for our inventories to recognize estimated obsolescence and unusable items on a continual basis 
market conditions surrounding products are also considered periodically to determine if there are any net realizable valuation matters  which would require a write down of any related inventories 
if market or technological conditions change  it may result in additional inventory reserves and write downs  which would be accounted for in the period of change 
goodwill impairment management assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or more frequently under certain circumstances 
such circumstances include i significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iii unanticipated competition  iv a loss of key personnel  v a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of  and vi recognition of an impairment loss in a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 
management must make assumptions regarding estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
impairment charges would be included in general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the goodwill 
long lived assets management assesses the recoverability of long lived assets  which consist primarily of fixed assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant negative industry or economic trends  iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and iv a change in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above mentioned factors  an impairment analysis is performed using a projected discounted cash flow method 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
impairment charges would be included in general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the related assets on our balance sheets 
income taxes we file income tax returns in every jurisdiction in which we have reason to believe that we are subject to tax 
historically  we have been subject to examination by various taxing jurisdictions 
to date  none of these examinations has resulted in any material additional tax 
nonetheless  any tax jurisdiction may contend that our filing position regarding one or more of our transactions is contrary to that jurisdiction s laws or regulations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent on generating future taxable income 
during the fiscal year ended march   we provided a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets since we believed at the time that enough uncertainty existed regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
however  because of the current and expected future results of the company  taking into account the current status of our litigation see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for a discussion of our pending litigation  we have concluded that this valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is no longer necessary  and have reversed the allowance against the provision for taxes in the fiscal year ended march  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for a further discussion of our taxes 
the income tax provision is based upon the proportion of pretax profit in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
the income tax rates in hong kong and china are less than those in the united states 
deferred income taxes are not provided on our subsidiaries earnings which are expected to be reinvested 
distribution  in the form of dividends or otherwise  would subject our subsidiaries earnings to united states income taxes  subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred united states income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation 
warranty reserve our sensor and consumer products generally are marketed under warranties to end users of up to ten years 
factors affecting our warranty liability include the number of products sold and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim 
we provide for estimated product warranty obligations at the time of sale  based on our historical warranty claims experience and assumptions about future warranty claims 
this estimate is susceptible to changes in the near term based on introductions of new products  product quality improvements declines and changes in end user application and or behavior 
contingencies and litigation we periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimates that we may have made with respect to their resolution

net sales 
sensor business 
the increase in net sales of our sensor business during the fiscal year ended march  is due to increased ic sensors and microfused product line sales as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 
the improved ics ics product line sales is the result of increased demand from existing and new customers in the medical field  the introduction of a new line of instrumentation grade pressure transducers  as well as increased sales in the european and asian markets 
the improved microfused product line sales are primarily due to continued growth in demand in the automotive sector due to the introduction of new customer platforms  and a general increase in demand for our microfused products 
the microfused product line sales increased across multiple markets including medical  industrial  refrigeration  and flow measurement 
piezo sales declined due to the loss of a large customer 
schaevitz sales increased by 
consumer products business 
the decrease in net sales of our consumer products business in the fiscal year ended march  is primarily attributable to lower bath scale and kitchen accessory sales  which were slightly offset by an increase in tire gauge sales in the us bath scale sales decreased due to the conair transaction  as conair made virtually no purchases in the month of february as they assessed the inventory that was acquired as part of the transaction 
in addition  net sales will decline for the portion of the scale business that was sold to conair because we are no longer selling at retail sales prices  which are higher than sales prices to oem customers 
kitchen accessory sales decreased during the quarter ended march  compared to the prior year due to underperformance in this product category 
accordingly  we have decided to discontinue selling kitchen accessories 
tire gauge sales improved in the us consumer market due to increases in core business with our major customers 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percent of sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased to from for the fiscal year ended march  sensor business 
gross margin as a percent of sales for our sensor business increased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the continued margin improvement in the sensor business is primarily due to more efficient manufacturing operations and decreased material costs  as more raw materials are purchased in asia 
our increased operations efficiency over the prior year was the direct result of our continued focus on production planning and implementation of our restructuring plan 
freight costs have continued to fall as a percentage of sales through more effective management of the freight costs 
consumer products business 
gross margin as a percent of sales in our consumer products business increased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in gross margin for our consumer products business in the fiscal year ended march  is primarily due to improved margins on our sales to original equipment manufacturers 
the margins on sales to original equipment manufacturers improved as a result of improved product mix  lower freight costs and a reduction in material costs due to our concentration on the more efficient use of raw materials in the manufacturing process 
the margin on our retail customer sales increased slightly for the period ended march  as compared to the same period ended march  this increase was mainly due to lower freight and material costs  offset slightly by lower margins for the kitchen accessories product category 
we have decided to no longer sell kitchen accessories and liquidated much of the remaining inventory in the fiscal year ended march  at margins below historical levels 
on a continuing basis our gross margin in the sensor and consumer products businesses may vary due to product mix  sales volume  availability of raw materials and other factors 
selling  general and administrative 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to lower legal and professional fees incurred during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the same period in prior fiscal year 
these legal and professional fees decreased approximately  in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  the higher professional fees in the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period were due to a higher level of professional activity with respect to the restatement of our financial statements and the class action lawsuit and sec investigation 
in addition  costs have decreased in the sensor business due to consolidation of certain support services 
offsetting these declines is an overall charge of  in the fiscal year ended march  for employee bonus payouts and the employer s match against the employee contributions to the k plan as a result of the improvement in company performance 
our employee bonus and k plan is variable and is funded based upon performance against budget 
costs in the fiscal year ended march  decreased due to a refund of property taxes and a reduction in bonus accruals  as there were no incentive based bonuses paid in that year 
based upon our current budget for the fiscal year ended march   we would expect to fund approximately  for the employee bonus and k match in fiscal litigation expense 
we recorded a net charge of  during the fiscal year ended march  relating to the sec investigation  class action lawsuit  and the hibernia capital partners litigation 
this net charge represents the combination of a  charge relating to the sec investigation  an additional  charge relating to the class action lawsuit  offset by the reversal of from the prior accrual upon the favorable settlement of the hibernia lawsuit 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
non cash equity based compensation 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a non cash equity based compensation charge of  or 
per share diluted  for the vesting of the warrant issued to four corners capital partners lp  a limited partnership of which mr 
guidone is a principal 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
there will be no additional charges resulting from these warrants issued to four corners as all the warrants vested in the fiscal year ended march research and development we had virtually no customer funded development for the fiscal year ended march  compared with for the fiscal year ended march  on a net basis  research and development costs increased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended march  from  for the fiscal year ended march  this change resulted from decreased customer funded development which was partially offset by decreased research and development efforts in our sensor business 
restructuring costs 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a charge of for additional costs relating to our restructuring plan 
this charge resulted from the settlement of litigation related to our former facility in valley forge  pennsylvania 
interest expense  net 
the decrease in interest expense is attributable to a  reduction in average debt outstanding from  for the fiscal year ended march  to  for the fiscal year ended march  income taxes 
our provision for income taxes includes taxes payable by our foreign subsidiaries 
for us tax purposes  we anticipate that our available net operating loss carry forwards will offset all current fiscal year taxable income 
during the fiscal year ended march   we provided a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets since we believed at the time that enough uncertainty existed regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
however  because of the current and expected future results of the company  taking into account the status of our current litigation  the company has concluded that this valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is no longer necessary  and has accordingly reversed the allowance against the provision for taxes in the fiscal year ended march  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for a further discussion on taxes 
discontinued operations 
the income from discontinued operations in the fiscal year ended march  reflects additional proceeds from the receiver associated with the schaevitz uk liquidation

sensor business 
sensor business 
the increase in net sales of our sensor business for the fiscal year ended march  was primarily the result of strong sales in our microfused pressure product line  with increased demand across our expanding oem customer base and increased sales in the automotive sector due to the introduction of new customer platforms 
consumer products business 
approximately of the sales improvement in our consumer products business for the fiscal year ended march  resulted from the liquidation of  of slow moving and obsolete inventory during that period 
excluding this liquidation of inventory  consumer products sales increased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  the balance of the improved sales was mainly attributable to increased sales of bath scales and tire pressure gauges 
in addition  sales increased due to the introduction of our kitchen accessories line 
oem sales were consistent year over year 
gross margin gross margin as a percent of sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased to from for the fiscal year ended march  sensor business 
gross margin as a percent of sales for our sensor business increased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the significant improvement of our sensors margin was primarily due to the transfer of production and materials sourcing to our lower cost china facility from our facilities located in milpitas  ca  hampton va  and valley forge  pa 
as a result of the sale and closure of the milpitas  ca wafer fab and valley forge  pa facility  we were able to transfer production to a lower cost manufacturing environment in china and to eliminate significant fixed costs associated with these two facilities 
offsetting some of this margin improvement in the fiscal year ended march  was the negative margin impact associated with the write down of inventory 
during the fiscal year ended march   we produced certain custom products for one of our customers  stayhealthy inc in the fiscal year ended march   we concluded that collectability for certain of the products manufactured for stayhealthy could not be reasonably assured 
accordingly  gross margin was negatively affected due to the write down of inventory related to the products manufactured for stayhealthy 
consumer products business 
gross margin as a percent of sales for our consumer products business increased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  consumer products gross margins for the fiscal year ended march  reflect  in write downs of slow moving and obsolete inventory to net realizable value 
these write downs were largely comprised of park zone inventory 
on a continuing basis our gross margin in the sensor and consumer products businesses may vary due to product mix  sales volume  availability of raw materials and other factors 
selling  general and administrative 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to savings in payroll  facility and other expenses resulting from our cost reduction activities in the fiscal year ended march   largely offset by increased legal and professional fees incurred during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 
these legal and professional fees increased approximately  in the fiscal year ended march  over the prior fiscal year 
the reasons for the increased legal fees are described in the fiscal year to fiscal year comparison of selling  general and administrative expenses above 
in addition  the increases were offset by a reduction in bad debt provisions and a refund of property taxes 
litigation expense 
the net charge of  relates to  accrual for the class action lawsuit and accrual for the hibernia capital partners research and development 
we had of customer funded development for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  of customer funded development for the fiscal year ended march  on a net basis  research and development costs decreased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended march  from  for the fiscal year ended march  the primary cause of the reduction in customer funded development was the sale of the ic sensors wafer fab in july restructuring costs 
the restructuring charges of  and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively relate to severance and lease costs relating to reductions in our workforce and consolidation of operations 
interest expense  net 
the decrease in interest expense is attributable to a  reduction in average debt outstanding from  in the fiscal year ended march  to  in the fiscal year ended march  interest expense includes associated with the issuance of the warrants in connection with the  bridge loan from castletop capital  lp  a limited partnership controlled by morton topfer  chairman of our board of directors 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes includes taxes payable by our foreign subsidiaries 
for us tax purposes  all fiscal taxable income was offset by our available net operating loss carry forwards 
discontinued operations 
as a result of our restructuring plan  we sold all of the outstanding stock of terraillon in september and placed schaevitz uk into receivership in june we had net losses from these discontinued operations of  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and liquidity and capital resources operating working capital accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable increased by  from  as of march  to  as of march  the increase was attributable to an increase in accounts receivable of  from  at march  to  at march   a decrease in accounts payable of  from  at march  to  at march   and offset by a decrease in inventory of  from  at march  to  at march  the increase in accounts receivable is attributable to the improved sales in the sensors business and higher oem sales in march in the consumer products business  partially offset by a decrease in retail sales in the consumer product segment due to the conair transaction 
the decrease in accounts payable was primarily the result of our decision to accelerate payments to certain consumer product vendors in order to expedite the consolidation of financial systems used in our consumer products business 
the decrease in inventory is attributable to our continued inventory management efforts  and sales of  of thinner branded scale inventory to conair as part of the transaction 
cash provided by operating activities was  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was as a result of the company s overall performance improvement and reduced selling  general and administrative spending 
included in cash provided from operations for the fiscal year ended march  is  of costs paid to our insurance carrier related to the d o insurance policy renewal   paid to our former landlord related to the settlement of litigation related to the termination of the lease for our former valley forge  pennsylvania facility  and  of increased operating working capital  as described above 
excluding these payments towards litigation  restructuring  and changes in our working capital  cash provided by operations would have been investing activities included  of proceeds from the conair transaction 
in addition  capital spending increased to  for the fiscal year ended march  from  for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in capital spending is primarily attributable to investment in revenue generating projects at our shenzen  china facility 
financing activities for the fiscal year ended march  utilized  primarily due to the repayment of the remaining  of indebtedness to castletop capital  lp  and repayment of  of company debt under our revolving credit facility  leaving no outstanding borrowings at march  financing activities for the fiscal year ended march  also reflect  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
revolving credit facility on january   we entered into a  revolving credit facility with bank of america business capital formerly fleet capital corporation boa 
the revolving credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
interest accrues on the principal amount of our borrowings under this facility at a fluctuating rate per year equal to the lesser of boa s prime rate for commercial loans plus one percent subject to a two percent increase upon the occurrence of an event of default under the loan agreement or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law 
as of march   the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility was 
the amount of borrowing available under the revolving credit facility is determined in accordance with a formula based on certain of our accounts receivable and inventory 
the revolving credit facility expires on february  our revolving credit agreement requires us to meet certain financial covenants during the term of the revolving credit facility 
in addition to certain affirmative and negative covenants  which include a restriction on the payment of dividends  we were required to maintain a borrowing availability of at least  through the filing of our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended june  this covenant expired on august  in addition  we are required to keep a minimum fixed charge ratio of to at the end of each fiscal quarter 
fixed charge ratio is defined as operating cash flow  which is ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization minus cash taxes paid and minus capital expenditures  divided by the sum of scheduled principle payments and interest expense during that period 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants in the agreement 
as of march   there were no outstanding borrowings and we had the ability to borrow  under the revolving credit facility 
bridge loan on october   we received a  bridge loan from castletop capital  lp  a limited partnership controlled by morton topfer  chairman of our board of directors

dividends we have not declared cash dividends on our common equity 
additionally  the payment of dividends is prohibited under our credit agreement 
if permitted under applicable law and consented to by our lenders  we may  in the future  declare dividends under certain circumstances 
at present  there are no material restrictions on the ability of our hong kong subsidiary to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends  loans  advances  or purchases of materials  products  or services 
chinese laws and regulations  including currency exchange controls  restrict distribution and repatriation of dividends by our china subsidiary 
seasonality our sales of consumer products are seasonal  with highest sales during the second and third fiscal quarters 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
we compete on the basis of product design  features  and value 
accordingly  our revenues generally have kept pace with inflation  notwithstanding that inflation in the countries where our subsidiaries are located has been consistently higher than inflation in the united states 
increases in labor costs have not had a significant impact on our business because most of our employees are in china  where prevailing labor costs are low 
additionally  we believe that while we have not experienced any significant increases in materials costs  such increases are likely to affect the entire electronics industry and  accordingly  may not have a significant adverse effect on our competitive position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a certain level of foreign currency exchange risk 
the majority of our net sales are priced in united states dollars 
our costs and expenses are priced in united states dollars  hong kong dollars  and chinese renminbi 
accordingly  the competitiveness of our products relative to products produced domestically in foreign markets may be affected by the performance of the united states dollar compared with that of our foreign customers currencies 
additionally  we may be exposed to the risk of foreign currency transaction and translation losses  which might result from adverse fluctuations in the values of the hong kong dollar and the chinese renminbi 
at march   we had net assets of  subject to fluctuations in the value of the hong kong dollar and net assets of  subject to fluctuations in the value of the chinese renminbi 
at march   we had net liabilities of  subject to fluctuations in the value of the hong kong dollar and net assets of  subject to fluctuations in the value of the chinese renminbi 
fluctuations in the value of the hong kong dollar have not been significant since october   when the hong kong government tied the value of the hong kong dollar to that of the united states dollar 
however  there can be no assurance that the value of the hong kong dollar will continue to be tied to that of the united states dollar 
china adopted a floating currency system on january   unifying the market and official rates of foreign exchange 
the chinese government is currently reevaluating its foreign currency policy but is not expected to have any major changes in the foreseeable future 
china approved current account convertibility of the chinese renminbi on july   followed by formal acceptance of the international monetary fund s articles of agreement on december  these regulations eliminated the requirement for prior government approval to buy foreign exchange for ordinary trade transactions  though approval is still required to repatriate equity or debt  including interest thereon 
there can be no assurance that these currencies will remain stable or will fluctuate to our benefit 
to manage our exposure to foreign currency transaction and translation risks  we may purchase currency exchange forward contracts  currency options  or other derivative instruments  provided such instruments may be obtained at suitable prices 
however  to date we have not done so 
we are exposed to a certain level of interest rate risk 
interest on the principal amount of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility accrues at a fluctuating rate per year equal to the lesser of boa s prime rate for commercial loans plus one percent subject to a two percent increase upon the occurrence of an event of default under the loan agreement or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law 
our results will be adversely affected by any increase in interest rates 
for example  for every  of debt outstanding  an annual interest rate increase of basis points would increase interest expense and decrease our after tax profitability by we do not hedge this interest rate exposure 
as of march   the company did not have any long or short term debt
