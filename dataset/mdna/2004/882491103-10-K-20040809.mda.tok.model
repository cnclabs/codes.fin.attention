c narrative description of business cement  aggregate and concrete the cac business segment includes the manufacture and sale of cement  aggregates  ready mix concrete and other related products 
production and distribution facilities are concentrated primarily in texas  louisiana and california  with markets extending into contiguous states 
the company does not place heavy reliance on patents  franchises  licenses or concessions related to its cac operations 

table of contents cement txi s cement operations produce gray portland cement as its principal product 
also produced are specialty cements such as white portland  masonry and oil well 
cement production facilities are located at four sites in texas and california midlothian  texas  south of dallas fort worth  the largest cement plant in texas  hunter  texas  south of austin  and oro grande and crestmore  california  both near los angeles 
except for the crestmore facility  the limestone reserves used as the primary raw material are located on fee owned property adjacent to each of the plants 
raw material for the crestmore facility is purchased from multiple outside suppliers 
information regarding each of the company s facilities is as follows plant rated annual productive capacity of clinker short tons manufacturing process service date internally estimated minimum reserves years midlothian  tx  dry wet hunter  tx  dry oro grande  ca  dry crestmore  ca  dry n a total the company uses its patented cemstar sm process in both of its texas facilities and its oro grande  california facility to increase combined annual production by approximately 
the cemstar sm process adds slag  a co product of steel making  into a cement kiln along with the regular raw material feed 
the added slag serves to increase the production of clinker with little additional cost 
the primary fuel source for all of the company s facilities is coal  however  the company displaces approximately of its coal needs at its midlothian plant and approximately of its coal needs at its hunter plant by utilizing alternative fuels such as waste derived fuels and tires 
the company s facilities also consume large amounts of electricity obtained primarily under variable price firm supply contracts of short duration 
the company believes that adequate supplies of both fuel and electricity are readily available 
the company produced approximately million tons of finished cement in  million tons in and million tons in total annual shipments of finished cement were approximately million tons in  million tons in and million tons in  of which million tons in  million tons in and million tons in were shipped to outside trade customers 
the company markets its cement products in the southwestern united states 
the principal marketing area includes the states of texas  louisiana  oklahoma  california  nevada  arizona and utah 
sales offices are maintained throughout the marketing area and sales are made primarily to numerous customers in the construction industry  no one of which accounted for more than ten percent of the trade sales volume in cement is distributed by rail or truck to eight distribution terminals located throughout the marketing area 
the cement industry is highly competitive with suppliers differentiating themselves based on price  service and quality 

table of contents aggregates txi s aggregate operations  which produce sand  gravel  and crushed limestone  are conducted from facilities primarily serving the dallas fort worth  austin and houston areas in texas  the southern oklahoma area  and the alexandria  new orleans  baton rouge and monroe areas in louisiana 
the following table summarizes certain information about the company s aggregate production facilities 
type of facility and general location number of plants rated annual productive capacity internally estimated minimum reserves years crushed limestone north central south texas million tons oklahoma million tons sand gravel north central texas million tons central texas million tons louisiana million tons south central oklahoma million tons reserves identified with the facilities shown above and additional reserves available to support future plant sites are contained on approximately  acres of land  of which approximately  acres are owned in fee and the remainder leased 
the plants operated at percent of rated annual productive capacity for and sales for the year totaled million tons  of which approximately million tons were shipped to outside trade customers 
in addition  the company owns and operates three industrial sand plants and an aggregate blending facility 
the cost of transportation limits the marketing of aggregate products to the areas within approximately one hundred miles of the plant sites  therefore  sales are related to the level of construction activity near the plants 
the products are marketed by the company s sales organization located in the areas served by the plants and are sold to numerous customers  no one of which would be considered significant to the company s business 
products are distributed to trade customers principally by contract or customer owned haulers or through company owned rail distribution facilities 
ready mix concrete txi s ready mix concrete operations are situated in three areas in texas dallas fort worth denton  houston and east texas  in north and central louisiana  and at one location in southern arkansas 
the following table summarizes various information concerning these facilities 
location number of plants number of trucks texas louisiana arkansas the plants listed above are located on sites owned or leased by the company 
txi manufactures and supplies a substantial amount of the cement and aggregates used by the ready mix plants with the remainder being purchased from outside suppliers 
ready mix concrete is sold to various contractors in the construction industry  no one of which would be considered significant to the company s business 
the company believes that it is a significant participant in each of the texas and louisiana concrete products markets 
the principal methods of competition in concrete products markets are quality and service at competitive prices 

table of contents other products expanded shale and clay  a specialty aggregate product  is manufactured from facilities serving the dallas fort worth  austin and houston areas in texas  the oakland san francisco and los angeles areas in california  and the denver area in colorado

million cu 
yds 
the expanded shale and clay plants operated at percent of rated annual productive capacity for and sales for the year totaled approximately million cubic yards  of which approximately million cubic yards were shipped to outside trade customers 
the cost of transportation limits the marketing of expanded shale and clay products to the areas within approximately one hundred miles of the plant sites  therefore  sales are related to the level of construction activity near the plants 
the products are marketed by the company s sales organization located in the areas served by the plants and are sold to numerous customers  no one of which would be considered significant to the company s business 
products are distributed to trade customers principally by contract or customer owned haulers  and to a lesser extent by rail 
the company manufactures and markets prepackaged concrete and related products from plant or distribution sites owned by the company in the dallas fort worth  austin and houston areas in texas and bossier city  louisiana 
the products are marketed by the company s sales force in each of these locations  and are delivered primarily by contract haulers 
because the cost of delivery is significant to the overall cost of most of these products  the market area is generally restricted to within approximately one hundred miles of the plant locations 
these products are sold to various contractors  owners and distributors  no one of which would be considered significant to the company s business 
during  the company sold its clay brick and concrete block production facilities in texas and louisiana 

table of contents steel txi s steel facilities  located in midlothian  texas and dinwiddie county  virginia  produce a broad array of steel products 
txi uses its patented near net shape casting technology at both facilities 
the process involves casting molten steel into a shape that is closer to a product s final shape than traditional casting methods 
this technology provides energy and capital cost savings in the making of wide flange beams and other structural steel products 
the texas facility has two electric arc furnaces with continuous casters that feed melted steel to a bar mill  a structural mill and a large beam mill 
finished rolled products produced include beams up to twenty four inches wide  special bar quality products  merchant bar quality rounds  reinforcing bar and channels 
the virginia facility has one electric arc furnace and in line processing units consisting of two near net shape casters and a sophisticated rolling mill 
finished products produced include beams up to thirty six inches wide  sheet piling and h piling 
the rated annual capacities of the operating facilities are as follows rated annual productive capacity tons approximate facility square footage texas melting rolling virginia melting rolling the bar and structural mills produced approximately million tons of finished products in  million tons in and million tons in the principal raw material is recycled steel scrap 
shredded steel represents approximately of the raw material mix 
a major portion of the shredded steel requirements of the texas facility is produced by an on site shredder operation utilizing primarily crushed auto bodies purchased on the open market 
the company purchases shredded steel on the open market to meet the requirements of the virginia facility 
another grade of recycled steel scrap  heavy  representing approximately of the raw material mix is also purchased on the open market 
the purchase price of recycled steel scrap is subject to market forces largely beyond the company s control 
the supply of recycled steel scrap is expected to be adequate to meet future requirements 
steel mills with electric arc furnaces consume large amounts of electricity and natural gas 
electricity for the texas facility is obtained under variable price supply contracts typically of short duration 
electricity for the virginia facility is obtained from a local utility under an interruptible supply contract with price adjustments that reflect increases or decreases in the utility s fuel costs 
natural gas is obtained under supply contracts 
the company believes that adequate supplies of both electricity and natural gas are readily available 
the company s steel products are marketed by the company s sales organization throughout north america 
sales are primarily to steel service centers and steel fabricators for use in the construction industry  as well as to cold finishers  forgers and original equipment manufacturers for use in the railroad  defense  automotive  mobile home and energy industries 
the company does not place heavy reliance on franchises  licenses or concessions 
none of txi s customers accounted for more than ten percent of the steel segment s sales in sales to affiliates are minimal 
orders are generally filled within days and are cancelable 
delivery of finished products is accomplished by common carrier  contract or customer owned haulers  rail or barge 
the company competes with steel producers  including foreign producers  on the basis of price  quality and service 
certain of the foreign and domestic competitors  including both large integrated steel producers and mini mills  have substantially greater assets and larger sales organizations than txi 
intense sales competition exists for substantially all of txi s steel products 

table of contents risks relating to the company competition all of the markets in which the company participates are highly competitive 
the company competes in each of its cement  aggregate and concrete products markets with several other domestic suppliers of these products as well as with importers of foreign cement 
the company competes in its steel markets with national and international producers of steel products 
some of the company s competitors are larger  have greater financial resources and have less financial leverage than the company 
the company competes on the basis of  among other things  competitive prices  prompt availability  customer service and quality products 
sensitivity to economic cycles  seasonality and weather a significant percentage of the company s sales of both cac and steel products is attributable to the level of construction activity  which is affected by such cyclical factors as general economic conditions  availability of public funds  interest rates  inflation  consumer spending habits and employment 
the company s cac operating profit is generally lower in its fiscal quarter ended february as compared to the other three fiscal quarters due to the impact of winter weather on construction activity 
extended periods of inclement weather can adversely impact construction activity at other times of the year as well 
steel results are also affected by the company s shut downs scheduled every twelve to twenty four months to refurbish its steel production facilities 
growth strategy a significant element of the company s operating strategy is to pursue strategic acquisitions that either expand or complement the company s products or markets or to build new or expand existing production facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify and make acquisitions on acceptable terms  that the company will be able to obtain the permits necessary to build new or expand existing production facilities  that the company will be able to obtain financing for such acquisitions or expansions on acceptable terms or that the company will be able successfully to integrate such acquisitions into existing operations 
availability and pricing of raw materials and energy the company is dependent upon purchased recycled scrap steel as a raw material and upon the availability of energy sources  including electricity and fossil fuels 
accordingly  the company s results of operations and financial condition have in the past been  and may again in the future be adversely affected by increases in raw material costs or energy costs  or their lack of availability 
status of certain tariffs cac segment 
a group of domestic cement producers  including the company  filed antidumping petitions that have resulted in the imposition of significant antidumping duty cash deposits on gray portland cement and clinker imported from mexico and japan 
in addition  the us department of commerce has signed agreements with the venezuelan government and venezuelan cement producers  which are designed to eliminate the dumping and illegal subsidization of gray portland cement and clinker from venezuela 
on an annual basis  the antidumping duties are subject to review by the department of commerce to determine whether the current antidumping duty deposit rates should be adjusted upward or downward 
a substantial reduction or elimination of the existing antidumping duties could lower the company s results of operations 

table of contents in  the antidumping code of general agreement on tariffs and trade was substantially altered pursuant to the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations 
us legislation approving and implementing the uruguay round agreements requires the department of commerce and the us international trade commission itc to conduct sunset reviews of all outstanding antidumping and countervailing duty orders and suspension agreements  including the antidumping orders against gray portland cement and clinker from mexico and japan and the suspension agreements on gray portland cement and clinker from venezuela  to determine whether they should be terminated or remain in effect 
in  the department of commerce and the itc conducted sunset reviews of the antidumping orders and suspension agreements and determined that they should remain in effect until when the itc is scheduled to conduct another sunset review 
however  the itc determined that the suspension agreements with venezuela were no longer necessary 
mexican cement producers have appealed the itc sunset determination regarding imports from mexico to a dispute panel established under the north american free trade agreement 
the government of mexico has also requested consultations with the united states regarding the mexican cement antidumping order under world trade organization wto dispute settlement rules 
the consultations could lead to mexico filing a wto complaint challenging the department of commerce s and the itc s determinations in sunset reviews and the annual determination of the amount of duties 
in addition  the government of mexico has filed a request with the wto to form a dispute resolution panel regarding the united states antidumping order on mexican cement 
the exact schedule of the wto preceding is not yet established 
domestic cement producers have appealed the itc sunset review determinations regarding imports from venezuela to the us court of international trade 
although to date venezuelan imports have not competed in the company s markets to any significant degree  they may do so in the future 
independently owned cement operations could undertake to construct new import facilities and begin to purchase large quantities of low priced cement from countries not yet subject to antidumping orders  such as those in asia  which could not compete with domestic producers 
an influx of low priced cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders could lower the company s results of operations 
steel segment 
excessive imports of steel into the united states have  and may again in the future  exert downward pressure on us steel prices and significantly reduce the company s sales  margins and profitability 
some foreign steel producers are owned  controlled or subsidized by foreign governments 
as a result  decisions by these producers with respect to their production  sales and pricing are often influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions  realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss 
in july  complaints were filed with the itc and the us department of commerce by the company  northwestern steel wire co  nucor yamato steel co 
and the united steelworkers of america seeking to impose antidumping and countervailing duties against imports of structural steel beams from germany  japan  south korea and spain 
in june and july  the itc made respective determinations that an industry in the united states is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of such imports from japan and korea that the department of commerce has determined are subsidized and sold in the united states at less than fair value 
as a result of the itc s affirmative determinations  the department of commerce directed the us customs service to impose countervailing and antidumping duties on imports of certain structural steel beams from these two countries 
however  imports of structural steel beams from other countries increased significantly and the committee for fair beam imports composed of northwestern steel wire co  nucor corp  nucor yamato steel co 
and the company again petitioned the itc and the u 
s 
department of commerce concerning imports of certain structural steel beams from china  germany  luxembourg  russia  south africa  spain and taiwan 
on june   the itc determined that  although the department of commerce had determined that these imports were being sold in the united states at less than fair value  such imports did not materially injure or threaten with material injury an industry in the united states  and no antidumping duties were imposed on imports of structural steel beams from these countries 
existing duties are subject to annual review upon request 
a substantial reduction or elimination of the existing antidumping duties  or an influx of low priced steel products from countries not subject to antidumping orders  could again create downward pressure on us steel prices and  in turn  lower the company s results of operations 

table of contents impact of environmental laws the company s operations and those of its subsidiaries are subject to various federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern the generation  use  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  and provide for the investigation and remediation of contamination existing at current and former properties  and at third party waste disposal sites 
they have tended to become increasingly stringent over time 
as with others in its business  the company expends substantial amounts to comply with these laws and regulations  including amounts for pollution control equipment required to monitor and regulate wastewater discharges and air emissions 
the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies are charged with enforcing these laws and regulations  and these agencies can impose substantial fines and penalties  as well as curtail and or suspend the company s operations  for violations and non compliance 
moreover  certain of these laws and regulations permit private parties to bring actions against the company for injuries to persons and damages to property allegedly caused by its operations 
changes in environmental laws may interrupt production  increase the cost of compliance and hinder the company s ability to build new or expand production facilities 
emissions sources at the company s facilities are regulated by a combination of permit limitations and emission standards of national and statewide application 
the company believes it is in substantial compliance with its permit limitations and emission standards and regulations applicable to its existing facilities 
future changes in permit limitations and emission standards  however  may result in prolonged production interruption  significant costs of compliance or a hindrance of ability to build new or expand existing production facilities 
many of the raw materials  products and by products associated with the operation of any industrial facility  including those for the production of steel  cement or concrete products  contain chemical elements or compounds that can be designated as hazardous 
such raw materials  products and by products may also exhibit characteristics that result in their being classified as a hazardous substance or waste 
some examples are the metals present in cement kiln dust ckd  electric arc furnace dust eaf dust generated by the company s steel facilities and the ignitability of the waste derived fuels that the company uses as a primary or supplementary fuel substitute for nonrenewable coal and natural gas to fire certain of its cement kilns 
currently  ckd is exempt from hazardous waste management standards under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra if certain tests are satisfied 
the company has demonstrated that the ckd it generates satisfies these tests 
however  the epa plans to apply site specific waste management standards to ckd under the clean air act and rcra to assure that the environment is protected 
the company has established operating practices and is implementing waste management programs that it believes will comply with these anticipated standards  but such practices and programs may not continue to comply in the future if regulations become more restrictive 
the company utilizes hazardous materials such as gasoline  acids  solvents and chemicals as well as materials that have been designated or characterized as hazardous waste by the epa  which it utilizes for energy recovery 
this requires the company to familiarize its work force with the more exacting requirements of applicable environmental laws and regulations with respect to human health and the environment related to these activities 
the failure to observe these exacting requirements could jeopardize the company s hazardous waste management permits and  under certain circumstances  expose it to significant liabilities and costs of cleaning up releases of hazardous substances into the environment or claims by employees or others alleging exposure to hazardous substances 
the company s steel facilities generate  in the same manner as other similar steel plants in the industry  eaf dust that contains lead  chromium and cadmium 
the epa has listed this eaf dust  which is collected in baghouses  as hazardous waste 
the company has contracts with reclamation facilities in the united states and mexico pursuant to which such facilities receive the eaf dust generated by the company and recover the metals from the dust for reuse  thus rendering the dust non hazardous 
in addition  the company is continually investigating alternative reclamation technologies and has implemented processes for diminishing the amount of eaf dust generated 
the company intends to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment and health and safety matters  but since many of these requirements are subjective and therefore not quantifiable  are presently not determinable  or are likely to be affected by future legislation or rule making by government agencies  it is not possible to accurately predict the aggregate future costs of compliance and their effect on the company s operations  future net income or financial condition 
notwithstanding the company s intentions to comply with all legal requirements  if injury to persons or damage to property or contamination of the environment has been or is caused by the conduct of its business or hazardous substances or wastes used in  generated or disposed of by it  the company may be liable for such injuries and damages  and be required to pay the cost of investigation and remediation of such contamination 
the amount of such liability could be material and the company may incur material liability in connection with possible claims related to its operations and properties under environmental  health and safety laws 

table of contents equipment failure due to the high fixed cost nature of the company s business  interruptions in its production capabilities may cause the company s productivity and results of operations to decline significantly during the affected period 
the company s manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment  such as its cement kilns  grinding mills  stone crushers  steel furnaces  continuous casters and rolling equipment  as well as electrical equipment  such as transformers 
this equipment may  on occasion  be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or damaged during accidents  which may lead to production curtailments and shutdowns 
in addition to equipment failures  its facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires  explosions or violent weather conditions 
earthquakes the company s operations in california are susceptible to damage from earthquakes 
any significant earthquake damage could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company maintains only a limited amount of earthquake insurance and  therefore  is not fully insured against earthquake risk 
other items employees txi has approximately  employees  employed in cac operations   employed in steel operations and the balance employed in corporate resources 
intellectual property while the company maintains trademarks such as txi and maximizer and process patents such as cemstar sm and near net shape casting  the company does not believe any of its active trademarks or patents are essential to the company s business as a whole 
real estate the company is involved in the development of its surplus real estate and real estate acquired for development of high quality industrial and multi use parks in the metropolitan areas of dallas fort worth and houston  texas

structural steel sales increased million on higher shipments and higher average realized prices 
bar mill sales increased million on higher shipments and higher realized prices 
operating costs 
steel cost of products sold at million  including depreciation and amortization  increased million 
the increased costs were the result of higher shipments and the effect of higher raw material costs on unit costs partially offset by improved operating efficiencies at the virginia facility due to increased production levels 
the company has experienced unprecedented increases in the cost of steel scrap  the principal raw material used in its steel production 
as a result of these increases in scrap costs the company incurred a charge to value inventories using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting of million in compared to million in the prior year

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in the facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more complex judgments and estimates 
receivables 
management evaluates the ability to collect accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
a reserve for doubtful accounts is maintained based on the length of time receivables are past due or the status of a customer s financial condition 
if the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to make required payments  specific amounts are added to the reserve 
environmental liabilities

instead  the convertible subordinated debentures held by the trust which previously were eliminated in the company s consolidated financial statements are reported on its balance sheet 
distributions on the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities are no longer reported on the company s statements of operations  but interest on the debentures is recorded as interest expense
