item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements and risk factors you should read the following discussion together with pall s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information in this form k report 
the discussions under the subheadings review of market segments and geographies below are in local currency unless indicated otherwise 
management considers local currency growth an important measure because by excluding the volatility of exchange rates  underlying volume growth is clearer 
as used below  indicates that we have rounded the relevant data up or down to the nearest one half percentage point 
dollar amounts discussed below are in thousands  unless otherwise indicated and except per share dollar amounts 
in addition  per share dollar amounts are discussed on a diluted basis 
the matters discussed in this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are based on current company management expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the matters discussed below under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates  as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  regulatory approval and market acceptance of new technologies  changes in product mix and product pricing and in interest rates and cost of raw materials  the company s success in enforcing its patents and protecting its proprietary products and manufacturing techniques  global and regional economic conditions and legislative  regulatory and political developments  and domestic and international competition in the company s global markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from estimates 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and that require judgment 
see also the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies 
purchase accounting and goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with sfas no 
is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
there are various methods used to estimate the value of tangible and intangible assets acquired  such as discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables  and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to comparables 
there are also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
the company performs goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  the company could be required to strategically realign its resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
based on impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal and revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when contractual terms have been fulfilled 
long term contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete them 
the cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change  including anticipated losses 
such revisions could result in a material adjustment in the period of the change 

back to contents allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when collection becomes doubtful 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  management reserves an amount believed to be uncollectible 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost principally on the first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon assumptions about historic usage  future demand and market conditions 
these adjustments are estimates which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
recoverability of available for sale investments other than temporary losses relating to available for sale investments are recognized in earnings when management determines that the recoverability of the cost of the investment is unlikely 
such losses could result in a material adjustment in the period of the change 
management considers numerous factors  on a case by case basis  in evaluating whether the decline in market value of an available for sale security below cost is other than temporary 
such factors include  but are not limited to  i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer of the investment  and iii whether the company s intent to retain the investment for the period of time is sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
pension plans the company sponsors pension plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to those plans for which the benefit is actuarially determined ie  defined benefit plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to calculate the liabilities and expense 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience in the short term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
pension expense associated with our defined benefit plans was  in fiscal  which was based on a weighted average discount rate of calculated using the projected benefit obligation and a weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets of calculated using the fair value of plan assets 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
if the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by basis points  projected pension expense in would have increased approximately  the discount rates used for defined benefit plans are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds in each country eg  in the eg  moody s aa or better 
if the weighted average discount rate was reduced by basis points  pension expense in would have increased by approximately  accrued expenses and contingencies management estimates certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
the most material accrual relates to environmental proceedings 
environmental accruals are recorded based upon historical costs incurred and estimates for future costs of remediation and on going legal expenses which have a high degree of uncertainty 
when no estimate in a given range is deemed to be better than any other  the low end of the range is accrued 
self insured workers compensation insurance accruals are recorded based on insurance claims processed including applied loss development factors 
employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on medical claims processed as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
differences between estimates and assumptions and actual results could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 

back to contents income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which such a determination is made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which such determination is made 
united states income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which totaled  at july  since substantially all such earnings are expected to be permanently invested in foreign operations 
dividend distributions in excess of current earnings or the sale or other disposition of an investment in a foreign subsidiary would cause temporary differences related to undistributed earnings to become taxable 
determination of a hypothetical deferred tax liability  based upon the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  is not practicable due to the indeterminate nature of underlying assumptions 
results of operations compared with review of consolidated results sales for the fiscal year increased to billion from billion in fiscal year exchange rates increased reported sales in the year by  or  primarily due to the strengthening of the euro and to a lesser extent the british pound and japanese yen 
in local currency ie  had exchange rates not changed year over year  sales increased 
overall  a decrease in pricing reduced sales by about  which was offset by an increase in volume of 
sales growth was negatively impacted by a decline in aerospace segment sales attributable to last year s non recurring sales related to the iraqi conflict 
excluding the impact of these non recurring sales  consolidated sales in local currency increased 
sales growth was strong in our microelectronics segment as the semiconductor industry continued to rebound 
sales in our medical segment were up in the mid single digit range 
biopharmaceuticals segment sales were flat  while general industrial segment sales posted low single digit growth 
by geography  asia reported double digit sales growth  while the western hemisphere achieved mid single digit growth 
the growth in asia and the western hemisphere was partly offset by a decline in sales in europe  primarily attributable to lower aerospace sales 
we expect overall sales in local currency to grow in the mid single digit range in fiscal for a detailed discussion of sales  refer to review of market segments and geographies 
cost of sales in fiscal  as a percentage of sales  increased to from in fiscal the increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales reflects the impact of product mix as well as volume changes in our aerospace segment and the impact of a pricing decrease in our medical segment 
we are expecting a modest improvement in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  in fiscal due to price increases and as the impact of our cost reduction initiatives see below for a discussion of our cost reduction programs ramps up 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal decreased to as compared to last year 
the improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects synergies achieved related to our fsg integration efforts and the effects of our cost reduction programs  partly offset by increased pension and consulting costs as well as the impact of foreign exchange 
foreign exchange is estimated to have increased selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately  in fiscal the increase in consulting costs relates primarily to our cost reduction programs as well as sarbanes oxley compliance initiatives 

back to contents we continue to move forward with our four cost reduction initiatives 
we are targeting  in savings on an annualized basis related to our indirect expenditure cost reduction initiatives for items such as freight  office supplies  parcel delivery and travel 
as we are still in the startup phase  net savings from the program approximated  for this fiscal year in the western hemisphere 
in fiscal  the programs will expand to europe and asia and our expected savings as a result of the program should approximate  our other three cost reduction initiatives  which focus on our cost of manufacturing  are the direct materials strategic sourcing  continuous improvement program and our manufacturing rationalization program 
we expect to achieve  in savings in fiscal and continuing savings in fiscal as a result of these efforts 
we are also in the process of creating an integrated business approach within the company that will be organized around three operating segments life sciences  comprising medical and biopharmaceuticals  aeropower  comprising aerospace and the machinery equipment portion of the current general industrial segment  and process technologies  comprising general industrial s food beverage  fuels chemicals  power generation  municipal water divisions and microelectronics 
each of these vertically integrated segments will now have global responsibility for its own manufacturing  research and development r d  sales and marketing enabling us to better meet our customer s current and future needs while achieving greater efficiencies and profit growth with this leaner  customer centric structure 
we are expecting to achieve a modest improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  in fiscal year r d expenses were of sales in fiscal  on par with last year 
we have programs in place to monitor spending and ensure that r d resources are used efficiently 
we expect r d as a percentage of sales to increase slightly in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded restructuring and other charges  net  of  the restructuring and other charges  net  reflect severance and other costs incurred as a result of the streamlining of our manufacturing operations in the united kingdom uk  japan and germany and reorganizing our medical and biosciences management structure  as well as the sale of certain insignificant non core manufacturing businesses in germany 
additionally  restructuring and other charges  net  reflects an increase in our environmental liabilities of  principally as a result of a change in the estimated duration and costs of the remediation effort at the ann arbor  michigan facility of the company s subsidiary gelman sciences  partly offset by a gain on the sale of our investment in oiltools international and non recurring income related to a decrease of pension liabilities in germany 
the adjustment to pension liabilities was due to an over accrual of pension expense that occurred during the preceding five year period  the effect of which was not significant in any period 
in fiscal  we recorded restructuring and other charges of  reflecting the write off of in process research and development acquired in the fsg acquisition of  and restructuring and other charges of  primarily severance and other exit costs 
the fiscal charges were primarily related to the fsg acquisition and the realignment of our life sciences business  including the transfer of medical manufacturing from ireland 
the details of the charges for the years ended july  and august  can be found in the restructuring and other charges note accompanying the consolidated financial statements 
in general  we expect to recover the costs of the restructuring related charges within two years from the date of the charge 
the following table summarizes the activity for fiscal related to restructuring liabilities that were recorded in fiscal  and severance lease termination liabilities other total fiscal balance at aug 
 additions   utilized   balance at july    fiscal balance at aug 
    utilized    other changes a balance at july    
back to contents severance lease termination liabilities other total fiscal balance at aug 
   utilized reversal of excess reserves b other changes a balance at july  a reflects the reversal of excess restructuring accruals related to the fsg acquisition that were originally recorded as adjustments to goodwill in accordance with eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
b reflects the reversal in fiscal year of excess restructuring reserves recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings in fiscal year net interest expense decreased  compared to fiscal the reduction in net interest expense reflects decreased borrowings as we continue to utilize cash flow to pay down debt 
refer to the liquidity and capital resources section of this management s discussion and analysis for a discussion of the reduction in net and gross debt 
in fiscal we expect interest expense to be flat compared with fiscal in fiscal the underlying tax rate was compared with last year reflecting increased earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions 
we expect an underlying tax rate of in fiscal net earnings in fiscal were  or per share  compared with net earnings of  or cents per share in fiscal in summary  net earnings benefited from organic sales growth  increased gross profit dollars generated by a higher level of sales  decreased interest expense and the benefit of foreign exchange rates 
an increase in selling  general and administrative expense dollars pension and consulting related to the cost reduction program and sarbanes oxley initiatives and the impact of a higher underlying tax rate partly offset the above 
in addition  fiscal included restructuring and other charges  net  of  primarily an adjustment to our environmental reserves  restructuring costs related to our uk  german and japan operations and the reorganization of our medical and biosciences management structure partly offset by a gain on the sale of our investment in oiltools international and an adjustment of pension liabilities in germany  whereas fiscal included the write off of in process research and development acquired in the fsg acquisition of  and severance and other charges of  we estimate that foreign currency translation added approximately cents to earnings per share in fiscal we expect earnings per share for fiscal year to be in the range of to per share 
in light of the cost reduction initiatives  we expect to incur severance and other restructuring costs in fiscal  however  since these costs are not estimable at this time  this range does not contemplate such charges 

back to contents review of market segments and geographies market segments the table below presents sales for the fiscal years ended july  and august  by market segment including the effect of exchange rates for comparative purposes 
fiscal fiscal change exchange rate difference change in local currency medical    biopharmaceuticals    total life sciences    general industrial    aerospace    microelectronics    total industrial    total    life sciences sales increased in fiscal compared with last year 
life sciences represented approximately of our total sales in fiscal consistent with last year 
within life sciences  medical segment sales grew driven by mid single growth in medical s blood filtration submarket 
sales in medical s critical care submarket were flat compared with last year 
by geography  the western hemisphere and europe posted good growth in medical sales year over year 
sales in asia  which comprises the smallest portion of our medical business  were down 
there continues to be increasing core market demand for our blood filtration products and we offer a broad product portfolio to our customers 
new water filtration products for medical applications such as the aquasafe filter are growing 
we have introduced our enhanced bacterial detection system to blood centers and it has just begun contributing to sales as blood centers comply with an american association of blood banks standard  which requires all platelets to be tested for bacteria 
the blood bank market is highly competitive throughout the world and is characterized by various national and private tender processes 
we have successfully extended for a further year through april our contract with our largest blood bank customer  while another large blood bank customer has notified us that their contract will not be renewed beyond its expiration 
we expect to maintain our overall market share 
overall  we expect sales in our medical segment to grow in the mid single digit range for the full year fiscal biopharmaceuticals segment sales declined slightly in fiscal within biopharmaceuticals  sales in its pharmaceutical submarket which comprise approximately three quarters of our biopharmaceuticals segment were flat  reflecting the recent distress in the plasma fractionation industry 
in addition  the timing of capital orders in the biotechnology industry negatively impacted sales growth 
by geography  mid single digit growth in asia was offset by a decrease in the western hemisphere 
sales in europe were flat 
industry reports suggest that the plasma industry is projected to recover progressively through fiscal  and it is our expectation that we will recoup most of these sales 
in biosciences  the other biopharmaceuticals submarket  sales were down 
the decline in biosciences reflects a weakness in the laboratory portion of the business  which continues to be affected by research spending cuts 
our strategy for growth in this business is through the introduction of new products and applications 
an example of our expansion in the diagnostics market is our pallcheck luminometer and recently for the first time the fda approved the manufacture of a prescription drug that uses this microbiological test 
as such  based on the fda s approval there is potential for this method to replace traditional technologies in the future 
sales in the specialty materials part of our biosciences business were up 
by geography  the decline in biosciences sales reflects shortfalls in europe and the western hemisphere partly offset by growth in asia 
overall  for the full year fiscal  we expect sales in our biopharmaceuticals segment to grow in the high single digits 
our industrial business accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal  consistent with last year 
industrial sales grew as compared with fiscal growth in microelectronics was strong  while general industrial segment sales  which account for about of our industrial business  were up 
aerospace sales were down 

back to contents within general industrial  all submarkets contributed to the increase in sales in fiscal sales in our power generation submarket increased with all geographies contributing to this gain 
the western hemisphere has benefited from a large water filtration sale to a power station in denver  colorado and all geographies have benefited from our total fluid management approach 
sales in our fuels chemicals submarket grew reflecting strong sales in asia partly offset by a decline in the western hemisphere 
sales in europe were up modestly 
we expect continued strong investment by customers in the fuels chemicals market into fiscal sales in our machinery equipment submarket increased slightly  as strong growth in asia and modest growth in the western hemisphere were largely offset by a decline in europe 
sales in the western hemisphere and europe have been negatively impacted by difficult industry conditions 
in addition  sales in europe were reduced due to the sale of our german machine and tool unit in the second quarter of fiscal excluding the sales related to the machine tool unit  machinery equipment sales were up 
the business outlook has been improving in the machinery equipment submarket due in part to the large global acceptance of our new flagship product  ultipleat srt  which we launched in the second quarter 
sales in water processing increased  driven by strong growth in the western hemisphere 
sales in the western hemisphere have been positively impacted by more stringent epa regulations 
there continues to be significant potential in our water processing business 
we expect continued growth in asia as water shortages and population pressures  in china  in particular  are creating new opportunities for our products 
sales in our food beverage submarket increased  driven by strong growth in the western hemisphere 
in the fourth quarter  sales in this market reached a record million 
we have successfully applied our total fluid management solutions to the wine  soft drink and spirits market and we are now the sole supplier of filtration and separation products to some large global customers 
overall  we expect sales in our general industrial segment to grow in the high single digits in fiscal aerospace sales decreased  reflecting a decline in military sales of in europe and asia partly offset by an increase in commercial sales of 
the decline in military sales reflects a difficult comparison  as fiscal reflected non recurring sales related to the iraqi conflict estimated at about million 
excluding the impact of the nonrecurring sales  total aerospace sales increased 
military sales comprised approximately of total aerospace sales compared with last year 
we expect low single digit growth in aerospace sales in fiscal microelectronics sales grew compared with last year as the recovery of the cyclical semiconductor market continues 
in the fourth quarter sales increased  marking the third consecutive quarter of achieving strong double digit growth 
growth for the year was driven by the western hemisphere and asia where sales increased and  respectively 
sales in europe  the smallest of our microelectronics markets  declined 
while last year we initially saw growth in the macro side of the semiconductor market digital displays  information storage  ink jet printing  we are now beginning to see growth across the whole spectrum of the market  including increased oem activity and fab upgrades and production 
we are well positioned to take advantage of this recovery with our leading edge products and by applying these products across the digital desktop 
one of our strategies for this business is to reduce vulnerability to cyclical changes 
we are working on several new initiatives  particularly breather filter sales to the thin film rigid disc market  which we hope will generate sales by the time the next downturn occurs in the semiconductor industry 
industry indicators support our current projection of low double digit sales growth in this segment in fiscal the consolidated operating profit as a percentage of sales declined to from last year 
in life sciences  overall operating profit was compared with last year reflecting a decline in biopharmaceuticals operating profit margin partly offset by an improvement in medical 
within life sciences  medical operating profit improved to from last year 
operating profit dollars increased by  or 
the improvement in operating profit reflects manufacturing based cost reduction programs and synergies realized as a result of the reorganization of the critical care and blood businesses refer to the restructuring and other charges note accompanying the consolidated financial statements for discussion of actions taken in fiscal partly offset by a decrease in pricing 
operating profit in biopharmaceuticals declined to of sales  from last year reflecting a change in product mix 
operating profit dollars increased  or  reflecting increased sales on a reported basis 
overall operating profit margins in industrial declined to from last year 
general industrial operating profit improved to from last year  while operating profit dollars increased by  or 
aerospace operating profit declined to from  while operating profit dollars decreased  or  reflecting lower military sales as discussed above 
microelectronics operating profit increased to from last year  while operating profit dollars increased  or 
the increase in microelectronics operating profit margin and dollars reflects the strong growth in sales as discussed above 

back to contents geographies the table below presents sales for the fiscal years ended july  and august  to unaffiliated customers by geography including the effect of exchange rates for comparative purposes 
fiscal fiscal change exchange rate difference change in local currency western hemisphere    europe    asia    total    by geography  sales in the western hemisphere increased year over year 
exchange rates increased sales by  primarily related to the strengthening of the canadian dollar  resulting in reported sales growth of 
operating profit increased to of sales as compared with last year 
operating profit dollars increased  or reflecting the increase in sales 
in europe  sales declined compared with last year 
the decline in sales reflects the impact of the non recurring aerospace sales related to the iraqi conflict  which were recorded in fiscal the strengthening of european currencies added  in sales resulting in reported sales growth of 
operating profit declined to of sales from last year  while operating profit dollars were flat 
the decrease in operating profit margin primarily reflects a shift in product mix and the decline in aerospace sales 
sales in asia increased as compared to last year 
the strengthening of asian currencies added  in sales  resulting in reported sales growth of 
the increase in sales resulted from strong growth in general industrial and microelectronics sales as cited above 
in addition  sales have been favorably impacted by a shift from the way fsg recorded sales through their us and european manufacturing sites to the way pall records sales through local sales companies 
this shift resulted in sales being recorded in asia that would have been recorded in the western hemisphere and europe under the fsg methodology 
operating profit increased to of sales from last year  reflecting the strong sales growth as discussed above 
operating profit dollars increased  or 
general corporate expenses increased  compared with fiscal  reflecting increased pension  consulting and insurance costs partly offset by savings achieved as a result of our cost reduction program 
results of operations compared with review of consolidated results sales for the fiscal year increased to billion from billion in fiscal year exchange rates increased reported sales in the year by  or  primarily due to the strengthening of the euro and to a lesser extent the british pound and japanese yen  partly offset by the weakening of the argentine peso 
in local currency ie  had exchange rates not changed year over year  sales increased 
overall  pricing had a positive impact on sales  contributing to our top line growth 
for a detailed discussion of sales  refer to review of market segments and geographies below 
compared with last year s pro forma sales which include fsg s sales for the nine months ended march   sales increased with all segments contributing to this gain 
growth was particularly strong in aerospace which did not benefit from the fsg acquisition  microelectronics and biopharmaceuticals 
the pro forma sales growth is provided to give an indication of what comparable sales growth would have been had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of fiscal however  it is not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred if the acquisition had been consummated at that date due to many factors 
these factors include different market approaches and routes to market eg  direct sales versus distribution  product rationalization and pricing 
cost of sales in fiscal  as a percentage of sales  was as compared with in fiscal the year over year comparison of cost of sales reflects the benefit of foreign exchange partly offset by the effect of fsg product margins 
in addition  the year over year comparison reflects the inclusion of a one time purchase accounting adjustment of  in fiscal we consider this item to be non recurring in nature because  although we acquired the manufacturing operations of fsg  this adjustment was required by sfas no 
as an elimination of the manufacturing profit of inventory acquired from fsg and sold in fiscal 
back to contents selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal declined 
to from in fiscal the percentage improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects synergies achieved related to our fsg integration efforts and the effects of our cost reduction programs  offset by the impact of increased bonus  pension  consulting and insurance costs  foreign exchange estimated to have increased selling  general and administrative expenses by about  for the year and expenses related to the integration of fsg 
we have identified  in annualized cost synergies that we expect to realize by the end of fiscal year as a result of our integration of fsg 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we achieved the run rate to accomplish this objective 
we are continuing to evaluate other potential cost savings as well 
in fiscal  pension costs increased approximately  excluding increases related to fsg pension due to the downturn in the equities market and decreased interest rates 
in addition  insurance premiums increased approximately  research and development r d expenses declined to of sales from in fiscal  reflecting the elimination of shared research costs with vi technologies vitex  partly offset by the impact of fsg s r d 
as a result of the modification of our partnership agreement to eliminate shared research costs  the fourth quarter of fiscal included our final r d payment to vitex 
in fiscal  we recorded restructuring and other charges of  reflecting the write off of in process research and development acquired in the fsg acquisition of  severance costs of  asset write offs of  and other exit costs of  the fiscal charges were primarily related to the fsg acquisition and the realignment of our life sciences business refer to the segment information and geographies note accompanying the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the reorganization of our life sciences business including the transfer of medical manufacturing from ireland 
in fiscal  we recorded restructuring  other charges and adjustments of  reflecting severance costs of  asset write offs of and other exit costs of  a one time purchase accounting adjustment of  included in cost of sales  an addition of  to a previously established environmental remediation reserve and a  write down of two strategic investments 
the details of the charges for fiscal and fiscal can be found in the restructuring and other charges note accompanying the consolidated financial statements 
we expect to recover the costs of the restructuring related charges within two years from the date of the charge 
net interest expense increased  in fiscal as compared with fiscal reflecting increased borrowings during the first nine months of fiscal to fund the fsg acquisition partly offset by the effect of our receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swaps 
refer to the financial instruments and risks and uncertainties note accompanying the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our interest rate swaps 
in fiscal  the tax rate was due to the non deductibility of the in process research and development charge taken in the first quarter 
the underlying effective tax rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal the improvement in the underlying effective rate in fiscal was a result of fine tuning our tax planning strategies in the first quarter of fiscal net earnings in fiscal were  or cents per share  compared with net earnings of  or cents per share in fiscal in summary  net earnings in fiscal benefited from organic sales growth  the impact of the fsg acquisition  the controlling of expenses and the benefit of foreign exchange rates  partly offset by the effect of lower margins on sales of fsg products  restructuring and other charges and increased interest costs related to borrowings to fund the fsg acquisition 
we estimate that foreign exchange translation added cents to earnings per share for the year 

back to contents review of market segments and geographies market segments the table below presents sales by market segment with the prior period restated to reflect the life sciences reorganization as discussed in the segment information and geographies note accompanying the consolidated financial statements  including the effect of exchange rates for comparative purposes

life sciences represented approximately of our total sales in fiscal as compared with approximately last year 
within life sciences  medical segment sales declined reflecting a decrease in blood sales of partly offset by an increase in critical care of 
the decline in blood sales was primarily due to a decrease in the level of blood donations as compared with last year 
by geography  medical sales in the western hemisphere and europe were down  while sales in asia were flat 
biopharmaceuticals segment sales grew as compared with last year 
sales on a pro forma basis grew 
growth in biopharmaceuticals was attributable to our pharmaceutical sub market where sales increased compared with last year 
this sub market has benefited from the increased production in the biotechnology industry  which is driving growth 
all geographies reported strong growth in the pharmaceuticals sub market 
in biosciences  the other sub market in our biopharmaceuticals segment  sales were down reflecting a major change from direct sales to distributors 
in addition  sales were down in the specialty materials part of our biosciences business 
by geography  the decline in biosciences reflects shortfalls in europe and the western hemisphere 
in asia  biosciences sales increased 

back to contents our industrial business  where the majority of fsg s sales are reported  accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal as compared with last year 
industrial sales grew as compared with fiscal primarily due to the acquisition of fsg 
sales on a pro forma basis increased reflecting strong growth in aerospace and microelectronics 
general industrial segment sales  which are the largest portion of our industrial business  grew with all geographies contributing to this gain 
all sub markets within general industrial reported strong sales growth compared with last year 
on a pro forma basis  general industrial sales were down 
within general industrial  sales in our water processing sub market increased reflecting our continued successful pilot testing at municipal sites and our market penetration in eastern europe and asia 
process enhancements in this sub market continue to help us gain market share 
sales in our food beverage sub market grew as the integration of fsg technologies and expertise has significantly broadened our breadth and reach 
all geographies contributed to this gain 
growth in europe and asia reflects the impact of the emerging beer markets in eastern europe and china 
sales in our fuels chemicals sub market grew 
strategic partnerships are creating excellent growth opportunities in this market and a key growth driver continues to be clean fuels and synthetic fuels initiatives based on environmental driven regulations 
sales in our machinery equipment sub market grew  despite difficult industry conditions  with all geographies contributing to this gain 
sales in our power generation sub market increased 
power generation sales growth was strong in europe and asia 
in the western hemisphere  power generation sales were down as there has been some weakening in the oem turbine market 
aerospace sales grew  reflecting strong military sales 
military sales  which were boosted by the middle east conflict  grew year over year 
all geographies contributed to the growth in military sales

liquidity and capital resources on august   we entered into a five year  unsecured senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks  which expires on august  simultaneously  we borrowed  under this facility and used the proceeds principally to repay   outstanding as of july  of borrowings under our existing  unsecured senior revolving credit facility entered into on august   the  balance due on a  bank loan which otherwise was to mature on october  and various fees associated with the new facility 
both the  revolving credit facility and the  term loan were terminated upon the execution of the new revolving credit facility 
as a result of the new revolving credit facility  our borrowing capacity has increased by  net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was  a decrease of  as compared with fiscal the decrease in cash flow reflects changes in working capital items such as accounts receivable  inventory and income tax payable partly offset by cash generated from increased earnings 
free cash flow  which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures  was  in fiscal  as compared with  in fiscal the decrease in free cash flow reflects the factors mentioned above partly offset by a lower level of capital expenditures 
for the full year fiscal  we expect free cash flow to approximate  based upon the mid point of the earnings guidance above and assuming no changes in working capital 
we believe this measure is important because it is a key element of our planning 
we utilize free cash flow  which is a non gaap measure  as one way to measure our current and future financial performance

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary market risks relate to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the sensitivity analyses presented below assume simultaneous shifts in each respective rate  and quantify the impact on our earnings and cash flows 
the changes used for these analyses reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
actual changes that differ from the changes used for these analyses could yield materially different results 
foreign currency our reporting currency is the us dollar 
because we operate through subsidiaries or branches in over thirty countries around the world  our earnings are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of the subsidiaries or branches  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
we estimate that foreign exchange translation added cents to earnings per share in fiscal year most of our products are manufactured in the us  including puerto rico  germany and the united kingdom  and then sold into many countries 
the primary foreign currency exposures relate to adverse changes in the relationships of the us dollar to the british pound the pound  the japanese yen the yen and the euro  as well as adverse changes in the relationship of the pound to the euro 
exposure exists when the functional currency of the buying subsidiaries weakens against the us dollar  the pound or the euro thus causing an increase of the product cost to the buying subsidiary  which adversely affects the company s consolidated gross margin and net earnings 
the effect of foreign exchange is partially mitigated because of the significant level of manufacturing done in europe 
the deterioration of the yen against the us dollar has a greater proportional adverse effect on our earnings because the majority of japan s purchases are sourced from the us in fiscal year  the euro  the pound and the yen appreciated by approximately  and  respectively  against the us dollar compared with the average exchange rates in effect in fiscal additionally  the euro appreciated against the pound by approximately 
due to the difficulty in estimating the economic effect of foreign currency rates  particularly in periods of high volatility of such rates  we do not provide such estimated effects and report only the translation effect to earnings per share disclosed above 
we are also exposed to transaction risk from adverse changes in exchange rates 
these short term transaction exposures are primarily yen denominated receivables held in the us and euro denominated receivables held in the united kingdom 
these short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are managed by purchasing forward foreign exchange contracts forwards to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
in addition  we enter into loans denominated in foreign currencies to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables 
we do not enter into forwards for trading purposes 
at july   these exposures amounted to approximately  and were offset by forwards with a notional principal amount of  if a hypothetical simultaneous adverse change had occurred in exchange rates  net earnings would have decreased by approximately  or approximately cent per share 
interest rates we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily due to our financing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt as well as cash and certain short term  highly liquid investments considered to be cash equivalents 
our debt portfolio is comprised of a combination of fixed rate and floating rate borrowings 
factoring in the effect of our interest rate swaps on our debt  at july  our debt portfolio was variable rate debt 
as such  we view our primary interest rate risk to be potential near term decreases in earnings and cash flows due to increases in variable interest rates 
the cash flows on the above mentioned interest rate swaps mirror the cash flows of the hedged underlying debt instruments 
we do not enter into interest rate swaps for trading purposes 
as of july   we had interest rate swaps with notional amounts aggregating  outstanding comprised of fair value interest rate swaps ie  fixed to variable rate swaps of  and cash flow interest rate swaps ie  variable to fixed rate swaps of  the fair value of our interest rate swaps at july  was a liability of  for the year ended july   interest expense  net of interest income  was  a hypothetical increase in market interest rates over the actual fiscal average rate would increase net interest expense by
