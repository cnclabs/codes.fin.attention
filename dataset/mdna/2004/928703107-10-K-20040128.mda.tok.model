the insurance policies have various premium rating plans that establish the ultimate premium to be paid 
prior to march   the amount of the additional or return premium was finalized 
subsequent thereto  adjustments to premium will be made based upon the level of claims incurred at a future date up to three years after the end of the respective policy period 
for the policy year ending march   a maximum premium has been predetermined 
management evaluates the accrual  and the underlying assumptions  regularly throughout the year and makes adjustments as needed 
the ultimate premium cost may be greater than or less than the established accrual 
while management believes that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurances that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
in the event it is determined that a smaller or larger accrual is appropriate  the company would record a credit or a charge to cost of services in the period in which such determination is made 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks results of operations the information that appears below relates to prior periods 
the results of operations for those periods are not necessarily indicative of the results  which may be expected for any subsequent period 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the operating segment data in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear in item of this report 
results of operations summary consolidated net sales increased by million  or  to billion in fiscal this increase in net sales resulted primarily from a million increase in sales in the staffing services segment 
the company s operating segments reported an operating profit in fiscal of million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year  with all four segments reflecting improvements

results of operations by segment staffing services the sales of the staffing services segment increased by million  or  to billion in fiscal  and its operating profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal the sales of the technical placement division of the staffing services segment increased by million  or  to million in fiscal  while its operating profit decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal gross billings in the division increased by million  or  to billion during fiscal due to new procurestaff accounts 
however  substantially all of the procurestaff billings are item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks continued results of operations by segment continued staffing services continued reported on a net basis due to contracts with associate vendors who have agreed to be paid upon receipt of the customers payment to the company 
the sales of vmc consulting project management and consulting increased by million  or  and the net sales of procurestaff increased by million  or 
the decrease in the division s operating profit was due to an increase of overhead expressed as a percentage of sales of percentage point 
the largest increase in overhead costs from the prior year was in procurestaff  whose costs increased by million  or percentage points  due to ongoing development of new products and the implementation of new accounts 
procurestaff incurred an operating loss of million for the year compared to an operating profit of million in the prior year due to these higher costs 
the technical placement division s gross margin percentages remained relatively constant compared to fiscal  with lower markups on traditional staffing placement and higher state unemployment insurance rates  offset by higher margins earned by vmc consulting which  together with a increase in sales  reported a increase in operating profit to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the technical placement division recently lost a managed service contract  the effect of which will be reflected in the first quarter of fiscal revenue and gross profit from this contract approximated each of the division s total revenue and gross profit in both fiscal and the division cannot determine the amount of revenue and gross profit that will be replaced through existing or new customers in the future

although sequential quarterly operating losses have declined during fiscal  cost control initiatives in the division have not fully offset lower gross margins 
while the staffing services segment is committed to continued cost controls designed to increase profitability for fiscal  a return to substantially higher profit levels is likely to depend on the timing and strength of a general economic recovery and more specifically  an increase towards previous usage levels of alternative staffing by industry 
the company expects that high unemployment and the need for state and local governments to align their revenues with expenditures will continue to result in pressures on margins as jurisdictions increase payroll and various other taxes 
although the markets for the segment s services include a broad range of industries throughout the united states and europe  general economic difficulties in specific geographic areas or industrial sectors have in the past  and could in the future  affect the profitability of the segment

due to a change in the publication schedule of the datanational operation s community telephone directories  their sales decreased by million  or  for the year 
the segment s telephone production revenue decreased by million  or  in fiscal primarily due to the previously announced termination of a contract with a telecommunications company in the third quarter of fiscal the segment cannot determine whether current revenue and profits will be replaced through existing or new customers  or increased advertising sales by datanational in the future 
despite the reduced sales  the profitability of the segment increased due to increased productivity  and a reduction in overhead expressed as a percentage of sales of percentage points 
the decreased overhead was predominantly related to a lower bad debt expense as a result of a more stringent credit policy 
operating profit in fiscal also included a million fee due to the terminated contract 
other than the datanational division  which accounted for of the segment s fiscal sales  the segment s business is obtained through submission of competitive proposals for contracts 
these short and long term contracts are re bid after expiration 
while the company has historically secured new contracts and believes it can secure renewals and or extensions of most of these contracts  some of which are material to this segment  and obtain new business  there can be no assurance that contracts will be renewed or extended  or that additional or replacement contracts will be awarded to the company on satisfactory terms

telecommunications services the telecommunications services segment s sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal  and the segment s operating loss was reduced by million  or  from fiscal  to million 
the reduction in the operating loss was due to the sales increase  a percentage point increase in gross margin  together with a reduction in overhead expressed as a percentage of sales of percentage points 
despite an emphasis on cost controls  the results of the segment continue to be affected by the decline in capital spending by telephone companies caused by the depressed conditions within the segment s telecommunications industry customer base 
this factor has also increased competition for available work  pressuring pricing and margins 
following the reorganization of the business operations initiated in fiscal  the segment continued its cost control initiatives in an effort to permit the segment to operate profitably at lower revenue levels without impairing its ability to take advantage of opportunities when the telecommunications industry stabilizes and customers spending increases 
the segment will incur a pre tax charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of costs incurred related to a domestic consulting contract for services
