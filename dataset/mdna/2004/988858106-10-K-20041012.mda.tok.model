table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
for example  unexpected changes in market conditions or a downturn in the economy could adversely affect actual results 
estimates are used in accounting for  among other things  inventory obsolescence  goodwill and long lived asset valuation  lifo inventory retail method  legal liability  credit insurance liability  product warranty  depreciation  employee benefits  tax  and contingencies 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
management believes the following accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
substantially all us inventories represent finished goods which are valued using the last in  first out lifo retail inventory method 
merchandise inventory of peoples jewellers and mappins jewellers of canada is valued using the first in  first out fifo retail inventory method 
under the retail method  inventory is segregated into categories of merchandise with similar characteristics at its current retail selling value 
the determination of inventory at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying an average cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory 
the company is required to determine the lifo cost on an interim basis by estimating annual inflation trends  annual purchases and ending inventory levels for the fiscal year 
actual annual inflation rates and inventory balances as of the end of any fiscal year may differ from interim estimates 
the company applies internally developed indices that the company believes more consistently measure inflation or deflation in the components of its merchandise ie  diamonds  gold and other metals and precious stones and its merchandise mix 
the company believes the internally developed indices more accurately reflect inflation or deflation in its own prices than the us bureau of labor statistics bls producer price indices or other published indices 
the company also writes down its inventory for discontinued  slow moving and damaged inventory 
this write down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions of targeted inventory turn rates  future demand  management strategy  and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or management strategy changes  additional inventory write downs may be required and  in the case of a major change in strategy or downturn in market conditions  such write downs could be significant 
shrinkage is estimated for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal year on a store by store basis 
such estimates are based on experience and the shrinkage results from the last physical inventory 
physical inventories are taken at least once annually for all store locations and for the distribution centers 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is the basis for providing a shrinkage reserve 
long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with their estimated fair values 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow method  using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
assumptions are made with respect to cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets based upon updated projections 
any changes in key assumptions or market conditions could result in an unanticipated impairment charge 
for instance  in the event of a major market downturn  individual stores may become unprofitable  which could result in a write down of the carrying value of the assets located in those stores 
any impairment would be recognized in operating results if a permanent reduction were to occur
