item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk 
further  dell may experience a decrease in revenue from its international operations if it is does not effectively hedge its exposure to currency fluctuations 
dell s continued business success may be largely dependent on its ability to obtain licenses to intellectual property developed by others on commercially reasonable and competitive terms 
if dell or its suppliers are unable to obtain desirable technology licenses  dell could be prohibited from marketing products  could be forced to market products without desirable features or could incur substantial costs to redesign its products  defend legal actions  or pay damages 
dell cannot provide any assurance that current environmental laws  or any laws enacted in the future  will not have a material adverse effect on dell 
dell s operations are subject to environmental regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which dell conducts business 
some of dell s manufacturing operations use substances that are highly regulated in various jurisdictions 
if dell does not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances  dell could be subject to significant liability 
if dfs is unable to provide financing to dell s customers  dell would be forced to find alternative sources for financing for its customers or self finance these activities and  as a result  could experience a decline in its cash flow from operations 
although dell has no economic exposure to the existing assets and liabilities of dfs  should the joint venture experience an interruption in operations  dell would likely have to find alternative sources for future financing arrangements with its customers 
dell is dependent upon dfs to provide financing for a significant number of customers who elect to finance dell products  and dfs is highly dependent upon cit to access the capital markets to provide funding for these transactions 
if cit is unable to access the capital markets  dfs may not be able to fund customer financing arrangements 
upon any such interruption in services  dell would be forced to find alternative sources for financing for its customers or self finance these activities 
dell s alternatives could include negotiating a financing arrangement with another entity or financing customer purchases itself 
absent such an alternative financing arrangement  dell could experience reductions in cash flows due to losses in originations of financing arrangements 
although dell believes that it can find alternative sources for financing for these activities  dell could nonetheless experience a decline in its cash flow from operations if it is unable to do so in a timely manner 
currently  dell does not anticipate any such interruption in dfs operations 
armed hostilities  terrorism or public health issues could have a material adverse effect on dell s business 
armed hostilities  terrorism  or public health issues  whether in the us or abroad  could cause damage or disruption to dell  its suppliers or customers  or could create political or economic instability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on dell s business 
although it is impossible to predict the consequences of any such events  such events could result in a decrease in demand for dell s products  could make it difficult or impossible for dell to deliver products or for its suppliers to deliver components  and could create delay and inefficiencies in dell s supply chain
