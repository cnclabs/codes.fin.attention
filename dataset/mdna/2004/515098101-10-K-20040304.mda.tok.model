item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction landstar system  inc and its subsidiary  landstar system holdings  inc landstar or the company  provide transportation services to a variety of market niches throughout the united states and to a lesser extent in canada and between the united states and canada and mexico through its operating subsidiaries 
landstar s business strategy is to be a non asset based provider of transportation capacity delivering safe  specialized transportation services to a broad range of customers throughout north america utilizing a network of independent commission sales agents and third party capacity providers 
landstar focuses on providing transportation services which emphasize customer service and information 
table of contents coordination among its independent commission sales agents  customers and capacity providers 
the company markets its services primarily through independent commission sales agents and utilizes exclusively third party capacity providers to transport customers freight 
the nature of the company s business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue 
the company has three reportable business segments 
these are the carrier  multimodal and insurance segments 
the carrier segment consists of landstar ranger  inc  landstar inway  inc  landstar ligon  inc  landstar gemini  inc 
and landstar carrier services  inc the carrier segment primarily provides truckload transportation for a wide range of general commodities over irregular routes with its fleet of dry and specialty vans and unsided trailers  including flatbed  drop deck and specialty 
it also provides short to long haul movement of containers by truck  dedicated power only truck capacity and truck brokerage 
the carrier segment markets its services primarily through independent commission sales agents and utilizes independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the company under exclusive lease arrangements the independent contractors and other third party truck capacity providers truck brokerage carriers 
the multimodal segment is comprised of landstar logistics  inc and landstar express america  inc transportation services provided by the multimodal segment include the arrangement of intermodal moves  contract logistics  truck brokerage and emergency and expedited ground and air freight 
the multimodal segment markets its services primarily through independent commission sales agents and utilizes capacity provided by independent contractors and other third party capacity providers  including truck brokerage carriers  railroads and air cargo carriers 
the insurance segment is comprised of signature insurance company signature  a wholly owned offshore insurance subsidiary  and risk management claim services  inc the insurance segment provides risk and claims management services to landstar s operating subsidiaries 
in addition  it reinsures certain property  casualty and occupational accident risks of certain independent contractors who have contracted to haul freight for landstar and provides certain property and casualty insurance directly to landstar s operating subsidiaries 
during the fiscal year ended december   the carrier segment contributed of landstar s consolidated revenue  the multimodal segment contributed of landstar s consolidated revenue and the insurance segment contributed of landstar s consolidated revenue 
changes in financial condition and results of operations the company s success depends on its ability to generate freight through its network of independent commission sales agents and to efficiently deliver that freight utilizing third party capacity providers 
management believes the most significant factors to the company s success include increasing revenue  sourcing capacity and controlling costs 
while customer demand  which is subject to overall economic conditions  ultimately drives increases or decreases in revenue  the company primarily relies on its independent commission sales agents to establish customer relationships and generate revenue opportunities 
management s primary focus with respect to revenue growth is on revenue generated by independent commission sales agents who on an annual basis generate million or more of landstar revenue million dollar agents 
management believes future revenue growth is primarily dependent on its ability to increase both the revenue generated by million dollar agents and the number of million dollar agents through a combination of recruiting new agents and increasing the revenue opportunities generated by existing independent commission sales agents 
the following table shows the number of million dollar agents  the average revenue generated by 
table of contents these agents and the percent of consolidated revenue generated by these agents during the past three fiscal years fiscal year number of million dollar agents average revenue generated per million dollar agent percent of consolidated revenue generated by million dollar agents management monitors business activity by tracking the number of loads volume and revenue per load generated by the carrier and multimodal segments 
in addition  management tracks revenue per revenue mile  average length of haul and total revenue miles at the carrier segment 
revenue per revenue mile and revenue per load collectively  price as well as the number of loads  can be influenced by many factors which do not necessarily indicate a change in price or volume 
those factors include the average length of haul  freight type  special handling and equipment requirements and delivery time requirements 
the following table summarizes this data by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years fiscal year carrier segment number of loads revenue per load revenue per revenue mile average length of haul miles multimodal segment number of loads revenue per load also critical to the company s success is its ability to secure capacity  particularly truck capacity  at rates that allow the company to profitably transport customers freight 
the following table summarizes available truck capacity as of the end of the three most recent fiscal years dec 
 dec 
 dec 
 independent contractors other third party truck capacity providers approved and active other approved total available truck capacity providers number of trucks provided by independent contractors active refers to other third party truck capacity providers who moved at least one load in the days immediately preceding the fiscal year end 
historically  the company s carrier segment has primarily relied on capacity provided by independent contractors 
pursuant to a plan to augment its available capacity and increase its revenue  the company has been increasing the carrier segment s use of capacity provided by other third party truck capacity 
table of contents providers 
the percent of consolidated revenue generated through all truck brokerage carriers was during  during and during the company incurs costs that are directly related to the transportation of freight that include purchased transportation and commissions to agents 
the company incurs indirect costs associated with the transportation of freight that include other operating costs and insurance and claims 
in addition  the company incurs selling  general and administrative costs essential to administering the business operations 
management continually monitors all components of the costs incurred by the company and establishes annual cost budgets which  in general  are used to benchmark costs incurred on a monthly basis 
purchased transportation represents the amount an independent contractor or other third party capacity provider is paid to haul freight 
the amount of purchased transportation paid to an independent contractor is primarily based on a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue generated by the haul 
purchased transportation for the brokerage services operations of the carrier and multimodal segments is based on a negotiated rate for each load hauled 
purchased transportation for the intermodal services operations and the air freight operations of the multimodal segment is based on a contractually agreed upon fixed rate 
purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue for brokerage services and rail intermodal operations is normally higher than that of landstar s other transportation operations 
purchased transportation is the largest component of costs and expenses and  on a consolidated basis  increases or decreases in proportion to the revenue generated through independent contractors  other third party capacity providers and revenue from the insurance segment 
commissions to agents are primarily based on contractually agreed upon percentages of revenue at the carrier segment and of gross profit  defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation  at the multimodal segment 
commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue will vary directly with fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the carrier segment  the multimodal segment and the insurance segment and with changes in gross profit at the multimodal segment 
trailing equipment rent  maintenance costs for trailing equipment  independent contractor recruiting costs and bad debts from independent contractors and independent commission sales agents are the largest components of other operating costs 
potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable 
for commercial trucking claims incurred after june   landstar retains liability up to  per occurrence 
for commercial trucking claims incurred from may  through june   landstar retains liability up to  per occurrence 
for commercial trucking claims incurred prior to may   landstar retains liability up to  per occurrence 
the company also retains liability for each general liability claim up to  and an additional  in excess of the first  effective june    for each workers compensation claim and  for each cargo claim 
the company s exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by other third party capacity providers who haul freight on behalf of the company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which they maintain their own insurance coverage 
while the increase in the company s retention for commercial trucking claims to  per occurrence has enabled the company to manage the cost of its insurance premiums  it also increases the company s risk of liability with respect to individual accidents which  as noted above  can be severe 
employee compensation and benefits account for over half of the company s selling  general and administrative expense 
other significant components of selling  general and administrative expense are communications costs and rent expense 
depreciation and amortization primarily relate to depreciation of trailing equipment and management information services equipment

revenue increased   and  at the carrier  multimodal and insurance segments  respectively 
with respect to the carrier segment  revenue per load increased approximately while the number of loads delivered in remained consistent with the number of loads delivered in the average length of haul per load at the carrier segment increased approximately and revenue per revenue mile increased approximately 
at the multimodal segment  the number of loads delivered in decreased approximately compared to  however average revenue per load increased approximately 
the increase in average revenue per load was primarily attributable to an increase in the average size of air expedited shipments  increased rates charged for expedited shipments and an increased length of haul 
investment income at the insurance segment was  and  for fiscal year and  respectively 
the decrease in investment income was primarily due to a reduced rate of return  attributable to a general decline in interest rates  on investments held by the insurance segment 
purchased transportation was of revenue in compared with in the increase in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to increased brokerage revenue at the carrier segment  increased brokerage and rail intermodal revenue at the multimodal segment and increased rates charged by truck brokerage carriers  partially offset by an increased use of company provided trailing equipment versus trailing equipment provided by independent contractors

excluding these costs  selling  general and administrative costs were of revenue in the decrease in selling  general and administrative costs  excluding the costs of the gulf bridge roro  inc litigation  as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decreased provision for bonuses under the company s incentive compensation plans  decreased communications costs and a decreased provision for customer bad debts  attributable to an improving economic environment  partially offset by increased administrative costs for independent contractor programs at the insurance segment 
depreciation and amortization was of revenue in and of revenue in the increase in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to increased depreciation expense for company owned trailing equipment as the average number of company owned trailers increased during interest and debt expense was of revenue in and of revenue in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates and reduced average borrowings on the company s senior credit facility

at december   the valuation allowance of  was attributable to deferred state income tax benefits  which primarily represented state operating loss carryforwards at one subsidiary 
the valuation allowance and goodwill will be reduced by  when realization of deferred state income tax benefits becomes likely 
the company believes that deferred income tax benefits  net of the valuation allowance  are more likely than not to be realized because of the company s ability to generate future taxable earnings

the decrease in investment income was primarily due to a reduced rate of return  attributable to a general decline in interest rates  on investments held by the insurance segment 

table of contents purchased transportation was of revenue in compared with in the increase in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to increased brokerage revenue at the carrier segment and increased rail intermodal revenue at the multimodal segment 
commissions to agents were of revenue in both and  as increased agent commissions at the multimodal segment were offset by reduced agent commissions on brokerage revenue at the carrier segment and the effect of increased premium revenue at the insurance segment 
other operating costs were of revenue in both and  as increased trailer maintenance costs were offset by reductions in independent contractor recruiting  qualification and incentive costs and reduced net costs of plates and permits 
insurance and claims were of revenue in compared with in the increase in insurance and claims as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to increased commercial trucking claims in the million excess of million layer and increased unladen truckers liability claims due to an increase in the level of risk assumed by signature under the company s unladen truckers liability program effective january  these increases were partially offset by a reduction in insurance claims resulting from increased revenue hauled by other third party capacity providers 
selling  general and administrative costs were of revenue in and in the decrease in selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to decreased wages  travel and entertainment expenses and communication costs  as a result of certain cost reduction initiatives  and a decreased provision for customer bad debt  attributable to an improving economic environment  partially offset by an increased provision for bonuses under the company s incentive compensation plans  increased costs for the company s employee benefit programs and increased legal fees 
depreciation and amortization was of revenue in and of revenue in the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the january  implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

on december   landstar renegotiated its existing credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and jpmorgan chase bank  as administrative agent the third amended and restated credit agreement 
the third amended and restated credit agreement provides  of borrowing capacity in the form of a revolving credit facility   of which may be utilized in the form of letter of credit guarantees 
at december   the company had  in borrowings outstanding and  of letters of credit outstanding on its third amended and restated credit agreement 
at december   there was  available for future borrowings under the company s third amended and restated credit agreement 
in addition  the company has  in letters of credit outstanding  as collateral for insurance claims  that are secured by investments and cash equivalents totaling borrowings under the third amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at rates equal to  at the option of landstar  either i the greatest of a the prime rate as publicly announced from time to time by jpmorgan chase bank  b the three month cd rate adjusted for statutory reserves and fdic assessment costs plus and c the federal funds effective rate plus  or  ii the rate at the time offered to jpmorgan chase bank in the eurodollar market for amounts and periods comparable to the relevant loan plus a margin that is determined based on the level of the company s leverage ratio  as defined in the third amended and restated credit agreement 
the margin is subject to an increase of

the third amended and restated credit agreement contains a number of covenants that limit  among other things  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  the incurrence of operating or capital lease obligations and the purchase of operating property 
the third amended and restated credit agreement also requires landstar to meet certain financial tests 
landstar is required to  among other things  maintain minimum levels of net worth  as defined in the third amended and restated credit agreement  and interest and fixed charge coverages  as therein defined 
under the most restrictive covenant  interest

borrowings under the third amended and restated credit agreement are unsecured 
however  landstar system  inc and all but one of landstar system holdings  inc s lshi subsidiaries guarantee lshi s obligations under the third amended and restated credit agreement 
the company s third amended and restated credit agreement expires on january  the company expects to obtain financing to renew or replace the third amended and restated credit agreement with a similar agreement during the summer of with interest rates and fees in line with the market rates and fees available at the time of the refinancing 
historically  the company has generated sufficient operating cash flow to meet its debt service requirements  fund continued growth  both internal and through acquisitions and to meet working capital needs 
as a non asset based provider of transportation capacity  the company s annual capital requirements for operating property are generally for trailers and management information services equipment 
in addition  a significant portion of the trailing equipment used by the company is provided by third party capacity providers and through leases at rental rates that vary with the revenue generated through the use of the leased equipment  thereby reducing the company s capital requirements 
during  the company purchased  of operating property and acquired  of trailing equipment by entering into a five year operating lease with a fixed monthly payment 
landstar anticipates acquiring between  and  of operating property during fiscal year either by purchase or by lease financing 
prior to  the company historically funded its acquisition of company provided fixed cost trailing equipment using capital leases 
during  the company acquired van trailing equipment under a long term operating lease at a fixed monthly rental price per trailer 
it is expected that capital leases will fund any significant trailer purchases of owned equipment made during the company does not anticipate any other significant capital requirements in the near future 
since  the company has purchased  of its common stock under programs authorized by the board of directors of the company in open market and private block transactions 
the company has used cash provided by operating activities and borrowings on the company s revolving credit facilities to fund the purchases 
contractual obligations and commitments at december   the company s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligation total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations above include  of imputed interest 
operating leases primarily include  related to the company s main office facility located in jacksonville  florida and  related to a long term operating lease for trailing equipment 
the company has a commitment to enter into additional operating leases for trailing equipment during the first half of the year with aggregate future rental payments estimated to be  annually over the next five years

legal matters on november   the owner operator independent drivers association  inc ooida and six individual independent contractors filed a putative class action suit in the federal district court in jacksonville  florida  against the company 
the suit alleges that certain aspects of the company s motor carrier leases with owner operators violate the federal leasing regulations 
ooida seeks injunctive relief  an unspecified amount of damages and attorney s fees 
on december   the company filed a motion to dismiss and  with respect to all of the leases that contain arbitration clauses  a motion to stay and compel arbitration 
on september   the federal district court issued an order denying the company s motion to stay and compel arbitration 
the company initially appealed this decision but  due to recent relevant legal developments  has filed a motion seeking to dismiss the appeal 
assuming the motion to dismiss the appeal is granted  the case will proceed in the federal district court rather than in arbitration 
at the request of the company  the district court has granted a stay with respect to all proceedings in its court related to the claims of all plaintiffs except one plaintiff whose claims were not subject to the arbitration motion because his lease lacked an arbitration clause pending disposition of the appeal 
the federal district court has yet to issue a ruling on landstar s motion to dismiss or on the issue of class certification 
due to a number of factors  including the lack of specificity in the plaintiff s complaint  the early stage of this litigation and the lack of litigated final judgments in a number of similar pending cases or otherwise applicable precedent  landstar does not believe it is in a position to conclude whether or not there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse outcome in this case  or what damages  if any  the plaintiffs would be awarded should they prevail on all or any part of their claims 
however  landstar believes it has meritorious defenses to this litigation and intends to continue defending it vigorously 
landstar also believes that it treats its independent contractors fairly and in a manner which reflects the important role they play in the company s operations 
the company is involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business 
based on knowledge of the facts and  in certain cases  opinions of outside counsel  management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such other claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome  after provisions thereof  will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company  but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts for both trade and other receivables represents management s estimate of the amount of outstanding receivables that will not be collected 
during fiscal years and  the company experienced abnormally high levels of bad debt expense 
management believes this resulted from the difficult economic environment experienced by the company s customers and independent contractors 
historically  management s estimates for uncollectible receivables have been materially correct 
although management believes the amount of the allowance for both trade and other receivables at december  is appropriate  a prolonged period of low or no economic growth may adversely affect the collection of these receivables 
conversely  a more robust economic environment may result in the realization of some portion of the estimated uncollectible receivables 
landstar provides for the estimated costs of self insured claims primarily on an actuarial basis 
the amount recorded for the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the balance sheet date 
the ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by management 
historically  the company has experienced both favorable 
table of contents and unfavorable development of prior year claims estimates 
the company is continually revising its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim 
during fiscal year  insurance and claims costs included  of unfavorable adjustments to prior year claims estimates 
during fiscal years and  insurance and claims costs included  and  respectively  of favorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate outcome of settling all outstanding claims will be more or less than the estimated liability for claims at december  the company utilizes certain income tax planning strategies to reduce its overall cost of income taxes 
upon audit  it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
the company has provided for its estimated exposure attributable to income tax planning strategies 
management believes that the provision for liabilities resulting from the implementation of income tax planning strategies is appropriate 
to date  the company has not experienced an examination by governmental revenue authorities that would lead management to believe that the company s past provisions for exposures related to income tax planning strategies are not appropriate 
significant variances from management s estimates for the amount of uncollectible receivables  the ultimate resolution of claims or the provision for liabilities for income tax planning strategies can be expected to positively or negatively affect landstar s earnings in a given quarter or year 
however  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these items  given a range of reasonably likely outcomes  will not significantly affect the long term financial condition of landstar or its ability to fund its continuing operations 
effects of inflation management does not believe inflation has had a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of landstar in the past five years 
however  inflation higher than that experienced in the past five years might have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
seasonality landstar s operations are subject to seasonal trends common to the trucking industry 
results of operations for the quarter ending in march are typically lower than the quarters ending june  september and december 
subsequent event on december   a truck operated by an independent contractor was involved in a serious accident resulting in fatalities 
management is still in the process of obtaining the facts concerning this incident and evaluating the potential financial cost of this claim to the company 
while management s evaluation is preliminary  and investigation continues  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of this claim could result in a charge ranging anywhere from  up to an amount equal to the company s  self insured retention amount 
a  pre tax charge would reduce earnings for the fiscal quarter ended march  and full year by approximately 
per diluted share

these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results or events to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated 
investors should not place undue reliance on such forward looking statements  and the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
factors that may affect future results and or forward looking statements increased severity or frequency of accidents and other claims 
as noted above in item  business factors significant to the company s operations insurance and claims  potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable 
landstar retains liability for each individual commercial trucking claim up to  per occurrence 
the company also retains liability up to  and an additional  in excess of the first  for each general liability claim   for each workers compensation claim  and  for each cargo claim 
a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents  cargo or workers compensation claims or the unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on landstar  including its results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on third party insurance companies 
the company is dependent on a limited number of third party insurance companies to provide insurance coverage in excess of its self insured retention amounts 
historically  the company has relied on various third party insurance companies to provide insurance coverage for commercial trucking claims in excess of specific per occurrence limits 
over the past two years  the premiums proposed by the third party insurance companies coverage for commercial trucking liability insurance above the company s self insured retention amounts have increased dramatically 
in an attempt to control the increasing premiums required by the third party insurance companies  the company has increased its exposure on commercial trucking claims over the past three years from  per occurrence to  per occurrence 
while the increase in the company s retention for commercial trucking claims to  per occurrence has enabled the company to manage the cost of its insurance premiums  it also increases the company s risk of liability with respect to individual accidents which can be severe 
to the extent the third party insurance companies continue to increase proposed premiums for coverage of commercial trucking liability claims  the company may further increase its exposure on a per occurrence basis in the near future 
however  to the extent the third party insurance carriers reduce their premiums proposed for commercial trucking claim coverage  the company may reduce its exposure on a per occurrence basis 
dependence on independent commission sales agents 
as noted above in item  business factors significant to the company s operations agent network  the company markets its services primarily through independent commission sales agents  and currently has a network of over such agents 
during  agents generated revenue for landstar of at least million each  or approximately of landstar s consolidated revenue and one agent generated approximately  of landstar s total revenue 
although the company competes with motor carriers and other third parties for the services of these independent commission sales agents  landstar has historically experienced very limited agent turnover among its larger volume agents 
however  landstar s contracts with its agents are typically terminable upon to days notice by either party and do not restrict the ability of a former agent to compete with landstar following any such termination 
the loss of some of the company s key agents or a significant decrease in volume generated by landstar s larger agents could have a material adverse effect on landstar  including its results of operations and revenue 
dependence on third party capacity providers 
as noted above in item  business factors significant to the company s operations capacity  landstar does not own trucks or other transportation equipment other than trailing equipment and relies on third party capacity providers  including independent contractors  unrelated trucking companies  railroads and air cargo carriers to 
table of contents transport freight for its customers 
the company competes with motor carriers and other third parties for the services of independent contractors and other third party capacity providers 
a significant decrease in available capacity provided by either the company s independent contractors or other third party capacity providers could have a material adverse effect on landstar  including its results of operations and revenue 
change in capacity mix 
historically  the company s carrier segment has primarily relied on capacity provided by independent contractors 
pursuant to a plan to augment its available capacity and increase its revenue  the company has been increasing the carrier segment s use of capacity provided by other third party truck capacity providers 
freight hauled by independent contractors represented  and of landstar s consolidated revenue in  and  respectively 
historically  with the exception of air revenue  the net margin defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation and agent commissions generated from freight hauled by independent contractors has been greater than freight hauled by other third party capacity providers 
an increase in the amount of revenue generated through other third party capacity providers without an increase in total revenue and or a corresponding reduction in other costs  including other operating  insurance and claims  selling  general and administrative and depreciation and amortization could have a negative effect on the company s operating margin defined as operating income divided by revenue 
decreased demand for transportation services 
the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical financial results as a result of slowdowns in economic activity  the business cycles of customers  price increases by capacity providers  interest rate fluctuations  and other economic factors beyond landstar s control 
certain of the company s third party capacity providers can be expected to charge higher prices to cover increased operating expenses  and the company s operating income may decline if it is unable to pass through to its customers the full amount of such higher transportation costs 
if a slowdown in economic activity or a downturn in the company s customers business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
substantial industry competition 
as noted above in item  business factors significant to the company s operations competition  landstar competes primarily in the transportation services industry 
the transportation services industry is extremely competitive and fragmented 
landstar competes primarily with truckload carriers  intermodal transportation service providers  railroads  less than truckload carriers  third party broker carriers and other non asset based transportation service providers 
management believes that competition for the freight transported by the company is based primarily on service and efficiency and  to a lesser degree  on freight rates alone 
historically  competition has created downward pressure on freight rates 
a decrease in freight rates could have a material adverse effect on landstar  including its revenue and operating income 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is dependent on the services of its executive officers 
although the company believes it has an experienced and highly qualified management group  the loss of the services of the company s executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company 
disruptions or failures in the company s computer systems 
as noted above in item  business factors significant to the company s operations technology  the company s information technology systems used in connection with its operations are located in jacksonville  florida and to a lesser extent in rockford  illinois 
landstar relies in the regular course of its business on the proper operation of its information technology systems to link its extensive network of customers  agents and third party capacity providers  including its independent contractors 
any significant disruption or failure of its technology systems could significantly disrupt the company s operations and impose significant costs on the company 
potential changes in fuel taxes 
from time to time  various legislative proposals are introduced to increase federal  state  or local taxes  including taxes on motor fuels 
the company cannot predict whether  or in what form  any increase in such taxes applicable to the transportation services provided by the company will be enacted and  if enacted  whether or not the company s independent contractors and other third party truck capacity providers would attempt to pass the increase onto the company or if the company will be able to reflect this potential increased cost of capacity  if any  in prices to customers 

table of contents any such increase in fuel taxes could have a material adverse effect on landstar  including its results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  competition from other transportation service companies including those that provide non trucking modes of transportation and intermodal transportation would likely increase if state or federal taxes on fuel were to increase without a corresponding increase in taxes imposed upon other modes of transportation 
status of independent contractors 
from time to time  various legislative or regulatory proposals are introduced at the federal or state levels to change the status of independent contractors classification to employees for either employment tax purposes withholding  social security  medicare and unemployment taxes or other benefits available to employees 
currently  most individuals are classified as employees or independent contractors for employment tax purposes based on common law factors rather than any definition found in the internal revenue code or internal revenue service regulations 
in addition  under section of the revenue act of  taxpayers that meet certain criteria may treat an individual as an independent contractor for employment tax purposes if they have been audited without being told to treat similarly situated workers as employees  if they have received a ruling from the internal revenue service or a court decision affirming their treatment  or if they are following a long standing recognized practice 
the company classifies all of its independent contractors and independent commission sales agents as independent contractors for all purposes  including employment tax and employee benefit purposes 
although management is unaware of any proposals currently pending that would change the employee independent contractor classification of independent contractors currently doing business with the company  the costs associated with potential changes  if any  in the employee independent contractor classification could have a material adverse effect on landstar  including its results of operations and financial condition if landstar were unable to reflect them in its fee arrangements with the independent contractors and agents or in the prices charged to its customers 
regulatory and legislative changes 
as noted above in item  business factors significant to the company s operations regulation  each of the operating subsidiaries is a motor carrier which is regulated by the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and by various state agencies 
the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes such as increasingly stringent environmental and or safety security regulations or limits on vehicle weight and size that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services 
any such regulatory or legislative changes could have a material adverse effect on landstar  including its results of operations and financial condition 
effective january   the fmcsa has revised its regulations modifying its hours of service rules 
the new regulations primarily change the amount of time a truck driver may drive and or work during a hour period 
these new regulations also change the amount of time a truck driver is required to rest 
management has implemented programs to inform the company s independent contractors and customers of the new hours of service regulations 
management does not believe compliance with these regulations will have a material effect on the company s results of operations

as of december   the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding was 
during fiscal  the average outstanding balance under the third amended and restated credit agreement was approximately  based on the borrowing rates in the third amended and restated credit agreement and the repayment terms  the fair value of the outstanding borrowings as of december  was estimated to approximate carrying value

the company s obligations under the third amended and restated credit agreement are guaranteed by all but one of lshi s subsidiaries 
long term investments consist of investment grade bonds having maturities of up to five years

short term investments consist of short term investment grade instruments and the current maturities of investment grade bonds 
accordingly  there is no material future interest rate risk associated with these short term investments
