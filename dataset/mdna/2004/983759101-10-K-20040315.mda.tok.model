item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 
this discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f of this report 
this annual report on form k is filed by xm satellite radio holdings inc xm 
xm satellite radio inc inc 
is filing separately 
the principal differences between the financial condition of xm and inc  which are not significant in amount  are the ownership by xm of the corporate headquarters building since august  and the lease of the building from xm by inc  the presence at xm of additional indebtedness not guaranteed by inc  and the existence of cash balances at xm 
accordingly  the results of operations for inc and its subsidiaries are substantially the same as the results for xm and its subsidiaries discussed above except that inc incurs additional rent  less depreciation and amortization expense and less other income  in each case principally related to inc s rental of its corporate headquarters from xm  which are intercompany transactions that have been eliminated in the xm financial statements  less interest expense principally related to the additional indebtedness at xm  and less interest income because of the additional cash balances at xm 
overview our highlights include the following growing the xm business to over million subscribers at year end  including over million new subscribers added during the year  the continued introduction of innovative retail products at attractive price points and broad oem factory installed penetration across numerous vehicle models  ending with a recurring subscription revenue run rate of million  and achieving a positive gross margin calculated as revenues less variable costs  which include revenue share royalties  customer care billing  cost of equipment and ad sales during while containing our fixed costs and reducing our costs to acquire each new subscriber 
the key metrics we use to monitor our business growth and our operational results are ending subscribers  average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber arpu  subscriber acquisition cost sac  cost per gross addition cpga and ebitda  presented as follows years ended december  net subscriber additions aftermarket  oem other subscribers subscribers in oem promotional periods xm activated vehicles with rental car companies total ending subscribers average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber average monthly subscription revenue per aftermarket  oem other subscriber average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber in oem promotional periods average monthly subscription revenue per xm activated vehicle with rental car companies subscriber acquisition costs sac cost per gross addition cpga ebitda in thousands oem promotional periods typically range from three months to one year in duration and are paid for by the vehicle manufacturers

in  we raised net proceeds of million 
this includes million of net funds raised in the january financing transactions  million of net funds raised in june including million raised in july from the exercise of an over allotment option  million of net funds raised in september  and million of net funds raised through the direct stock purchase program in in january  we also raised million of net funds 
the january financing transactions also included million of payment deferrals and a line of credit 
the proceeds received have been used to acquire our dars license  make required payments for our system  including the satellites  terrestrial repeater system  and ground networks  and for working capital and operating expenses 
provided that we meet the revenue  expense and cash flow projections of our business plan  we expect to be fully funded with no need to raise additional financing to continue operations 
from january  to december   we eliminated million carrying value of indebtedness  or approximately million face value at maturity  through the issuance of million shares of class a common stock and million of cash 
these transactions also eliminated approximately million in future interest  dividends  accretion and principal payments as well as million shares of incremental dilution 
we will continue to incur operating losses until we substantially increase the number of our subscribers and develop a stream of cash flow sufficient to cover operating costs 
we are focused on managing growth and containing costs while increasing subscribers and scaling processes 
we also have significant outstanding contracts and commercial commitments that need to be paid in cash or through credit facilities over the next several years  including to fund subsidies and distribution costs  particularly under our arrangement with general motors  programming costs  repayment of long term debt  lease payments and service payments  as further described below under the heading liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
our ability to become profitable also depends upon other factors identified below under the heading liquidity and capital resources future operating and capital resource requirements 
inc was incorporated in delaware in and xm became a holding company in early we emerged from the development stage in the fourth quarter of  following the commencement of our service in two test markets on september  and nationwide launch on november  accordingly  the results for the years ended december  and reflect limited commercial operations and the direct comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december   and and for the years ended december  and may not be meaningful with respect to revenue and various other line items 
results of operations to explain our performance  we discuss our results of operations using the following revenue and expense categories that reflect the drivers of the business 
subscription revenue subscription includes fees from basic and premium service net of subscription related promotions 
activation revenue activation includes amortization of subscription activation fees over the estimated average life of a subscriber 
equipment revenue equipment includes revenue from xm s direct sales of radios and other related equipment 
net ad sales revenue net ad sales includes revenue from sales of advertisements and programming sponsorships to advertisers on the xm radio network  net of agency commissions 
cost of revenue costs of revenue are those expenses directly related to the generation of subscriber and advertising revenue and have variable and fixed components 
cost of equipment  revenue share royalties  along with customer care billing tend to fluctuate along with increases and decreases in revenues and or subscribers 
ad sales  which includes internal and external costs directly associated with selling advertisements on the xm network  tends to fluctuate with increases and decreases in advertising revenue 
satellite terrestrial  broadcast operations and programming content are not expected to fluctuate directly with changes in revenue and or subscribers 
research development research development is a discretionary expense used primarily to drive new product development and radio component and radio unit cost reductions 
general administrative general administrative expenses include legal  human resources  accounting and other overhead costs 
marketing marketing includes retention support  which are those indirect costs  primarily labor  that are not associated with gaining a subscriber and are not expected to fluctuate directly with changes in revenue and or subscribers  subsidies distribution  which includes commissions to radio manufacturers and distribution partners that are based on the number of radios or vehicles manufactured or the number of new subscribers added in the period  marketing  which are those discretionary costs including advertising  media and events  as well as marketing materials for retail and automotive dealer points of presence 
amortization of the gm liability includes the straight line accounting treatment of the fixed obligation to general motors 
we consider subscriber acquisition costs sac to include radio manufacturer subsidies  certain sales  activation and installation commissions  and hardware related promotions 
these costs are reported in subsidies distribution on the consolidated statement of operations 
subscriber acquisition costs also include the negative margins on equipment sales 
subscriber acquisition costs do not include ongoing loyalty payments to retailers and distribution partners  payments under revenue sharing arrangements with radio manufacturers and distributors and the amortization of the gm liability 
we consider cost per gross addition cpga to include the amounts in sac  as well as advertising  media and marketing expenses except for retention and support and the amortization of the gm liability 
ebitda net loss before interest income  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization is commonly referred to in our business as ebitda 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
consistent with regulatory requirements  ebitda includes other income expense 
we believe editda is often a useful measure of a company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by our management to measure the operating performance of our business 
because we have funded and completed the build out of our system through the raising and expenditure of large amounts of capital  our results of operations reflect significant charges for depreciation  amortization and interest expense 
ebitda  which excludes this information  provides helpful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from the expenses associated with our physical plant or capital structure 
ebitda is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in our industry  although our measure of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

radios that are revenue generating are counted individually as subscribers 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  xm satellite radio holdings inc and subsidiaries revenue revenue 
our revenue consists of subscription fees  activation charges  limited direct sales of radios  advertising sales  and revenue earned from royalties and invoice fees 
in  we recognized million in total revenue  compared to million in  an increase of million

subscribers 
as of december   we had  subscribers  compared to  at december   an increase of  subscribers 
our subscribers include  self paying subscribers   subscribers in oem promotional periods typically ranging from three months to one year in duration paid for by the vehicle manufacturers and  xm activated vehicles with rental car companies 
at the time of sale  vehicle owners generally receive a month trial subscription and are included in oem promotional subscribers 
xm generally receives two months of the month trial subscription from the vehicle manufacturer 
the number of subscribers electing to continue with the xm service beyond the initial oem promotional period  the conversion rate  has ranged from through the end of and averaged approximately for beginning in late september  we began an interim auto activation program whereby xm enabled radios in new vehicles manufactured by general motors and honda are automatically activated to receive the xm service as a subscriber at the time of the sale to the vehicle purchaser 
in march  we began a fully automated factory activation program whereby xm enabled radios in new vehicles manufactured by general motors are activated to receive the xm service at the time of manufacture 
these vehicles are not included in our subscriber count until the vehicle is sold to a customer who becomes an oem promotional subscriber 
the fully automated factory activation program was initiated to streamline the process for activating the xm service in vehicles that previously required the auto manufacturers dealers to contact our listener care center 
the fully automated factory activation program also provides activated radios on the dealer lots for test drives 
in addition  gm will now provide standard on the window sticker months free of xm service with every xm enabled vehicle 
we cannot predict how the change to this auto activation program will impact our overall conversion rate 
however  we expect that the implementation of the fully automated factory activation program will increase the number of subscribers provided by our oem distribution channel  but will result in a decline in our overall conversion rate due to a larger number of cars activated for trial service 
our subscribers also include  xm activated vehicles with rental car companies 
for the initial model year xm enabled rental vehicles  xm receives payments based on the use of xm service 
customers are charged per day per vehicle for use of the xm service  on which xm receives a revenue share

arpu from our oem promotional subscribers was during  compared to during the oem promotional programs began in november arpu from our rental car fleet subscribers was during arpu from our family plan subscribers was during average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber is derived from the total of earned subscription revenue net of promotions and rebates divided by the monthly weighted average number of subscribers for the period reported 
average monthly revenue per subscriber is a measure of operational performance and not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
average monthly revenue per subscriber will fluctuate based on promotions implemented in  as well as the adoption rate of multiyear prepayment plans  multitradio discount plans such as the family plan  premium and data services 
activation revenue 
activation revenue is comprised of one time activation charges billed to customers 
activation fees are non refundable  and are recognized on a pro rata basis over the estimated month life of the subscriber relationship 
we expect this estimate to be further refined in the future as additional historical data becomes available 
during  we recognized million in activation revenue compared to million in  an increase of million due to an increase in subscribers 
the growth in activation revenue will be impacted by the amount of discounts given as a result of the competitive environment 
equipment revenue 
equipment revenue is comprised of revenues from any direct sales of radios 
through december   the direct sales of radios have generally been for promotional purposes 
during  we recognized million in equipment revenue compared to million during for  equipment revenue included million from direct sales of radios to related parties compared with  in we expect revenue from the sale of equipment to increase proportionately with the increase in direct sales of equipment by xm 
net ad sales revenue 
advertising revenue consists of sales of advertisements and program sponsorships on the xm network to advertisers that are recognized in the period in which they are broadcast 
advertising revenue includes advertising aired in exchange for goods and services barter  which is recorded at fair value

advertising sales on these channels is expected to offset the forgone revenue from the implementation of our commercial free music format that began february  other revenue 
other revenue earned during consists of processing fees charged to invoiced subscribers  royalty revenue from certain tuners manufactured  and other revenue 
we recognized million of other revenue during compared with million during we expect other revenue to increase during operating expenses total operating expenses 
total operating expenses were million for compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase was due primarily to an increase in cost of revenue of million attributable to increased sales  an increase in marketing expenses of million due to increased distribution expenses as a result of the growth in subscribers and an increase in depreciation and amortization of million resulting from a reduction in the useful life of our satellites in third quarter of  offset in part by an impairment charge of million relating to goodwill recognized in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes revenue share royalties  customer care billing costs  costs of radios associated with direct sales of radios  costs directly associated with sales of advertising  satellite terrestrial operating costs  as well as costs related to broadcast operations and programming content 
these combined costs were million for  up from million in  an increase of million or 
revenue share royalties 
revenue share royalties includes performance rights obligations to composers  artists  and copyright owners for public performances of their creative works broadcast on xm  and royalties paid to radio technology providers and revenue share payments to manufacturing and distribution partners and content providers 
these costs were million in compared to million in this increase of million was a result of our growth in subscriber base and revenues along with completion of negotiations for performance rights royalties

customer care billing operations expense includes expenses from outsourced customer care functions as well as internal it costs associated with front office applications 
these expenses were million during  compared with million during  an increase of million

during  we incurred million relating to promotional radios and radio kits that we sold directly to subscribers  compared to million in we expect the cost of equipment to increase during as we increase direct sales of equipment 
ad sales 
ad sales expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in ad sales expense is due primarily to an increase in staffing and marketing costs to support ad sales growth 
we expect ad sales costs to increase in in support of advertising revenue growth 
satellite terrestrial 
satellite terrestrial includes telemetry  tracking and control of our two satellites  in orbit satellite insurance and incentive payments  satellite uplink  and all costs associated with operating our terrestrial repeater network such as power  maintenance and lease payments 
these expenses were million in  compared with million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease primarily resulted from previously accrued performance incentives payable to boeing relating to xm rock and xm roll that were reversed in as a result of the december amendment of our contract with boeing  which removed this obligation 
we expect system operating costs in to be in line with the costs incurred in broadcast operations broadcast 
broadcast expenses include costs associated with the management and maintenance of the systems  software  hardware  production and performance studios used in the creation and distribution of xm original and third party content 
the advertising trafficking scheduling and insertion functions are also included

operations 
operations  which includes facilities and back office information technology expense  was million in  compared with million in  a decrease of million 
these costs are expected to remain stable in programming content 
programming content includes the creative and production costs associated with our channels of xm original and third party content 
this includes costs of programming staff and fixed payments for third party content 
programming content expense was million during  compared with million during  a decrease of million or 
the decrease is due primarily to decreases in payroll and payroll related costs from a reduction in headcount which occurred in november and lower fixed payments to certain content providers as a result of contract renegotiations 
these costs are expected to increase in as we make changes to our channel line up and enhance our programming 
in  we expect to launch instant traffic and weather channels  each dedicated to the traffic and weather of a specific market 
research development 
research development includes the costs of new product development  chipset design  and engineering 
these combined expenses were million in  compared with million in  an increase of million or

the increase in general administrative expense primarily resulted from an increase in director and officer insurance premiums  and an increase in non cash stock based compensation charges  offset in part by a decrease in costs incurred for professional services 
we expect general and administrative expense to increase slightly during marketing 
marketing includes the costs of retention support  subsidies distribution  advertising marketing  and amortization of our liability to gm 
these combined costs were million for  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
marketing expense increased primarily due to increases in subsidies distribution of million and amortization of gm liability of million  offset in part by decreases in retention and support of million and advertising and marketing of million 
retention support 
personnel related expenses comprise the majority of retention and support 
in  these costs were million compared to million in  a decrease of million or  primarily due to a reduction in staffing levels  and a decrease in non cash stock compensation expense resulting from the reversal of an accrual relating to the sony warrants 
in september  it was evident that sony did not achieve the minimum performance target required for the vesting of its warrants 
therefore  the non cash compensation charges of million recorded in prior years in relation to these warrants were reversed in subsidies distribution 
we currently provide incentives and subsidies for the manufacture  purchase  installation and activation of xm radios to attract and retain our manufacturing and distribution partners 
our subsidy and distribution costs are significant and totaled approximately million during  compared with million during  an increase of million or 
this increase is due primarily to the increase in subscribers  new activations  and gm vehicles equipped with xm radios  offset in part by a decrease in manufacturing subsidies resulting from changes in the subsidy timing and lower subsidy rates 
subsidy and distribution expense will increase as the number of xm radios that are manufactured  installed and activated increase  however  we expect the cost per new subscriber to decrease 
subscriber acquisition costs 
we consider subscriber acquisition costs to include radio manufacturer subsidies  certain sales  activation and installation commissions  and hardware related promotions 
these costs are reported in subsidies distribution 
the negative margins from equipment sales are also included in subscriber acquisition costs 
subscriber acquisition costs do not include ongoing loyalty payments to retailers and distribution partners  payments under revenue sharing arrangements with radio manufacturers and distributors and certain guaranteed payments to general motors 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred expenses of million  and million  respectively  related to subscriber acquisition costs 
our average subscriber acquisition cost was and during and  respectively 
the decline in sac for as compared to is due primarily to the decline in manufacturer subsidies 
we expect sac to decline in advertising marketing 
activities comprising these expenses include media  advertising  events and direct marketing programs 
advertising marketing costs were million during  compared with million during  a decrease of million or 
the decrease is due primarily to our decreased purchase of consumer advertising media 
we expect these expenses to increase during cost per gross addition 
we consider cpga to include the amounts in sac  as well as advertising  media and other discretionary marketing expenses 
in our financial statements  sac costs are captured in subsidies distribution and the negative margins from equipment sales  while cpga costs are primarily captured by the combination of subsidies distribution  advertising marketing  plus the negative margins from equipment sales 
cpga does not include marketing staff included in retention support or the amortization of the gm guaranteed payments included in amortization of gm liability 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred cpga expenses of million  and million  respectively 
cpga for and was and  respectively 
the decline in cpga for as compared to is due to the combined impacts of the declines in manufacturer subsidies  discretionary advertising and marketing expenses and an increase in the number of activations 
we expect cpga to decline in amortization of gm liability 
these costs include the amortization of annual fixed guaranteed payment commitments to general motors  aggregating to million  under our long term distribution agreement with the onstar division of gm providing for the installation of xm radios in gm vehicles 
amortization of the gm liability was million for  compared with million for the distribution agreement was amended in june and then again in january  as described under the captions liquidity and capital resources capital resources and financing

we expect these expenses to increase to million in and to remain at million per annum through september impairment of goodwill 
we recognized an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of depreciation amortization 
depreciation amortization expense was million during  compared with million during  an increase of million or 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulted from the reduction in the useful lives of our in orbit satellites from years to years during the third quarter of due to a solar array output power anomaly

we made two changes to our calculation of arpu at the end of in an effort to provide a metric that we feel is more reflective of our earned recurring monthly subscription revenue 
first  we no longer include earned activation revenue as part of the arpu calculation 
we also refined our methodology to calculate arpu using a denominator of monthly weighted average customers rather than our previous approach of daily weighted average customers to be consistent with how we manage our business

these expenses were million in  compared with million in  a decrease of million or 
this decrease primarily resulted from a charge of million in compared to a charge of million in related to terrestrial repeater sites no longer required 
exclusive of this charge  we incurred increased operating expenses in compared to as our satellites and terrestrial repeater network performed over a first full year of operations 
broadcast operations broadcast 
broadcast expenses include costs associated with the management and maintenance of the systems  software  hardware  production and performance studios used in the creation and distribution of xm original and third party content 
the advertising trafficking scheduling and insertion functions are also included 
broadcast costs were million for  compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase reflects a full year of operations for operations 
operations  which includes facilities and information technology expense  was million in  compared with million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in operations expense in is attributed to a decrease in rent expense which was a direct result of the purchase of our corporate headquarters in the third quarter of and a decrease in costs incurred for professional services related to information technology as a result of a decreased need for post implementation support 
programming content 
programming content includes the creative and production costs associated with our channels of xm original and third party content 
this includes costs of programming staff and fixed payments for third party content 
programming content expense was million during  compared with million during  an increase of million or 
the increase reflects a full year of operations for research development 
research development includes the costs of new product development  chipset design  and engineering 
these combined expenses were million in  compared with million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in research and development expense primarily resulted from the higher cost of designing the initial chipset in compared with subsequent chipset designs in when the manufacturers absorbed a portion of the engineering charges 
general administrative 
general administrative expense was million during  compared with million during  an increase of million or 
the increase in general administrative expense primarily resulted from increased director and officer insurance premiums in the fourth quarter  and costs incurred in for the bond exchange transaction 
marketing 
marketing includes the costs of retention support  subsidies distribution  advertising marketing  and amortization of our liability to gm 
these combined costs were million for  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
marketing expense increased due to increases in subsidies distribution of million  advertising marketing of million  amortization of gm liability of million  and retention and support of million 
retention support 
personnel related expenses comprise the majority of retention and support 
in  these costs were million compared to million in  an increase of million or 
subsidies distribution 
we currently provide incentives and subsidies for the manufacture  purchase  installation and activation of xm radios to attract and retain our manufacturing and distribution partners 
our subsidy and distribution costs are significant and totaled approximately million during  compared with million during  an increase of million due to being a full year of operations 
subscriber acquisition costs 
we consider subscriber acquisition costs to include radio manufacturer subsidies  sales  activation and installation commissions  and hardware related promotions 
these costs are reported in subsidies distribution 
the negative margins from equipment are also included in subscriber acquisition costs 
subscriber acquisition costs do not include ongoing loyalty payments to retailers and distribution partners  payments under revenue sharing arrangements with radio manufacturers and distributors and guaranteed payments to general motors 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred expenses of million  and million  respectively  related to subscriber acquisition costs 
our average subscriber acquisition cost was during advertising marketing 
activities comprising these expenses include media  advertising  events and direct marketing programs 
advertising marketing costs were million in compared with million in  an increase of million or as a result of a full year of operations in cost per gross addition 
we consider cpga to include the amounts in sac  as well as advertising  media and other discretionary marketing expenses 
in our financial statements  sac costs are captured in subsidies distribution and the negative margins from equipment sales  while cpga costs are captured by the combination of subsidies distribution  advertising marketing  plus the negative margins from equipment sales 
cpga does not include marketing staff included in retention support or the amortization of the gm guaranteed payments included in amortization of gm liability 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred expenses of million  and million  respectively 
cpga for the full year was due to our launch late in and significant pre operations costs recorded  cpga figures for and prior are not meaningful 
amortization of gm liability 
these costs include the amortization of annual fixed guaranteed payment commitments to general motors  aggregating to million  under our long term distribution agreement with the onstar division of gm providing for the installation of xm radios in gm vehicles 
in we expensed  the annual fixed payment for that year 
we amended the agreement in june  and following the amendment began amortizing the annual fixed payments due through november  which approximated million  on a straight line basis 
we expensed million for  reflecting a pro rata portion of the fixed annual payment for the period from january through june and the straight line portion of the million for the remainder of the distribution agreement was amended again in january as a result of the january amendment and gm s current roll out plans  commencing in february we are recognizing the guaranteed payments due under the long term distribution agreement  which approximate million  on a straight line basis through september  the remaining term of the agreement 
impairment of goodwill 
we recognized an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
required that we perform an assessment of the fair value of our reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
as a result of the value of our stock and other securities being impacted by negative trends in the capital markets during  our market capitalization had fallen below our book value  indicating that our reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed the second step of the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of and recognized an impairment charge of million as required by sfas no 
depreciation amortization 
depreciation amortization expense was million during  compared with million during  an increase of million 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulted from our commencing depreciation of major components of our system  including our satellites and terrestrial systems  upon commencement of commercial operations in september during  we ceased amortizing goodwill and our dars license in accordance with our adoption of sfas no 
as a result of a solar array output power anomaly  during  we reduced the useful lives of our in orbit satellites from years to years 
interest income 
interest income was million during  compared with million during  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was the result of lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents during coupled with lower yields on our investments due to market conditions 
interest expense 
we recorded interest expense of million and million during and  respectively 
in addition  we capitalized interest costs of million and million associated with our dars license and our xm radio system during and other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of income from rental of office space in our corporate headquarters to third parties 
other income expense  net was million in  compared with million in  an increase of million 
the increase reflects a full year s rental income in compared with four month s rental income in  as we purchased our corporate headquarters in august net loss 
net loss for was million  compared with million for  an increase of million or 
the increase primarily reflects increases in operating expense  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense in connection with our ramp up of commercial operations  offset in part by the growth in our revenue 
ebitda 
net loss before interest income  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization is commonly referred to in our business as ebitda 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda for was million  compared with million for the increased loss is due primarily to an increase in operating expense in connection with our ramp up of commercial operations  offset in part by the growth in our revenue 
consistent with regulatory requirements  ebitda includes other income expense 
we believe editda is often a useful measure of a company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by our management to measure the operating performance of our business 
because we have funded and completed the build out of our system through the raising and expenditure of large amounts of capital  our results of operations reflect significant charges for depreciation  amortization and interest expense 
ebitda  which excludes this information  provides helpful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from the expenses associated with our physical plant or capital structure 
ebitda is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in our industry  although our measure of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda does not purport to represent operating activities  as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered as an alternative to those measurements as an indicator of our performance 
the reconciliation of net loss to ebitda is as follows in thousands year ended december  net loss as reported add back non ebitda items included in net loss interest income interest expense depreciation amortization ebitda liquidity and capital resources at december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million  which excludes million of restricted investments  and working capital of million 
cash and cash equivalents increased million during the increase resulted from million provided by financing activities and million provided by investing activities  offset by million used in operating activities 
the proceeds from financing activities resulted primarily from a private placement in january that resulted in the issuance of our senior secured discount convertible notes that yielded gross proceeds of million  the issuance of million shares of class a common stock that yielded gross proceeds of million  the issuance of our senior secured notes that yielded gross proceeds of million  and the issuance of million shares of class a common stock that yielded gross proceeds of million 
the financing activities completed during the year are more fully discussed below 
investing activities consisted primarily of proceeds provided from the maturity of restricted investments 
cash flows used in operating activities includes the net loss of million and the net cash used by our operating assets and liabilities  offset in part by non cash expenses included in the net loss 
by comparison  at december   we had total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  which excludes million of restricted investments  and working capital of million 
this amount reflects the use of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december   plus the proceeds of million from financing activities  to fund million of cash used in operations and million in investing activities 
the proceeds from financing activities resulted primarily from an equity offering during cash flow used in operations reflected the net loss from the company s first full year of commercial operations of million  and the accumulation of current liabilities as part of the company s efforts to conserve cash 
investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures for infrastructure and terrestrial system completion 
we expect that our future working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements will be satisfied from existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments augmented by the results of our january financing activities described below and by cash received from revenue generating activities 
our business plan contemplates the use of cash on hand to fund the completion and launch of xm and the construction of xm we may need to raise additional funding for the launch of xm depending on the amount and timing of the receipt of the insurance proceeds and other factors 
capital resources and financing we raised billion of equity and debt gross proceeds from inception through december  from investors and strategic partners to fund our operations 
in  we raised million of gross funds 
this includes million of gross funds raised in the january financing transactions  million of gross funds raised in the june transaction  including million raised in july from the exercise of an over allotment option  and million of gross funds raised in the september transactions  as well as million of funds raised through the direct stock purchase program 
the january financing transactions also included million of payment deferrals and a line of credit 
the proceeds received have been used to acquire our dars license  make required payments for our system  including the satellites  terrestrial repeater system  and ground networks  and for working capital and operating expenses 
provided that we meet the revenue  expense and cash flow projections of our business plan  we expect to be fully funded and will not need to raise additional financing to continue operations or to fund the completion and launch of xm and the construction of xm we may need to raise additional funding for the launch of xm depending on the amount and timing of the receipt of the insurance proceeds and other factors 
january financing transaction on january   we completed a public offering of  shares of our class a common stock at per share   shares of which were offered for sale by certain selling stockholders 
this  share offering resulted in gross proceeds to us of million 
the proceeds from this offering were used in part to repay the unvested portion of the senior secured convertible note held by onstar  a subsidiary of general motors 
we expect to use the proceeds for the prepayment of a portion of our outstanding debt as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes 
september financing transaction on september   we completed a public offering of  shares of our class a common stock at per share to legg mason funds management  inc  legg mason capital management  inc 
and another large institutional investor  each on behalf of its investment advisory clients 
this offering resulted in gross proceeds of million 
we expect that all or a significant portion of the net proceeds may be used for funding for the construction of xm  our new ground spare satellite  if insurance proceeds are not received in a timely manner 
we expect to otherwise use the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include the repurchase or pre payment of outstanding debt 
june financing transaction on june   we completed an offering of million  including million related to the over allotment option in july  of inc s senior secured notes due june  interest on the notes is payable every six months in cash in arrears on december and june  commencing on december  the notes  which are inc s senior secured obligations  are secured by substantially all of inc s assets  are guaranteed by the company and will rank equally in right of payment with all of inc s other existing and future senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of inc s existing and future subordinated indebtedness

we expect to otherwise use the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include the repurchase or pre payment of outstanding debt 
january financing transactions in january  we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount at maturity of our senior secured discount convertible notes due december   which yielded gross proceeds of million  and a private placement of  shares of our class a common stock  which yielded gross proceeds of million 
concurrently with these transactions  we completed an exchange offer in which we exchanged million aggregate principal amount of inc s previously outstanding senior secured notes due for million aggregate principal amount at maturity million accreted value as of march  of senior secured discount notes due  cash and warrants to purchase class a common stock 
in january  general motors provided us with a million senior secured credit facility  maturing as late as december  that enables us to make monthly draws to finance payments that become due under our distribution agreement with onstar corporation and other gm payments 
in january  this facility was amended and became a revolver 
xm and inc are co borrowers under this credit facility 
the outstanding principal amount of all draws will be due december  and bear interest at the applicable day libor rate plus through december   and presently bear interest at a per annum rate of libor plus 
we will be able to make interest payments semi annually in shares of class a common stock having an aggregate fair market value at the time of payment equal to the amount of interest due 
the fair market value will be based on the average daily trading prices of the class a common stock over the ten business days prior to the day the interest payment is due 
we have the option to prepay all draws in whole or in part at any time  and  with effect from the january amendment  may re borrow prepaid amounts 
beginning in  we will be required to prepay the amount of any outstanding advances in an amount equal to the lesser of i of our excess cash and ii the amount necessary to prepay the draws in full 
in order to make draws under the credit facility  we are required to have a certain minimum number of subscribers that are not originated by gm and a minimum pre marketing cash flow 
in january  we issued a senior secured convertible note due december  in the amount of million to general motors subsidiary  onstar corporation 
the note was provided in lieu of our obligation to make million in guaranteed payments to onstar under the distribution agreement from to the note becomes convertible at the holder s option on a quarterly basis through  at of the then fair market value of our class a common stock but subject to a per share minimum and escalation maximum up to per share for each fiscal year 
interest is payable semi annually in cash or shares of our class a common stock  at our option  at fair market value at the time of payment 
in february  we completed the redemption of the note 
as part of the redemption  general motors converted million in principal amount of the note  representing the entire principal amount of the note that had vested conversion rights at the time of the redemption  into  shares of our class a common stock in accordance with the terms of the note 
the remaining million in principal amount plus accrued interest was repaid with cash in january  general motors provided us with the ability to satisfy up to million in future subscriber acquisition payments that we may owe to onstar under the distribution agreement in shares of our class a common stock  valued at fair market value at the time of each semi annual payment 
other equity issuances and de leveraging transactions during the year ended december   we issued  shares of class a common stock for proceeds of million under our direct stock purchase program dspp 
concurrent with the funds raised through the dspp  we entered into agreements with certain holders of our notes to exchange million carrying value  or million fully accreted face value at maturity  of their notes  for million in cash consideration and  shares of class a common stock 
also concurrent with the funds raised through the dspp  we entered into agreements with certain holders of our series b convertible redeemable preferred stock to exchange million in shares of series b preferred stock for million in cash consideration 
we also entered into agreements with certain holders of our series c convertible redeemable preferred stock to exchange million carrying value  in shares of series c preferred stock  for  shares of class a common stock 
additionally  we entered into agreements with certain holders of class a common stock warrants to exchange  warrants convertible into  shares of class a common stock for  shares of common stock and received million in cash proceeds from the exercise of  warrants converted into  shares of class a common stock 
as a result of these de leveraging transactions  we have eliminated approximately million of carrying value including accrued interest of debt and preferred securities or approximately million of face amount at maturity 
we have eliminated million carrying value including accrued interest million face amount at maturity of our senior secured notes due  million carrying value including accrued interest million face amount at maturity of our senior secured discount notes due issued in january  million carrying value including accrued interest million of face amount at maturity of our convertible subordinated notes due  million carrying value including accrued interest million face amount at maturity of our senior secured discount convertible notes due  million of our series b preferred stock and million carrying value of our series c preferred stock 
in total  these de leveraging transactions have eliminated approximately million in future interest  dividends  accretion and principal payments as well as million shares of incremental dilution 
as a result of our financings and other issuances of securities  the conversion price of the series c preferred stock issued in august has been adjusted from at december  to at december   the exercise price of the warrants sold in march has been adjusted to and the number of warrant shares has been adjusted to 
the exercise price of the warrants sold in january remained at and the number of warrant shares remained at 
there was no impact on the consolidated results of operations as a result of the adjustments to these prices 
we expect that our future working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements will be satisfied from existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and by cash received from revenue generating activities 
our business plan contemplates the use of cash on hand to fund the construction and launch of xm and the construction of xm we may need to raise additional funding for the launch of xm depending on the amount and timing of the receipt of the insurance proceeds with respect to xm rock and xm roll  and other factors 
future operating and capital resource requirements our funding requirements are based on our current business plan  which in turn is based on our operating experience to date and our available resources 
we are pursuing a business plan designed to increase subscribers and revenues while reducing or maintaining subscriber acquisition costs and avoiding large expenditures to the extent practicable 
our plan contemplates our focusing on the new automobile market where we have relationships with automobile manufacturers  the continuing introduction of lower priced and more user friendly radio technology in the retail aftermarket and the use of our most productive distribution channels 
we have also maintained a lower level of spending on advertising and kept our workforce streamlined 
provided that we meet the revenue  expense and cash flow projections of our business plan  we expect to be fully funded and will not need to raise additional financing to continue operations 
our business plan is based on estimates regarding expected future costs and expected revenue 
our costs may exceed or our revenues may fall short of our estimates  our estimates may change  and future developments may affect our estimates 
any of these factors may increase our need for funds  which would require us to seek additional financing to continue implementing our current business plan 
our business plan contemplates the use of cash on hand to fund the completion and launch of xm and the construction of xm we may need to raise additional funding for the launch of xm depending on the amount and timing of the receipt of the insurance proceeds with respect to xm rock and xm roll  and other factors 
in the first quarter of  we filed the proofs of loss for constructive total loss claims on both our satellites with our insurance carriers for the aggregate sum insured less applicable salvage  relating to a progressive degradation problem with the solar array output power of boeing class satellites  including xm rock and xm roll  identified to our insurers in september we have launch and in orbit insurance policies that provide coverage to us for a total  constructive total or partial loss of each of our satellites where such loss arises from an occurrence within the first five years after launch both satellites were launched during the first half of 
the aggregate sum insured in the event of the total or constructive total loss of both satellites is million million per satellite 
during the third quarter of  we received letters from our insurers rejecting our proofs of loss and denying our claims 
we anticipate continuing correspondence and meetings with individual and groups of insurers to resolve this matter and will proceed with negotiations  arbitration or litigation as necessary to recover the losses 
we continue to believe that we will ultimately receive insurance payments adequate to launch our spare satellite and fund a portion of xm  although there can be no assurance as to the amount of any insurance proceeds  or that any insurance proceeds will be received in a timely manner 
in light of the progressive degradation noted above  we plan to launch our ground spare satellite xm into one orbital slot by year end  and operate xm rock and xm roll collocated in the other orbital slot 
in  we plan to launch xm to replace the collocated xm rock and xm roll 
in this way  we will have replacement satellites in orbit and operating prior to the times xm rock and xm roll can no longer provide full service  or half service in collocated mode 
our commitments regarding xm and xm are described under capital expenditures below 
since the solar array power degradation issue is common to the first six boeing class satellites now in orbit  the manufacturer and we are closely watching the progression of the problem  including data from a satellite that has been in orbit longer than either of our two satellites by approximately and months  respectively 
with this advance visibility of performance levels  a firm launch commitment for our spare satellite in the fourth quarter of  the ability to provide full service for an extended period of time with xm rock and xm roll collocated in one orbital slot and the spare located in the other slot which would allow partial use of the existing satellites through the first quarter of  firm commitments to build a fourth satellite and provide launch services therefore  and various mitigation actions to extend the full or partial use of the existing satellites  we believe that we will be able to launch additional satellites prior to the time the solar array power problem might cause the broadcast signal strength to fall below minimum acceptable levels 
based on the consistency of the degradation trends with no substantial improvement to date and continuing analyses by bss and us  our management adjusted the estimated useful lives of our in orbit satellites  with effect from september  to the period running through first quarter approximately years from launch 
our management will continue to monitor this situation carefully and may re adjust the estimated useful lives of our in orbit satellites based on future information 
we have not recorded any impairment due to our forecasted cash flows which are sufficient to recover the system assets  however  should we reduce or not meet our forecasted cash flows or reduce further the estimated useful lives of the satellites  we may be required to record an impairment which may be substantial at that time 
we have not adjusted the estimated useful lives of our spacecraft control facilities  as we believe that these facilities will continue to be of use in our system as xm and if necessary xm are launched 
we plan to seek additional financing for the launch of xm to the extent needed 
in addition  we may seek additional financing to undertake initiatives not contemplated by our current business plan or obtain additional cushion against possible shortfalls 
we may pursue a range of different sizes or types of financing as opportunities arise  particularly the sale of additional equity securities 
we have and may continue to take advantage of opportunities to reduce our level of indebtedness and preferred stock in exchange for issuing common or other equity securities  if these transactions can be completed on favorable terms 
in the event of unfavorable future developments  such as adverse developments in the debt and equity market of the type experienced during much of and  we may not be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain additional financing depends on several factors  including future market conditions  our success or lack of success in developing  implementing and marketing our satellite radio service  our future creditworthiness  and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders 
additional financings could increase our level of indebtedness or result in further dilution to our equity holders 
if we fail to obtain necessary financing on a timely basis  a number of adverse effects could occur  or we may have to revise our business plan 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are obligated to make significant payments under a variety of contracts and other commercial arrangements  including the following service providers

we must also share with gm a percentage of the subscription revenue attributable to gm vehicles with installed xm radios  which percentage increases until there are more than million gm vehicles with installed xm radios at which point the percentage remains constant 
we will also make available to gm bandwidth on our system 
as part of the agreement  onstar provides certain call center related services directly to xm subscribers who are also onstar customers and xm must reimburse onstar for these xm related call center services 
the agreement is subject to renegotiation at any time based upon the installation of radios that are compatible with a unified standard or capable of receiving sirius satellite radio s service 
the agreement is subject to renegotiation if as of november  and at two year intervals thereafter  gm does not achieve and maintain specified installation levels of gm vehicles capable of receiving our service  starting with  units by november  and thereafter increasing by the lesser of  units per year and amounts proportionate to target market shares in the satellite digital radio service market 
there can be no assurances as to the outcome of any such renegotiations 
general motors exclusivity obligations will discontinue if  by november and at two year intervals thereafter  we fail to achieve and maintain specified minimum market share levels in the satellite digital radio service market we are currently in excess of the minimum market share levels

we earned the following revenue from transactions with related parties described above in thousands years ended december  gm honda we have incurred the following costs in transactions with the related parties described above in thousands year ended december  gm hughes directv clear channel lcci motient terrestrial repeater network terrestrial repeater site leases customer care billing operations marketing general administrative year ended december  gm hughes directv clear channel lcci motient terrestrial repeater network terrestrial repeater site leases customer care and billing operations marketing general administrative year ended december  gm hughes directv clear channel lcci motient terrestrial repeater network terrestrial repeater site leases customer care billing operations marketing general administrative capital expenditures as of december   we had paid approximately million  including financing charges and interest under the satellite contract related to xm rock  or xm  xm roll  or xm  xm and xm we originally entered into our satellite contract in march with boeing satellite systems international  inc  or bss  and have subsequently amended the contract  including in july and december satellite contract xm rock and xm roll 
under our satellite contract  bss has delivered two satellites in orbit  xm rock and xm roll  supplied ground equipment and software used in the xm radio system and provided certain launch and operations support services 
satellite contract replacement satellites deployment plan 
in light of the progressive degradation affecting rock and roll noted above  we plan to launch our ground spare satellite  xm  into one orbital slot by year end  and then temporarily operate xm rock and xm roll collocated in the other orbital slot 
in  we plan to launch xm to replace the collocated xm rock and xm roll 
in this way  we will have replacement satellites in orbit and operating prior to the times xm rock and xm roll can no longer provide full service  or half service in the collocated mode 
satellite contract and other costs xm construction of our ground spare satellite  xm  is currently being completed  including certain modifications to correct the solar array degradation issues experienced by rock and roll  as well as other changes agreed with bss discussed below 
as of december   with respect to xm  we have deferred million at an interest rate of through december  and borrowed million from boeing capital in a separate transaction to be repaid prior to launch of xm in addition to the modifications to address the solar array degradation issues as noted above  bss is making certain alterations to optimize xm for the specific orbital slot into which it will be launched during a three month launch period commencing october  the aggregate remaining cost  excluding the above million deferral and million loan  of the launch  optimization for the specific orbital slot  appropriate software and certain pre and post launch services is approximately million to be paid during the first quarter further  bss has the right to earn performance incentive payments of up to million  excluding interest  based on the in orbit performance of xm over its design life of fifteen years 
satellite insurance xm in addition to the xm related costs noted above  we plan to acquire and pay for launch and in orbit insurance in connection with the launch of xm the cost of launch and in orbit insurance for this launch is subject to market prices and conditions at the time during when such insurance is obtained 
satellite contract and other costs xm we have committed in our satellite contract  as amended in july  and by a separate august contract with sea launch company  llc  or sea launch  to acquire from bss a fourth satellite  xm  which should be available for shipment to the launch services provider no later than october   and from sea launch the associated launch services for the satellite 
the fixed prices for xm and the associated launch services total million  excluding in orbit performance incentives and financing charges on certain amounts deferred prior to launch 
following our payment of million in total for xm and the associated launch services during the third quarter  satellite construction payments aggregating approximately million are deferred until as late as the first quarter interest accrues monthly at a rate of per annum through december and is payable thereafter on a current basis  pursuant to the december amendment  which extends the deferral from the first quarter and reduces the applicable interest rate from to 
of this deferred amount  million is in the other non current liabilities line on our balance sheet as of december  most of the remaining portion of the fixed costs for xm and the associated launch services are payable during construction with the last payment due one month following launch 
after launch of xm  bss has the right to earn performance incentive payments of up to million  plus interest  over the first twelve years of in orbit life  up to million for performance above specification during the first fifteen years of in orbit life  and up to million for continued high performance across the five year period beyond the fifteen year design life 
if xm is launched successfully and operates satisfactorily  we may elect  under the above contracts  to defer launch of xm and  as a result  approximately million in payments related to launch services could be postponed until the timeframe 
options to procure fifth satellite and associated launch services 
we have also obtained fixed price options to acquire a fifth satellite from bss  under the july amendment  on pricing and performance incentive terms similar to those applicable to xm and associated launch services from sea launch under the august contract 
satellite contract warrant to bss 
pursuant to our satellite contract  we issued a warrant to bss in july to purchase  shares of our class a common stock at per share 
the fair value of these warrants was determined to be million using a black scholes based methodology and is included in the system under construction balance as of december  terrestrial repeater system 
as of december   we incurred aggregate costs of approximately million for a terrestrial repeater system 
these costs covered the capital cost of the design  development and installation of a system of terrestrial repeaters to cover approximately cities and metropolitan areas 
in august  we signed a contract with lcci for engineering and site preparation 
as of december   we had paid million under this contract 
there are no further payments due under the lcci contract 
we also entered into a contract effective october   with hughes electronics corporation for the design  development and manufacture of the terrestrial repeaters  there are no further payments due under this contract except those related to ongoing out of warranty repairs 
as of december   we had paid million under this contract and recorded an additional liability of  ground segment 
as of december   we incurred aggregate ground segment costs of approximately million 
these costs were related to the satellite control facilities  programming production studios and various other equipment and facilities 
joint development agreement funding requirements 
the costs related to our agreement with sirius radio for joint development of a unified standard for satellite radios are being expensed as incurred in research development 
during  we incurred million compared to no expense during we expect this expense to increase steadily this year  each party is obligated to fund one half of the development cost for a unified standard for satellite radios 
long term debt we have raised funds from the following issuances of long term debt 
in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in july and august  holders of these convertible subordinated notes exchanged million of notes for  shares of our class a common stock 
in  an additional million of these notes were exchanged for  shares of class a common stock 
as a result of these transactions  approximately million of the notes remained at december  principal on the convertible subordinated notes is payable at maturity  while interest is payable semi annually 
in march  the holders of the million convertible subordinated notes due called for redemption following our january offering elected to convert into million shares of our class a common stock in accordance with the terms of the notes 
this represented the retirement of all our remaining outstanding subordinated convertible notes 
in august  we borrowed million to finance the purchase of our headquarters facility 
this loan is for a term of five years and bears interest at a rate based on the six month london interbank offer rate plus an indicated spread 
we make monthly payments of principal and interest on this loan 
in december  we borrowed million from a subsidiary of the boeing company 
this loan is for a term of five years and bears interest at a rate based on the six month london interbank offer rate plus an indicated spread 
principal is payable at maturity  while interest is payable quarterly 
this loan must be repaid when we launch xm  presently expected to occur in late on january   we completed a three part financing 
we issued million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior secured discount convertible notes in a private placement 
principal on the senior secured discount convertible notes is payable at maturity  while interest accretes until january  and is thereafter payable semi annually in cash or  at our option  in additional notes 
if all of the interest is paid in additional notes  these notes would aggregate million when they come due in we issued to onstar  a subsidiary of general motors  million in aggregate principal amount of a senior secured convertible note due december  in lieu of our obligation to make million in guaranteed payments from to under the general motors distribution agreement 
principal on the onstar note is payable at maturity  while interest  which is due semi annually  is payable at our option in shares of our class a common stock 
in february  we completed the redemption of the note 
as part of the redemption  general motors converted million in principal amount of the note  representing the entire principal amount of the note that had vested conversion rights at the time of the redemption  into  shares of our class a common stock in accordance with the terms of the note 
the remaining million in principal amount plus accrued interest was repaid with cash

in june  inc issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due  million of which were issued in july  pursuant to the overallotment option 
principal on the senior secured notes due is payable at maturity  while interest is payable semi annually 
based on the various terms of our long term debt  our ability to redeem any long term debt is limited 
we have and may continue to take advantage of opportunities to reduce our level of indebtedness in exchange for issuing equity securities  if these transactions can be completed on favorable terms 
lease obligations 
we have noncancelable operating leases for office space and terrestrial repeater sites and noncancelable capital leases for equipment that expire over the next ten years 
as discussed below  in december  we determined that the planned number of terrestrial repeater sites could be reduced due to the relative signal strength provided by our satellites 
we recognized a charge of million with respect to terrestrial repeater sites no longer required 
this charge includes a lease termination liability of million for terrestrial repeater site leases  which would reduce the future minimum lease payments 
this liability was increased by million during and by million during as of december   we maintained a liability of million for the estimated lease termination costs and costs to deconstruct the sites 
the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december   adjusted for the conversion of our convertible subordinated notes into class a common stock in march of and the repayment of our million senior secured convertible note due held by onstar corporation  a subsidiary of general motors  in february of payments due by period contractual obligations and beyond total in thousands gm distribution agreement gm revolver gm note boeing note other long term debt capital lease obligations other operating agreements operating lease obligations xm xm total the above amounts do not include interest  which in some cases is variable in amount 
other operating agreements include programming  marketing and royalty agreements 
the above amounts include agreements amended or entered into in january exclude financing charges  in orbit incentives  and launch insurance  and assumes launch of xm in the long term debt payments due in include the maturity of our million loan to finance the purchase of our headquarters facility 
the long term debt payments due in and beyond include the maturity of xm s remaining outstanding million of senior secured notes  which come due in  the maturity of xm s million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior secured discount notes  which come due in  the maturity of our million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior secured discount convertible notes  which come due in  and the maturity of our million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior secured notes due in january  the credit facility arrangement with gm was renegotiated to become a revolver providing for borrowings up to a maximum of million through the maturity of the instrument in december in march  the holders of the million convertible subordinated notes due called for redemption following our january offering elected to convert into million shares of our class a common stock in accordance with the terms of the notes 
this represented the retirement of all our remaining outstanding subordinated convertible notes 
also  in february  we repaid the million senior secured convertible note through the issuance of cash and shares of class a common stock 
xm s senior secured notes due provide for a partial redemption up to a maximum of million within days of an equity issuance 
xm completed an equity issuance on january   and thus has days to redeem a portion of these notes 
critical accounting and subscriber policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include those pertaining to the following policies 
senior management has discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of estimates and assumptions required for the following accounting policies revenue recognition revenue from subscribers consists of our monthly subscription fee  which is recognized as the service is provided  and a non refundable activation fee  which is recognized on a pro rata basis over an estimated term of the subscriber relationship currently months  which was based upon market studies and management s judgment 
we expect to refine this estimate as more data becomes available 
promotions and discounts are treated as an offset to revenue during the period of promotion 
sales incentives  consisting of discounts and rebates to subscribers  offset earned revenue 
discounts to equipment which is sold with service are allocated to equipment and service based on relative fair value 
if the actual term of our subscriber relationships is significantly greater than our current estimate of months  the period over which we recognize the non refundable activation fee will be extended to reflect the actual term of our subscriber relationships 
estimates of payments due to manufacturers and distributors payments owed to manufacturing and distribution partners are expensed during the month in which the manufacture  sale  and or activation of the radio unit occurs 
the amounts of these expenses are dependent upon units provided by our internal systems and processes  such as subscriber management system and supply chain management system and partner systems and processes 
however  due to lags in receiving manufacturing and sales data from partners  estimates of amounts due are necessary in order to record monthly expenses 
in subsequent months when lagged data is received from partners  expenses are reconciled  and adjusted where necessary 
since launching commercial operations  we continue to refine the estimation process based on an increased understanding of the timing lags  and close working relationships with our partners 
generally  estimates recorded on our books are adjusted to actuals within two months 
useful life of satellites and spacecraft control facilities following receipt of our satellites  we extended their expected lives from years  the initial design life  to years based upon updated technical estimates we received from our satellite provider following our satellite launches 
however  based on the consistency of the degradation trends with no substantial improvement to date and continuing analyses by boeing satellite systems and us  as described above under the heading liquidity and capital resources future operating and capital resource requirements  we adjusted the estimated useful life of our in orbit satellites with effect from september  to the period running through first quarter of approximately years from launch 
we continue to monitor the situation and may need to re adjust the estimated useful lives of our in orbit satellites based on future information 
we are not recording an impairment at this time  due to our forecasted cash flows which are sufficient to recover the system assets  however  should we reduce or not meet our forecasted cash flows or reduce further the estimated useful lives of the satellites  we may be required to record an impairment which may be substantial at that time 
an impairment  if recorded  would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows 
at december   the combined carrying value of xm and xm is million 
the receipt of insurance proceeds would reduce the carrying values of xm and xm and would mitigate the risk of a future impairment 
based on the forecasted cash flows in our current business plan and without receipt of insurance proceeds  a reduction of months in the estimated useful lives of xm and xm could result in an impairment charge in the period in which the estimated useful lives are reduced 
we have not adjusted the estimated useful lives of our spacecraft control facilities  as we believe that these facilities will continue to be used in our xm system 
a significant decrease in the estimated useful life of our satellites and spacecraft control facilities could have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the period in which the estimate is revised and in subsequent periods 
accrued network optimization expenses as a result of the planned reduction of the number of terrestrial repeater sites  we recognized charges of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the charge of million in included million of site specific capitalized costs that were written off and a lease termination accrual of million for terrestrial repeater site leases 
the charges of million and million in and  respectively  represent additional costs associated with terminating leases on terrestrial repeater sites no longer required 
at december   we had recorded a lease termination accrual of million that represents an estimate of the costs to terminate the remaining leases based on management s judgment  advice of lease consultants  and early negotiations with landlords 
the liability also includes the estimated costs to deconstruct the existing sites  which are based upon quotes from contractors 
this amount could vary significantly from the actual amount incurred  which will be primarily based on our ability to negotiate lease termination settlements 
programming agreements we have entered into various programming agreements 
under the terms of these agreements  we are obligated to provide payments and commissions to other entities that may include fixed payments  advertising commitments and revenue sharing arrangements 
fixed amounts due under programming agreements are recognized on a straight line basis though the termination and or renegotiation date defined in the agreements 
revenue share agreements that contain minimum guarantees are recorded as an expense based upon the greater of the revenue share amount or a pro rata portion of the guarantee over the guarantee period 
distribution agreement with general motors we have significant payment obligations under our distribution agreement with general motors  which was amended on january  to provide that we could make certain payments by issuance of indebtedness or shares of class a common stock 
this agreement is subject to renegotiation if general motors does not achieve and maintain specified installation levels  starting with  by november and thereafter increasing by the lesser of  units per year and amounts proportionate to our share of the satellite digital radio market 
in light of gm s initial roll out plans  the june amendment of the distribution agreement and management s assessment of the likelihood of renegotiating during the period ending  we recognized the fixed payment obligations due to gm for the period through november  which approximate million  on a straight line basis 
in light of the january amendment of the distribution agreement and gm s current roll out plans which demonstrate a likelihood of gm exceeding minimum installation targets  in we are prospectively recognizing fixed payment obligations to gm  which approximate million  on a straight line basis through the remaining term of the agreement in september additional fixed payment obligations beyond range from million to approximately million through  aggregating approximately million 
dars license 
we determined that our dars license was an intangible asset having an indefinite useful life 
while the dars license has a renewable eight year term  we believe that the administrative fees necessary to renew the license are expected to be de minimis compared to the initial fee to obtain the license  and we have met all of the established milestones specified in the dars license agreement 
we also anticipate no difficulties in renewing the license as long as we continue to adhere to the various regulatory requirements established in the license grant 
although we face competition from a variety of sources  we do not believe that the risk of the technology becoming obsolete or that a decrease in demand for the dars service is significant 
further  we believe that our license is comparable with the licenses granted to other broadcasters  which are also classified as indefinite lived intangible assets 
we understand that there continues to be deliberations concerning the application of this standard regarding the effect of the costs to renew fcc licenses 
our application of this standard could change depending upon the results of these deliberations 
subscriber count 
we consider subscribers to be those who are receiving and have agreed to pay for our service  either by credit card or by invoice  including those that are currently in promotional periods  as well as xm activated radios in vehicles for which we have a contractual right to receive payment for the use of our service 
radios that are revenue generating are counted individually as subscribers 
approximately of our subscribers at year end were in promotional periods with sponsored accounts 
a change in our methodology of counting subscribers that excluded subscribers in promotional periods with sponsored accounts would delay the timing of the recognition of the subscriber until the end of the promotional period  which is generally months 
subscribers with delinquent account balances are included in the subscriber count until such time as the radio is deactivated for non payment in accordance with our normal procedures 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective january   and sfas no 
does not have a material impact on the financial statements 
our asset retirement obligations are limited to deconstruction of its terrestrial repeater sites 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when a new liability is recorded  we will capitalize the costs of the liability by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
amends existing guidance on reporting gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt to prohibit the classification of the gain or loss as extraordinary  as the use of such extinguishments have become part of the risk management strategy of many companies 
sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
to require sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
we recorded losses of million during the year ended december   respectively from the early retirement of debt with a carrying value including accrued interest of million 
the loss is reported in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when incurred at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
may have an effect on the timing of future restructuring charges taken  if and when they occur 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
the disclosures required by sfas no 
are included in note k to the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  on december   the fasb issued final modified fasb interpretation no 
fin r  primarily to clarify the required accounting for interests in vies 
application of fin r is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in entities that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities  or spes  for periods ending after december  application by public entities for all other types of vies ie  non spes is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  the adoption of fin r is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position or the financials results of the company 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
addresses the classification and measurement of mandatorially redeemable freestanding financial instruments  including those that comprise more than one option or forward contract  and requires an issuer to classify certain instruments as liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period after june  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material effect on the classification and measurement of our financing transactions but may have an effect on the classification and measurement of future mandatorially redeemable financing transactions  if and when they occur 
the emerging issues task force issued eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables addressing the allocation of revenue among products and services in bundled sales arrangements 
eitf is effective for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods after june  based on the sales and marketing programs in place during  the application of the new pronouncement has not had a material impact on our financial statements 
however  our sales and marketing programs may change over time and we will continue to evaluate the applicability of eitf as it relates to sales of service and hardware 
this new pronouncement has no impact on the economics of our sales and marketing programs  but it does impact the timing and classification of revenue reported within the financial statements and has a corresponding impact on the average revenue per subscriber arpu 
as a result of this new pronouncement  the company recognized a lower subscriber arpu for the period 
in july  the emerging issues task force provided additional guidance on topic d  the effect on the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption or induced conversion of preferred stock 
the additional guidance states that the carrying amount of preferred stock should be reduced by the issuance costs of the preferred stock in the calculation of earnings per share 
this guidance is effective in fiscal periods ending after september  and is retroactively reflected in the financial statements of prior quarters 
this guidance resulted in a reduction of the gains recorded on the retirement of our series b preferred stock during of  to reflect the amount of the issuance costs of the preferred stock retired 
the net loss available to common stockholders for reflects these adjustments 
this guidance did not impact our net loss or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we do not have any derivative financial instruments and do not intend to use derivatives 
we do not hold or issue any free standing derivatives 
we invest our cash in short term commercial paper  investment grade corporate and government obligations and money market funds 
our long term debt includes fixed interest rates and the fair market value of the debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we run the risk that market rates will decline and the required payments will exceed those based on current market rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the mortgage on our corporate headquarters has a variable interest rate that may not exceed a ceiling rate of or a floor rate of 
our loan of million from boeing also has a variable interest rate 
included in our related party long term debt owed to gm is a balance of million  of which million may be converted to shares of class a common stock under our distribution agreement with onstar and million will be drawn under our senior secured credit facility with gm 
this facility also has a variable interest rate 
a change of one percentage point in the interest rate applicable to this million of variable rate debt at december  would result in a fluctuation of approximately million in our annual interest expense 
we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not material to our results of operations
