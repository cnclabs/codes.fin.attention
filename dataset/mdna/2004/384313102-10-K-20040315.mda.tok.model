item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made to the information elsewhere in this report for background information on our businesses  industry and related matters 
repositioning our global manufacturing network and other initiatives in january  we announced a major cost savings plan that we believe is one of the most aggressive major cost reduction plans being implemented in our industry 
the key elements of the plan consist of o the further rationalization of graphite electrode manufacturing capacity at our higher cost facilities and the expansion of capacity at our lower cost facilities  o the implementation of global business and work process changes  o the redesign and implementation of changes in our benefit plans for active and retired employees  o the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries to generate significant tax savings  and o sales of non strategic assets 
under the plan  we are targeting cumulative recurring annual pretax cost savings of million in and million in savings achieved under the plan are additive to those which we achieved by the end of under our global restructuring and rationalization plan 
all cost savings described below under this section entitled repositioning our global manufacturing network and other initiatives are included in the aggregate amounts set forth above 
we achieved recurring pretax cost savings of million in  for total cumulative savings of million since january  we recorded an aggregate of million of restructuring charges and million of impairment losses on long lived and other assets  and expect to record an additional million of restructuring charges primarily for severance associated with further global business and work process changes  but excluding additional restructuring charges that may be recorded relating to the closure of the majority of the graphite electrode manufacturing operations in italy  in connection with the plan 
these charges include payments through december  of million of cash costs and expected payments of an additional million of cash costs 
all charges described below under this section entitled repositioning our global manufacturing network and other initiatives are included in the aggregate amounts set forth above 
remaining actions associated with the plan that could result in additional restructuring charges relate primarily to the implementation of global work process changes and additional overhead cost reductions 
rationalization of our global manufacturing network 
we have repositioned our global manufacturing network by rationalizing our higher cost manufacturing facilities and redeploying capacity to our remaining larger  lower cost  strategically located facilities 
graphite electrodes 
in and  we shut down the high cost graphite electrode manufacturing operations at our facilities in canada and germany and rationalized the graphite electrode manufacturing operations at our facilities in russia 
in  we shut down the high cost graphite electrode manufacturing operations at our facilities in tennessee 
in  we recorded a million restructuring charge and a million impairment loss on long lived assets primarily relating to the shutdown in tennessee 
in addition  in  we incrementally expanded graphite electrode manufacturing capacity at our lower cost facilities in mexico  spain and south africa for a capital investment of about million 
in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million restructuring charge and a million impairment loss on long lived assets in connection with the planned mothballing of our high cost graphite electrode manufacturing operations at our facility in italy 
in  we mothballed the italian facility and recorded an additional million restructuring charge 
these operations had the capacity to manufacture  metric tons of graphite electrodes annually 
at the end of  we announced the permanent closure of the majority of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in italy 
we also recorded a million impairment loss on long lived assets relating to the remaining fixed assets 
in the next twelve to eighteen months  we may record additional restructuring charges and incur additional exit costs in connection with such closure 
it is also possible that we may  at any time  decide to permanently shut down our remaining graphite electrode operations in italy 
in such event  we may record additional restructuring charges and incur additional exit costs 
during the second quarter  we launched the expansion of our graphite electrode manufacturing facility in mexico from about  metric tons to about  metric tons annually 
we completed  metric tons of expansion at this facility by the end of we completed the remaining  metric tons of expansion during the first quarter 
the second quarter was the first full quarter of operation of the fully expanded capacity 
in and  we also incrementally expanded graphite electrode manufacturing capacity at our other facilities 
the expansions required capital investments of about million 
the repositioning of our network allows us to deliver the same graphite electrode sales volume that we delivered over the past few years with a significantly lower fixed cost base 
with the repositioning and our proprietary process and technological improvements  we now have the capability  depending on product demand and mix  to manufacture more than  metric tons of graphite electrodes from our existing assets 
other products 
in  we shut down our coal calcining operations in new york primarily because we entered into a five year agreement to purchase calcined coal from a third party at a competitive cost 
we recorded a million impairment loss on the related long lived assets 
in  we also launched operations on our new advanced natural graphite production line  which was financed with a portion of the net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in july in  we recorded a million impairment loss on our long lived carbon electrode assets in tennessee as a result of a decline in demand and loss of market share 
the primary end market for carbon electrodes is silicon metal  which was very depressed in the us where our main customer base is located 
redesign and implementation of changes to global manufacturing  marketing and sales processes 
we have evaluated virtually every aspect of our global supply chain  and we have redesigned and implemented changes to our global manufacturing  marketing and sales processes to leverage the strengths of our repositioned network 
among other things  we have eliminated manufacturing bottlenecks  improved product and service quality and delivery reliability  expanded our range of products  and improved our global sourcing and product mix for our customers 
since  we have reduced annual customer compensation for graphite electrode quality claims from million to less than million 
we also redirected marketing and sales activities to better service the needs of both existing and new customers 
redesign and implementation of changes to benefit plans 
in the fourth quarter and the first quarter  we redesigned and implemented changes in our retiree medical insurance plan and our us retirement and savings plans for active employees 
among other things  we froze our qualified defined benefit plan and established a new defined contribution plan for most of our us employees 
in july  we amended our us post retirement medical coverage 
effective march   we discontinued the medicare supplement plan for retirees years or older or those eligible for medicare benefits 
this change applies to all active employees except for some employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement  all current retirees who were not covered by a collective bargaining agreement when they retired and those retirees who retired under a former collective bargaining agreement 
in june  we announced the termination of the early retiree medical plan for retirees under age  effective december  in addition  we will limit the amount of retiree s life insurance after december  the impact of these changes is being amortized over the average remaining period to full eligibility of the related post retirement benefits and resulted in a million net benefit in that is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations 
effective march  we froze our qualified defined benefit plan for our remaining us employees and closed our non qualified us defined benefit plan for the participating salaried workforce 
the closure and settlement of our non qualified us defined benefit plan resulted in a million restructuring charge in the first quarter 
implementation of changes to global business processes 
we began to implement in and continue to implement global business and work process rationalization and transformation initiatives  including o the streamlining of our organizational structure within our three major lines of business  o the consolidation and streamlining of order fulfillment  purchasing  finance and accounting  and human resource processes  o the identification and implementation of outsourcing opportunities  o the improvement in performance through realignment and enterprise wide standardization of supply chain processes and systems  and o the improvement of interfaces and information technology infrastructures with trading partners 
these activities are targeted for completion by the end of through december   our investment in these initiatives included about million of consulting fees and internal costs and million of capital expenditures  primarily for costs related to implementation of global information technology systems for advanced planning and scheduling software and for global treasury management systems 
we have also implemented and continue to implement an enterprise wide risk management process whereby we assess the business risks to our goal of maximizing cash flow  using a structured and disciplined approach 
this approach seeks to align our personnel and processes with our critical strategic risks so that our management team and gti s board of directors may better evaluate and manage those uncertainties 
effective april  we entered into a ten year service contract with cgi group inc cgi valued at million 
pursuant to this contract  cgi became the delivery arm for our global information technology service requirements  including the design and implementation of our global information and advanced manufacturing and demand planning processes  using jd edwards software 
through this contract  we are seeking to transform our information technology service capability into an efficient  high quality enabler for our global supply chain initiatives as well as a contributor to our cost reduction activities 
under the outsourcing provisions of this contract  cgi manages our data center services  networks  desktops  telecommunications and legacy systems 
through this contract  we believe that we will be able to leverage the resources of cgi to assist us in achieving our information technology goals and our cost savings targets 
in the third quarter  we entered into a ten year outsourcing contract with cgi valued at million 
pursuant to this contract  cgi became the delivery arm for our finance and accounting business process services  including accounts receivable and accounts payable activities 
cgi also provides various related analytical services such as general accounting  cost accounting and financial analysis activities 
through this contract  we believe that we will be able to further leverage the resources of cgi to assist us in achieving our cost savings targets 
severance programs 
we have implemented and continue to implement voluntary and selective severance programs  designed to complement our global business and work process rationalization and transformation initiatives 
through december   we substantially completed us voluntary and selective severance programs announced in december  resulting in a reduction of us employees or of the us salaried workforce 
we recorded an million restructuring charge in the first quarter in connection with these programs 
from through december   we reduced our global workforce by about  employees  or over 
current severance programs are expected to reduce our global workforce by about employees or about over the next to months 
corporate realignment of our subsidiaries 
in the first half  we substantially completed the realignment of our foreign subsidiaries under the plan 
most of the operations and net sales of our synthetic graphite line of business are located outside the us and  as a result of the realignment  are held by our swiss subsidiary or its subsidiaries 
most of our technology is held by our us subsidiaries 
the realignment of our foreign subsidiaries has resulted and is expected to result in substantial tax savings 
we used opportunities created by the realignment to improve cash management and corporate services delivery and reallocate intercompany debt as well as reduce taxes 
this reallocation of intercompany debt better matches intercompany debt with cash flow from operations 
debt service on our intercompany debt provides an important source of funds to repay our debt to third parties  including the senior facilities  the senior notes and the debentures 
the legal and tax restructuring and global realignment mentioned herein are part of the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries 
the tax benefits from the realignment have been recorded separately on the consolidated financial statements from expenses to implement the realignment which are included in other income expense  net 
sales of non strategic assets 
net cash proceeds from asset sales in totaled million  including the sale of our non strategic composite tooling business based in california in june for million which included a million working capital adjustment and the termination of our executive life insurance program and liquidation of our split dollar life insurance policies for executives for net cash proceeds of million 
we intend to continue to sell real estate  non strategic businesses and certain other non strategic assets 
we are targeting an additional million of asset sales in  for an aggregate total of about million from january  through the end of recent strategic alliance developments we have developed a strategic alliance in the cathode business with pechiney  the world s recognized leader in aluminum smelting technology 
to broaden our alliance  in march  we contributed our brazilian cathode manufacturing operations to carbone savoie 
pechiney  our joint venture partner in carbone savoie  contributed approximately million in cash to carbone savoie as part of this transaction 
the cash contribution was used to upgrade manufacturing operations in brazil and france  which was completed by the end of the first quarter 
ownership in carbone savoie remains by us and by pechiney 
carbone savoie holds our entire cathode manufacturing capacity 
we have been working with ballard power systems since on developing natural graphite based materials for use in its pem fuel cells 
in june  our subsidiary  aet  entered into an expanded exclusive development and collaboration agreement and an expanded exclusive long term supply agreement with ballard power systems 
in addition  ballard power systems became a strategic investor in aet in june  investing at that time million in shares of ballard power systems common stock for a equity ownership interest in aet 
in april  we entered into a graphite electrode production joint venture with jilin in china 
we are required to make capital contributions of million of cash million of which has been contributed to date plus technical assistance million of which has been contributed to date for our ownership interest in the joint venture 
during the fourth quarter  we recorded an impairment loss of million associated with our investment in the joint venture 
this impairment resulted from uncertainty about the completion and start up of the joint venture facilities in china due to the effects that the challenging graphite electrode industry conditions had on jilin 
we continue to work with jilin on alternatives 
however  we will make no further contributions to the joint venture until we have agreed upon an alternative 
global economic conditions and outlook we are impacted in varying degrees  both positively and negatively  as global  regional or specific country conditions fluctuate 
over the past three years through the first half  we faced extremely challenging business and industry conditions 
adverse global and regional economic conditions negatively impacted many of the end markets for our products 
many of the customers in these markets reduced production levels which reduced demand and adversely impacted prices for products sold by us and our competitors  became less creditworthy  filed for bankruptcy protection or were acquired as part of the consolidation trends within their industries 
in the second half  global and certain regional economies began to strengthen 
in addition  for most of this period  industry wide capacity for most of our products exceeded demand 
we have been experiencing intense competition  particularly in the graphite electrode industry 
economic weakening in north america continued and became more severe in this economic weakness was exacerbated by the impact on economic conditions of the terrorist acts in the us in september electric arc furnace steel production declined in as compared to by about in the us worldwide electric arc furnace steel production was stable in as compared to  as declines in the us  asia excluding china and south america were offset by gains in china 
the decline of electric arc furnace steel production in south america was caused primarily by shortages of electricity brought on by a drought that reduced hydroelectric power generation in brazil that was largely relieved in  and a currency  debt and related economic crisis in neighboring argentina 
worldwide electric arc furnace steel production in was million metric tons  about of total steel production  which was similar to while worldwide electric arc furnace steel production was stable  weaker economic conditions resulted in reduced production and  in some cases  the closing of older  less efficient electric arc furnaces 
this led to a decline in demand for graphite electrodes worldwide 
we estimate that worldwide graphite electrode sales volume declined in as compared to by about 
overall pricing worldwide was weak throughout most of this period 
while we implemented increases in local currency selling prices of our graphite electrodes in and early in europe  the asia pacific region  the middle east and south africa  we were not able to maintain all of these price increases 
our volume of graphite electrodes sold declined in as compared to by about due primarily to the decline in demand for graphite electrodes worldwide as well as weak economic conditions in some of our more important markets  our efforts to implement and maintain local currency selling price increases and our efforts to seek to minimize credit risks 
the global and regional economic conditions that impacted demand and prices for graphite electrodes also impacted demand and prices for most of our other products 
in general  demand was relatively stable and pricing remained relatively weak 
demand and prices for graphite cathodes remained relatively strong primarily due to construction of new aluminum smelters using graphite cathodes  even as old smelters using carbon cathodes are removed from service 
global economic conditions remained relatively weak into  but strengthened slightly in certain markets during the course of the year 
we estimate that worldwide electric arc furnace steel production increased by about in to a total of about million metric tons  about of total steel production from this increase was primarily due to an increase in production in the us  mexico  brazil and asia 
in march  president bush announced his decision to impose tariffs  of up to initially and declining thereafter over a three year period  on most imported steel as part of a broader plan to rescue the financially troubled steel industry in the us several additional exemptions were granted in by the bush administration 
we believe that the tariffs had a modest positive impact on electric arc furnace steel production in the us while steel imported from mexico was exempt from the tariffs  steel imported from europe and asia was not exempt 
steel production in those regions had been adversely impacted by the tariffs in in november  the world trade organization ruled that these tariffs are illegal 
in december  president bush announced his decision to lift the tariffs 
in turn  the world trade organization dropped its pursuit of retaliation against the us and china cancelled many of its steel trade safeguards and duties 
worldwide graphite electrode demand was very depressed in the first quarter  but rebounded from those depressed levels during the balance of during the last three quarters of  we utilized virtually all of our graphite electrode manufacturing capacity 
for the entire year  our volume of graphite electrodes sold increased about from we believe that worldwide graphite electrode demand increased by in from we believe that graphite electrode pricing declined by about in as compared to  driven by global and industry economic conditions in and early and the fact that the prices of graphite electrodes sold in were largely negotiated during the order book season in late when global economic conditions were weak 
demand and prices for cathodes remained strong primarily due to construction of new aluminum smelters using graphite cathodes  even as old smelters using carbon cathodes were removed from service 
we used virtually all of our cathode manufacturing capacity during and our volume of cathodes sold increased about in from weak economic conditions in resulted in relatively low demand and weak pricing for most of our other products 
global and certain regional economic conditions began to strengthen in the second half 
steel production increased globally and was particularly strong in china 
we estimate that worldwide steel production was about million metric tons in we estimate that electric arc furnace steel production increased correspondingly  to about million metric tons in we operated our graphite electrode manufacturing capacity at very high levels  and estimate that excluding china  for which reliable information is not available industry wide graphite electrode manufacturing capacity utilization rate was approximately in graphite electrode price increases announced since september have been successfully implemented 
in february  we implemented graphite electrode price increases of per metric ton in europe  per metric ton in asia  the middle east  north africa and south america and per pound in the us in july  we implemented graphite electrode price increases in the following regions south africa  to an average price range of  to  per metric ton  asia except china and the middle east of per metric ton  and north and south america  to  per metric ton  effective august  in september  we announced additional graphite electrode price increases in europe of per metric ton 
demand for cathodes in excluding china decreased slightly from because of reduced construction of new aluminum smelters 
we operated our cathode manufacturing capacity at relatively high operating levels in demand for refractories was strong in as a result of our increased penetration of various markets  including europe and china  and increased blast furnace construction and refurbishment 
weak economic conditions resulted in relatively low demand and weak pricing in for most of our other products 
outlook 
we believe that we are well positioned to increase earnings and cash flow from operations excluding payments in connection with restructurings  investigations  lawsuits and claims and the impact of the reduction of factoring of accounts receivable as described under liquidity and capital resources under current and improving global and regional economic conditions 
we expect net sales of all our products to increase by about in from synthetic graphite 
the graphite electrode supply demand balance has improved  and supply remains tight primarily due to graphite electrode industry wide rationalization  including bankruptcies of competitors  and  to a lesser extent  increased electric arc furnace steel production 
since september  we have successfully implemented graphite electrode price increases around the world as described above 
in february  we announced graphite electrode price increases of per metric ton in north and south america bringing the spot price to  per metric ton and per metric ton in europe  russia and the other countries in the community of independent states  the middle east  africa and asia 
these price increases are driven by continued upward pressure on energy and raw material costs  strength in steel production and the tight supply demand balance in the graphite electrode industry 
as the majority of our graphite electrode order book has been placed  this recent price increase is expected to impact less than of our business 
for  we continue to fill our graphite electrode order book and expect average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes to be approximately  for this represents an increase of approximately over the average for  an estimated one quarter of which is associated with expected benefits from net changes in currency exchange rates 
we expect graphite electrode sales volume for to be approximately  metric tons 
we expect demand for our cathodes in to be similar to our strategic alliance with pechiney  which is a owner of our cathode business and purchases cathodes from us under a requirements contract that remains in effect through  continues to position us as the leading supplier of cathodes to the aluminum industry 
operation of our synthetic graphite facilities at capacity is expected to positively impact synthetic graphite cost of sales in as compared to  offset by higher energy  freight and other raw material costs and the negative impact of net changes in currency exchange rates on costs 
in addition  we expect to benefit from our rationalization and other initiatives that allow us to achieve significant increases in productivity and output from our existing assets  including economies of scale and other cost savings that we believe will increase as we grow our sales 
other 
we expect growing net sales of our electronic thermal management products and services  due to our continuing successful product development and commercialization initiatives  the development of new  higher performance electronic devices and the strengthening economic condition of the electronics industry 
we have developed new electronic thermal management technologies with over product approvals from industry leading strategic partners  customers and others 
sales of our products are growing  from about  in to million in and an estimated million in we expect financial performance of most of our other businesses to improve from the current levels primarily due to the recovery of economic conditions in the end markets for their products 
in particular  demand for carbon electrodes in the us and demand for advanced synthetic graphite products used in the semiconductor  telecommunications and electronics industries is strengthening 
in addition  demand for our refractories has strengthened as a result of our increased penetration of various markets  particularly europe and china  and increased blast furnace construction and refurbishment 
we continue to seek to drive productivity and cost improvements in all of these businesses 
at december   after giving effect to the sale of the debentures and application of the net proceeds therefrom to repay the remaining million of term loans outstanding under the senior facilities and to make a provisional payment of million to the eu competition authority toward the eu antitrust fine  we would have had total debt of million including unamortized bond premium and fair value of hedged debt obligation cash and cash equivalents of million and a stockholders deficit of million 
we continue to implement interest rate management initiatives to seek to minimize interest expense and optimize the risk in our portfolio of fixed and variable interest rate obligations as described under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s in this report 
we are targeting interest expense of approximately million for as a result of  among other things  the successful completion of the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries  we are targeting an effective income tax rate of for our outlook could be significantly impacted by  among other things  changes in interest rates by the us federal reserve board and the european central bank  changes in tax laws and tax and fiscal policies by the us and other governments  developments in the middle east  the occurrence of further terrorist acts and developments including increases in security  insurance  data back up  energy and transportation and other costs  transportation delays and continuing or increased economic uncertainty and weakness resulting from terrorist acts and the war on terrorism  and other factors mentioned elsewhere in this report 
financing transactions in july  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds from that offering were million 
of the net proceeds were used to repay term loans outstanding under the senior facilities 
in february  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes at a price of of principal amount 
in may  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of additional senior notes at a price of of principal amount  plus accrued interest from february the senior notes bear interest at an annual rate of and mature in the net proceeds from the offering completed in february were million 
the net proceeds excluding accrued interest paid by the purchasers of the senior notes from the offering completed in may were million 
we used all of the net proceeds to reduce the balance outstanding under the revolving facility and to repay term loans outstanding under the senior facilities 
we paid approximately million of debt issuance costs related to the senior notes sold in february and million related to the senior notes sold in may these costs are being amortized over the term of the senior notes 
the million premium received upon issuance of the additional senior notes issued in may is classified as long term liability on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized as a credit to interest expense over the term of the additional senior notes 
as a result of our receipt of such premium  the effective annual interest rate on the additional senior notes is about 
we recorded an extraordinary charge of million million  net of tax in for write off of capitalized fees associated with the term loans repaid with the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes 
these extraordinary charges have been reclassified and included in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations  in accordance with sfas no 
relating to sfas no 
during  we exchanged million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  plus accrued interest of million  for approximately million shares of our common stock and we purchased million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  plus accrued interest  for million in cash 
in october  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in a registered public offering at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds from this offering were approximately million  of which million was used to repay term loans outstanding under the senior facilities  million was used to reduce the balance outstanding under the revolving facility  and the balance was used to repay other short term debt 
in connection therewith  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of capitalized fees associated with the term loans repaid with the net proceeds 
the write off has been included in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations 
on january   we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of debentures at a price of of principal amount 
the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
we used the net proceeds to repay the remaining million of term loans outstanding under the senior facilities and to make a provisional payment of million to the eu competition authority against the eu antitrust fine 
we intend to use the balance for general corporate purposes  including replacement of financing previously provided by factoring of accounts receivable and strategic acquisitions that are complementary to our businesses 
pending use for a specific corporate purpose  we intend to initially use the net proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance under the revolving facility  if any  and  to the extent that at the time there is no such amount outstanding  to invest in short term  investment quality  interest bearing securities or deposits 
litigation against our former parent companies initiated by us in february  we commenced a lawsuit against our former parents  mitsubishi corporation and union carbide corporation  to recover certain payments made to them in connection with our leveraged equity recapitalization in january as well as certain unjust receipts by them from their investments in us and damages for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties owed to us by our former senior management in connection with illegal graphite electrode price fixing activities 
we are seeking to recover more than billion  including interest 
on january   the court granted the defendants motions to dismiss the lawsuits 
we have appealed this decision 
we expect to incur million to million for legal expenses to pursue this lawsuit from the date of filing the complaint through appeal and ultimately trial 
through december   we had incurred about million of these legal expenses 
this lawsuit is in its earliest stages  and the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit is subject to many uncertainties 
antitrust litigation against us since  we and other producers and distributors of graphite and carbon products have been subject to antitrust investigations by antitrust authorities in the us  the european union  canada  japan and korea 
in addition  civil antitrust lawsuits have been commenced and threatened against us and other producers and distributors of graphite and carbon products in the us  canada and elsewhere 
in april  gti pled guilty to a one count charge of violating us federal antitrust law in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes and was sentenced to pay a non interest bearing fine in the aggregate amount of million  payable in six annual installments 
the payment schedule has been revised periodically at our request 
the payment schedule for the million balance consists of quarterly payments ranging from million to million  payable from april through january beginning in  the doj may ask the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania to accelerate the payment schedule based on a change in our ability to make such payments 
interest will begin to accrue on the unpaid balance  commencing in april  at the statutory rate of interest then in effect 
at december   the statutory rate of interest was per annum 
accrued interest will be payable together with each quarterly payment 
of the million original aggregate amount  million is treated as a fine and million is treated as imputed interest for accounting purposes 
in january  the eu competition authority alleged that we and other producers violated european antitrust laws in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes 
in july  the eu competition authority assessed a fine of million million  based on currency exchange rates in effect at december  against us 
this decision established the maximum obligation with respect to our last major remaining antitrust liability 
after an in depth analysis of the decision  in october  we filed an appeal to the court challenging  among other things  the amount of the eu antitrust fine  including the accrual of interest and the rate thereof 
the court has not yet issued its decision 
appeals of this type may take two years or longer to be decided 
under its decision  the eu competition authority stated that  until paid including a provisional payment described below  the eu antitrust fine would accrue interest at the statutory rate of per annum  commencing october  provided  however  that if a letter of credit  sufficient to secure payment of both the fine and interest accrued and accruing thereon  was provided to the eu competition authority  then the rate of interest would be per annum 
since the filing of our appeal in october through september  we negotiated with the eu competition authority regarding the appropriate form of collateral security for the eu antitrust fine during the pendency of our appeal 
in september  we filed an interim appeal to the court to waive the requirement for provisional payment of the eu antitrust fine or delivery of a letter of credit as collateral security for payment thereof or to allow us to provide alternative security for payment during the period prior to the court s decision on our appeal 
we withdrew the interim appeal after we posted the provisional payment described below 
in february  we used net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the debentures to post a provisional payment of million to the eu competition authority against the eu antitrust fine 
the provisional payment included million for accrued interest for the period from october to the date of the provisional payment at the rate of per annum 
the eu competition authority has advised us that its position is that the provisional payment should have included accrued interest at the rate of per annum 
we have advised the eu competition authority that we disagree with its position and will file an interim appeal challenging its position  if necessary 
a provisional payment constitutes the furnishing of cash collateral intended to secure payment to the eu competition authority of a fine and any interest thereon that is ultimately determined to be due  is not an admission of or acquiescence to any liability and will not prejudice our appeal challenging  among other things  the amount of the eu antitrust fine 
we will earn interest on the amount paid at an annual rate of until the court s decision on our appeal is issued and becomes final 
such payment does not reflect a change in our assessment of the outcome of our appeal 
in the second quarter  we became aware that the brazilian antitrust authority had requested written information from various steelmakers in brazil 
in april  our brazilian subsidiary received a request for information from that authority 
we have provided that information 
except as described above  the antitrust investigations against us in the us  canada  the european union  japan and korea with respect to graphite electrodes and in the european union with respect to isostatic and extruded specialty graphite have been resolved 
under plea agreements in the us and canada  we will not be subject to prosecution by the respective antitrust authorities with respect to any other violations of their respective antitrust laws occurring prior to the date of the applicable plea agreement in connection with the sale of graphite and carbon products 
all payments due have been timely paid 
it is possible that antitrust investigations seeking  among other things  to impose fines and penalties could be initiated against us by antitrust authorities in brazil or other jurisdictions 
we have settled  among other things  virtually all of the actual and potential claims against us by customers in the us and canada arising out of alleged antitrust violations occurring prior to the date of the relevant settlement in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes 
all settlement payments due have been timely paid 
none of the settlements or plea agreements contain restrictions on future prices of our graphite electrodes 
there remain  however  certain pending claims as well as pending lawsuits in the us relating to the sale of graphite electrodes sold to foreign customers 
it is also possible that additional antitrust lawsuits and claims could be asserted against us in the us or other jurisdictions 
we have recorded pretax charges of million against results of operations as a reserve for potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
the charges of million are calculated on a basis that i excludes  among other things  both actual and imputed interest on the doj antitrust fine and actual interest  if any  on the eu antitrust fine after the court s decision on our appeal is issued and becomes final and ii includes  among other things  the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on the euro denominated eu antitrust fine and interest accrued or to accrue on the eu antitrust fine prior to the time the court s decision on our appeal is issued and becomes final 
despite the fact that a provisional payment of a fine is only provisional under european law  generally accepted accounting principles require a charge to be recorded to cover the full amount of the provisional payment  to the extent that payment was not already covered by a reserve 
in connection with our provisional payment  we recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter  which increased our reserve from million to million 
to the extent that aggregate liabilities and expenses  net  are known or reasonably estimable  as of december   million represents our estimate of these liabilities and expenses 
the guilty pleas and the decisions by the antitrust authorities make it more difficult to defend against other investigations  lawsuits and claims 
we believe that the amount of the eu antitrust fine will be reduced on appeal 
to the extent that the actual amount of the eu antitrust fine after all appeals and including any interest thereon is less than the amount so provisionally paid  any excess would be refunded to us 
to the extent that such actual amount exceeds the amount so provisionally paid  we will be required to make an additional payment equal to such excess 
such additional payment may require us to record an additional charge 
through december   we paid an aggregate of million of fines and net settlements and expenses of which million has been applied against the reserve and million of imputed interest which is described below has not been applied against the reserve 
in the aggregate  the fines and net settlements and expenses are within the amounts we used to evaluate the aggregate charges of million 
our insurance has not and will not materially cover liabilities that have or may become due in connection with antitrust investigations or related lawsuits or claims 
at december   after giving effect to the provisional payment  million remained in the reserve 
the remaining amount of the reserve is unfunded 
such remaining amount is available for the doj antitrust fine and other matters 
the reserve does not cover interest on the doj antitrust fine including interest that  for accounting purposes  is imputed on the doj antitrust fine for the period during which it is non interest bearing 
such interest is recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
interest accruing on the eu antitrust fine  if any  after the date of the court s decision on our appeal will be recorded in interest expense 
actual aggregate liabilities and expenses including settled investigations  lawsuits and claims as well as continuing investigations  pending appeals and unsettled pending  threatened and possible lawsuits and claims mentioned above could be materially higher than million and the timing of payment thereof could be sooner than anticipated 
customer base we are a global company and serve all major geographic markets 
sales of our products to customers outside the us accounted for about of our net sales in  of our net sales in  and of our net sales in our customer base includes both steel and non steel producers 
in  two of our ten largest customers were purchasers of non graphite electrode products 
in  three of our ten largest customers were based in europe  two were in the us  two were in south africa and one was based in brazil 
no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounted for more than of our net sales in results of operations financial information discussed below omits our non strategic composite tooling business that was sold in june and has been accounted for as discontinued operations 
the results of our discontinued operations were not material to our consolidated results of operations 
compared to net sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from net sales of million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher net sales in our synthetic graphite and advanced carbon materials lines of business 
cost of sales of million in represented an million  or  increase from cost of sales of million in the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the higher sales volumes 
gross profit of million in represented a increase from gross profit of million in gross margin increased to of net sales in from in synthetic graphite segment 
net sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from net sales of million in  primarily due to higher sales volume of graphite electrodes and higher average graphite electrode sales revenue per metric ton 
volume of graphite electrodes sold was  metric tons in as compared to  metric tons in the higher volume of graphite electrodes sold represented an increase of million in net sales 
the increase was a result of stronger demand for graphite electrodes primarily in the united states and europe 
average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes in was  as compared to the average in of  the higher average sales revenue per metric ton represented an increase of million in net sales 
the increase was primarily due to net changes in currency exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  increases in graphite electrode prices 
net sales of cathodes increased in by  or million  from net sales of million in the increase was primarily due to the net positive impact of changes in currency exchange rates  partially offset by lower sales volume and lower average sales price 
cost of sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from cost of sales of million in  primarily due to the higher sales volume of graphite electrodes 
gross profit in was million  or or million higher than in the increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher graphite electrode net sales  and improved productivity from higher operating levels throughout the production network and the net positive impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
these improvements were partially offset primarily by higher freight  higher energy and other raw materials costs 
gross margin was of net sales in  higher than the of net sales in other segment 
net sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from net sales of million in  primarily due to higher volume of refractories sold by our advanced carbon materials line of business 
cost of sales of million in represented an million  or  increase from cost of sales of million in the increase in cost of sales was primarily related to higher sales volume in our advanced carbon materials line of business  higher energy costs and changes in product mix  partially offset by improved productivity from higher operating levels 
gross profit in was million a gross margin of of net sales as compared to gross profit in of million a gross margin of of net sales 
items affecting us as a whole 
research and development was million in  a decrease of million from the decrease was primarily due to cost savings resulting from our voluntary and selective severance programs 
selling  administrative and other expenses were million in  an increase of million from in  we recorded higher variable incentive compensation expense and incurred higher costs from continued strengthening of the euro in and the continued implementation of global work process changes and information systems 
these higher costs were partially offset by cost savings from our voluntary and selective severance programs 
in addition  in  we benefited from a one time reduction in franchise and other taxes associated with the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries 
other income expense  net  was income of million in  primarily due to currency exchange benefits of million  which were primarily associated with euro denominated intercompany loans 
these benefits were partially offset by other expenses  including primarily million for bank fees  including losses on sales of accounts receivable  a million non cash write down of fixed assets  million for employee benefit curtailment and related costs  million for non income taxes in brazil and switzerland  million associated with the write off of capitalized bank fees and related debt extinguishment costs and a million charge associated with mark to market adjustments on interest rate caps 
other income expense  net  was net income of million in  primarily due to currency exchange benefits of million which were associated with euro denominated intercompany loans 
these benefits were partially offset by other expenses  including primarily million for bank fees  including losses on sales of accounts receivable  million in legal expenses and settlements and million associated with the curtailment of employee benefit plans 
we recorded million of restructuring charges in  consisting of million for organizational changes and million for the closure and settlement of our us non qualified defined benefit plan for the participating salaried workforce 
the million charge for organizational changes related to us voluntary and selective severance programs and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction of employees 
the closure of our non qualified us defined benefit plan resulted in recognition of net actuarial losses of million 
approximately half of the million will involve cash outlays 
we recorded million of restructuring charges in the charges related primarily to the mothballing of graphite electrode manufacturing operations in italy 
this charge included estimated pension  severance and other related employee benefit costs for employees and other cost related to the mothballing 
at the end of  we announced the permanent closure of the majority of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in italy 
in the next twelve to eighteen months  we may record additional restructuring charges and incur additional exit costs in connection with such closure 
it is also possible that we may  at any time  decide to permanently shut down our remaining graphite electrode operations in italy 
in such event  we may record additional restructuring charges and incur additional exit costs 
we recorded a million impairment loss on long lived and other assets relating to the remaining fixed assets at our graphite electrode manufacturing facility in italy in connection with such closure 
in  we sold land in clarksville  tennessee and received net proceeds of million 
we recorded a million net non cash write off of the remaining book value of assets at this site 
in  we recorded a million impairment loss on our long lived carbon electrode assets in columbia  tennessee  a million impairment loss on our investment in our joint venture with jilin and a million impairment loss on available for sale securities 
we recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter relating to the eu antitrust fine 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in average total debt outstanding was million in as compared to million in the average annual interest rate was in as compared to in these average annual rates include million of interest rate benefit from our interest rate swaps  but exclude imputed interest on the doj antitrust fine  million of amortization of the net proceeds of million with respect to the sale of swaps and million credit to interest expense from the acceleration of the amortization of gains realized from the sale of interest rate swaps due to the early extinguishment of debt from our exchanges of common stock for senior notes during provision for income taxes was a charge of million in as compared to a benefit of million in the effective income tax rate was not meaningful in because we incurred income tax expense of million even though we recognized a loss from continuing operations of million  primarily due to tax expense of million associated with non deductible antitrust related charges and an additional million from adjustments increasing the deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
the effective income tax rate was a benefit of in  primarily due to higher state tax benefits of million and certain other benefits of million primarily associated with the impact of impairment losses on long lived and other assets and restructuring charges  partially offset by tax expense of million from adjustments increasing the deferred tax asset valuation allowances and million from the impact of dividends of foreign earnings 
the effective income tax rate was in and about in  in each case excluding the impact of impairment losses on long lived and other assets  restructuring charges and the charge related to the eu antitrust fine 
during  we recorded a million gain from the sale of our non strategic composite tooling business 
the discontinued business recorded a net income from operations of million in and as a result of the changes described above  net loss was million in as compared to net loss of million in compared to net sales in were million  a decrease of million  or  from net sales in of million 
gross profit in was million  a decrease of million  or  from gross profit in of million 
gross profit margin in was of net sales as compared to gross profit margin in of of net sales 
the decrease in net sales and gross profit was primarily due to lower sales revenue per metric ton for our graphite electrodes  which reduced net sales by about million 
synthetic graphite segment 
net sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes  partially offset by higher sales volumes for graphite electrodes and cathodes sold 
the volume of graphite electrodes sold increased  metric tons  or  to  metric tons in as compared to  metric tons in the increase in volume of graphite electrodes sold represented an increase in net sales of about million 
the average sales revenue per metric ton in us dollars and net changes in currency exchange rates of our graphite electrodes was  in as compared to  in the reduced average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes represented a decrease of about million in net sales 
unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates represented a reduction of about million in net sales of graphite electrodes 
volume of cathodes sold in was higher than in  with  metric tons in as compared to  metric tons in  and net sales of cathodes in were higher than in we completed the expansion of our cathode manufacturing capacity in brazil in and were successful in selling virtually all of our cathode manufacturing capacity for synthetic graphite segment cost of sales increased  or million  to million in from million in the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher volume of graphite electrodes sold  partially offset by lower average graphite electrode cost of sales per metric ton 
the reduction in average graphite electrode cost of sales per metric ton was primarily due to cost savings initiatives and lower average fixed cost per metric ton due to facility closures and  to lesser extent  net changes in currency exchange rates 
gross profit decreased  or million  to million of net sales in from million of net sales in other segment 
net sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in we had lower net sales in each of our product lines  especially in advanced carbon materials due to a cyclical decrease in the volume of refractories sold and in flexible graphite due to lower sales of sealing products sold to the transportation industry 
cost of sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decline was primarily due to lower volume of products sold 
gross profit decreased  or million  to million of net sales in from million of net sales in other items affecting us as a whole 
selling  administrative and other expense increased by million to million in from million in in  we recorded a million charge related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock 
other expense income  net  was million of income in as compared to million of expense in we recorded both other income and other expense in both periods resulting from various non operational activities  including gains from currency transactions and translation 
in  we had million in currency gains  million of which gain was due to currency translation on intercompany loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency and million of which related to transactions with third parties 
these gains were partially offset by other expenses  including primarily million for bank fees resulting partially from losses on sales of accounts receivable  million in legal expenses and settlements  million in corporate realignment and related expenses and million associated with the curtailment of employee benefit plans 
in  we recorded a total of million in impairment losses and restructuring charges as described below o in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million million after tax charge relating to the impairment of our investment in our joint venture with jilin 
this impairment resulted from uncertainty about the completion and start up of the joint venture facilities in china due to the effects that the challenging graphite electrode industry conditions had on jilin 
o in the second and third quarters  we recorded a total of million of charges related to the impairment of available for sale securities 
o in the second quarter  we recorded a million million after tax charge primarily related to the impairment of our long lived carbon electrode assets in columbia  tennessee 
o in the first and fourth quarter  we recorded a total of million of restructuring charges related primarily to the mothballing of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in caserta  italy 
these charges included estimated pension  severance and other related employee benefit costs 
in  we recorded a total of million  net  in impairment losses and restructuring charges as described below o in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million restructuring charge and a million impairment loss on long lived and other assets 
the restructuring charge related primarily to exit costs related to the mothballing of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in caserta  italy 
million of the impairment loss on long lived assets related to assets located at our facility in caserta  italy 
the remaining million related to the impairment of available for sale securities 
o in the third quarter  we recorded a million restructuring charge related to a corporate realignment of our businesses  the relocation of our corporate headquarters and the shutdown of our coal calcining operations located in niagara falls  new york 
the charge includes severance and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction of employees and impairment of leasehold improvement assets 
o in third quarter  we reversed million of prior restructuring charges based on revised lower estimates of workforce reductions and plant closure costs  and we reclassified million of prior restructuring charges related to on site waste disposal post monitoring costs to other long term obligations 
o in the second quarter  we recorded a million charge for restructuring and impairment loss on long lived assets related to the shutdown of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in clarksville and columbia  tennessee and our coal calcining operations in niagara falls  new york 
the million charge includes restructuring charges of million for severance and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction of employees and million in plant shutdown and related costs 
the remaining million relates to the impairment loss on long lived assets 
in addition  in  we recorded a million charge for additional potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations 
interest expense was stable at million in each of and our average outstanding total debt was million in as compared to million in and our average annual interest rate was in as compared to in these average annual interest rates exclude imputed interest on antitrust fines  which decreased million to million in from million in benefit from income taxes was million in as compared to provision for income taxes of million for the effective income tax rate was a benefit of in  primarily due to higher state tax benefits of million and certain other benefits of million primarily associated with the impact of impairment losses on long lived and other assets and restructuring charges  partially offset by tax expense of million from adjustments increasing the deferred tax asset valuation allowances and million from the impact of dividends of foreign earnings 
during  the benefit from and provision for income taxes reflected an effective rate of about  excluding the impact of impairment losses on long lived and other assets  restructuring charges  the charge related to antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims  and the charge related to the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries 
as a result of the changes described above  net loss was million in  an improvement of million from net loss of million in effects of inflation we incur costs in the us and each of the six us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility 
in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by the effects of inflation on our costs incurred in each of these countries 
see currency translation and transactions for a further discussion of highly inflationary countries 
during the past three years  we experienced higher freight  energy and other raw material costs primarily due to substantial increases in regional and worldwide market prices of natural gas and other petroleum based raw materials 
we have been able to generally mitigate the effects of those increases on our cost of sales by a combination of improved operating efficiency and on going cost savings 
in addition  during  we mitigated seasonal increases in our natural gas costs by entering into short duration fixed rate purchase contracts with certain of our north american suppliers 
these contracts expire at the end of the first quarter 
in addition  we have entered into natural gas hedge contracts  effectively fixing of our direct and indirect natural gas cost exposure in north america of direct worldwide exposure through april except as described above  we did not experience significant inflation with respect to our costs 
we cannot assure you that future increases in our costs will not occur or exceed the rate of inflation or the amounts  if any  by which we may be able to increase prices for our products 
currency translation and transactions we account for our non us subsidiaries under sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
accordingly  except for highly inflationary countries  the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes 
foreign currency translation adjustments are generally recorded as part of stockholders equity and identified as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until such time as their operations are sold or substantially or completely liquidated 
we have subsidiaries in russia  mexico  brazil and other countries which have had in the past  and may have now or in the future  highly inflationary economies  defined as cumulative inflation of about or more over a period of three calendar years 
in general  the financial statements of foreign operations in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency of their economic environments were the dollar and translation gains and losses relating to these foreign operations are included in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations rather than as part of stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets 
we also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses as part of other income expense  net 
we account for our mexican subsidiary using the dollar as its functional currency  irrespective of mexico s inflationary status  because its sales and purchases are predominantly dollar denominated 
in addition  we account for our russian subsidiary using the dollar as its functional currency because russia is considered to have a highly inflationary economy 
significant changes in currency exchange rates impacting us are described under effects of changes in currency exchange rates 
foreign currency translation adjustments decreased stockholders equity by million  including million associated with our south african subsidiary  in and million  including million associated with our brazilian subsidiary  in these adjustments increased stockholders equity by million in effects of changes in currency exchange rates we incur costs in dollars and the currency of each of the six non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility  and we sell our products in multiple currencies 
in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by changes in currency exchange rates affecting these currencies relative to the dollar and  to a limited extent  each other 
when the currencies of non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility decline or increase in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of reducing or increasing the dollar equivalent cost of sales and other expenses with respect to those facilities 
this effect is  however  partially offset by the cost of petroleum coke  a principal raw material used by us  which is priced in dollars 
in certain countries where we have manufacturing facilities  and in certain instances where we price our products for sale in export markets  we sell in currencies other than the dollar 
accordingly  when these currencies increase or decline in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of increasing or reducing net sales 
the result of these effects is to increase or decrease operating profit and net income 
many of the non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility have been subject to significant economic pressures  which have impacted inflation and currency exchange rates 
we seek to mitigate adverse impacts of changes in currency exchange rates on net sales by increasing local currency prices for some of our products in various regions as circumstances permit 
during  the euro declined about  the brazilian real declined about and the south african rand declined about relative to the dollar 
during  the brazilian real declined about  the south african rand increased about and the euro increased about relative to the dollar 
during  the average exchange rate of the euro and the south african rand increased about and  respectively  when compared to the average exchange rate for during  the average exchange rate for the brazilian real and the mexican peso declined about and  respectively  when compared to the average exchange rate for in the case of net sales of graphite electrodes  the impact of these events was a reduction of about million in  a reduction of about million in and an increase of about million in in the case of cost of sales of graphite electrodes  the impact of these events was a reduction of about million in  a reduction of about million in and an increase of about million in we seek to mitigate adverse impacts of changes in currency exchange rates on net sales by increasing local currency prices for some of our products in various regions as circumstances permit 
we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates in the future or whether those changes will have net positive or negative impacts on our net sales  cost of sales or net income 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to mitigate any adverse effects of such changes 
we have non dollar denominated intercompany loans between graftech finance and some of our foreign subsidiaries 
at december   the aggregate principal amount of these loans was million based on currency exchange rates in effect at december  
these loans are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in currency exchange rates 
a portion of these loans are deemed to be essentially permanent and  as a result  translation gains and losses on these loans are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets 
the balance of these loans are deemed to be temporary and  as a result  translation gains and losses on these loans are recorded as unrealized gains or losses in other expense income  net  on the consolidated statements of operations 
we have the ability to replace each intercompany loan with an identical new intercompany loan 
when we replace such a loan  we record net cumulative realized translation gains or losses with respect to that loan in other expense income  net 
those realized gains or losses are  however  non cash gains or losses 
foreign currency translation gains and losses relating to these loans included in other income expense  net  were a loss of million in  a gain of million in and a gain of million in to manage certain exposures to specific financial market risks caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we use various financial instruments as described under item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of funds have consisted principally of invested capital  cash flow from operations and debt and equity financings 
our uses of those funds other than for operations have consisted principally of debt reduction  capital expenditures  payment of fines  liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims and payment of restructuring costs 
we are highly leveraged  and we have substantial obligations in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims 
at december   after giving effect to the issuance and sale of the debentures and initial application of the net proceeds therefrom to repay the remaining million of term loans outstanding under the senior facilities and to make a provisional payment of million to the eu competition authority toward the eu antitrust fine  we had total debt of million including unamortized bond premium and fair value of hedged debt obligation  cash and cash equivalents of million and a stockholders deficit of million 
in addition  we have historically discounted or factored a substantial portion of our accounts receivable and used the proceeds to reduce our debt 
if we had not sold such receivables  our accounts receivable and our debt would have been about million higher at december  we intend to reduce our factoring of accounts receivable and use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures to replace the financing previously provided by factoring of accounts receivable 
we use cash and cash equivalents  funds available under the revolving facility and cash flow from operations as our primary sources of liquidity 
availability of funds under the revolving facility is subject to continued compliance with the financial covenants under the senior facilities 
at december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the senior facilities and had no outstanding balance under the revolving facility with million after consideration of outstanding letters of credit and at currency exchange rates in effect at december  fully available 
at december   after giving effect to the issuance and sale of the debentures and initial application of the net proceeds therefrom to repay the remaining million of term loans outstanding under the senior facilities and to make a provisional payment of million to the eu competition authority toward the eu antitrust fine  or million of our total debt had effectively been converted to variable rate obligations 
at december   we also had interest rate caps for a total notional amount of million through august these instruments effectively cap our interest rate exposure represented by the net impact of our swaps on the senior notes to no greater than basis points above the six month libor rate of basis points at december  deleveraging actions 
we completed over million in de leveraging actions in these actions consisted of sales of non strategic assets that generated net proceeds of million  including the sale of our non strategic composite tooling business for million which includes a working capital adjustment of million  the sale of interest rate swaps for net cash proceeds of million  the exchange of common stock for million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  plus accrued interest  and the public offering of shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
virtually all of such proceeds were used to reduce debt 
long term contractual  commercial and other obligations and commitments

the first preceding table includes our reserve for estimated liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims  which includes the eu antitrust fine of million 
the timing of payment of the eu antitrust fine is  for purposes of this table  reflected in the column captioned payments due during year ending december on the line entitled estimated liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
in february  we made a provisional payment of million to the eu competition authority against the eu antitrust fine 
while we cannot assure you that such will be the case  we believe the amount of the eu antitrust fine will be reduced on appeal 
to the extent that the actual amount of the eu antitrust fine after all appeals and including any interest thereon is less than the amount so provisionally paid  any excess would be refunded to us 
to the extent that such actual amount exceeds the amount so provisionally paid  we will be required to make an additional payment equal to such excess 
effective april  we entered into a ten year service contract with cgi valued at million million of which is the unconditional purchase obligation at december  
pursuant to this contract  cgi provides a majority of our global information technology service requirements 
we are dependent on cgi for these services 
a failure by cgi to provide these services to us in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations 
the first preceding table includes a line entitled unconditional purchase obligations that includes the minimum purchases under that contract 
in september  we entered into a ten year outsourcing contract with cgi to provide finance and accounting business process services valued at million 
that contract does not constitute an unconditional purchase obligation and therefore is not included in the first preceding table 
the second preceding table includes a line entitled lines of credit 
these are local lines of credit established by our foreign subsidiaries for working capital purposes and are not part of our revolving credit facility 
our pension benefit obligations were underfunded by about million at december  as compared to about million at december  this decrease in underfunding was primarily due to contributions in cash and in shares of our common stock made by us and the increase in asset values resulting from the returns on invested assets in cash flow and plans to manage liquidity 
as a result of our significant leverage  our substantial obligations in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims  and our substantial other long term contractual and commercial obligations and commitments  we have placed high priority on efforts to manage cash  generate additional cash flow and reduce debt 
our longer term efforts include our major cost savings plan  our major cost savings plan and our other cost savings activities  our strategic alliances and our financing activities 
our shorter term efforts include our interest rate management and working capital initiatives 
during the four years prior to  we had positive annual cash flow from operations  excluding payments in connection with restructurings and investigations  lawsuits and claims 
typically  the first quarter of each year resulted in neutral or negative cash flow from operations excluding payments in connection with restructurings  antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims and the impact of the reduction of factoring of accounts receivable due to various factors 
these factors included customer order patterns  customer buy ins in advance of annual price increases  fluctuations in working capital requirements and payment of variable compensation with respect to the immediately preceding year 
typically  the other three quarters resulted in positive cash flow from operations before such exclusions 
the third quarter tended to produce relatively less positive cash flow primarily as a result of scheduled plant shutdowns by our customers for vacations 
our cash flow from operations before such exclusions in the first and third quarters typically is adversely impacted by the semi annual interest payments on the senior notes and will be further impacted by the semi annual interest payments on the debentures beginning in july the second and fourth quarters correspondingly benefit from the absence of such interest payments 
as part of our cash management activities  we seek to manage accounts receivable credit risk  collections  and accounts payable and payments thereof to seek to maximize our free cash at any given time and minimize accounts receivable losses 
in addition  we have historically discounted or factored a portion of our accounts receivable and used the proceeds to reduce our debt 
certain of our subsidiaries sold receivables totaling million in  million in and million in accounts receivable sold and remaining on the consolidated balance sheets was million at december  and nil at december  if we had not sold such receivables  our accounts receivable and our debt would have been about million higher at december  and million higher at december  when we sell receivables  we incur costs equal to approximately to of the amount of the receivables sold 
in addition  careful management of credit risk over at least the past three years has allowed us to avoid significant accounts receivable losses notwithstanding the poor financial condition of many of our potential and existing customers 
in order to seek to minimize our credit risks  we reduced our sales of  or refused to sell except for cash on delivery  graphite electrodes to some customers and potential customers in the us and  to a limited extent  elsewhere 
our unrecovered trade receivables worldwide was only of global net sales during this period 
we cannot assure you that we will not be materially adversely affected by accounts receivable losses in the future 
we currently intend to reduce factoring of accounts receivable and use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures to replace the financing previously provided by factoring of accounts receivable 
we use cash and cash equivalents  funds available under the revolving facility and cash flow from operations as our primary sources of liquidity 
we believe that our cost savings initiatives will  over the next one to two years  continue to improve our cash flow from operations for a given level of net sales 
improvements in cash flow from operations resulting from these initiatives are being partially offset by associated cash implementation costs  while they are being implemented 
we also believe that our planned sales of non strategic assets together with these improvements in cash flow from operations should allow us to reduce our debt and other obligations over the long term 
we may from time to time and at any time exchange or purchase senior notes in open market or privately negotiated transactions  opportunistically on terms that we believe to be favorable 
these exchanges or purchases may be effected for cash from cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under our revolving facility or new credit facilities  or proceeds from sale of debt or equity securities or assets  common stock or other equity or debt securities  or a combination thereof 
we may at any time and from time to time seek and obtain consent from the lenders under the senior facilities with respect to any restrictions thereunder applicable to such transactions 
we will evaluate any such transaction in light of then prevailing market conditions and our then current and prospective liquidity and capital resources  including projected and potential needs and prospects for access to capital markets 
any such transactions may  individually or in the aggregate  be material 
our significant leverage and substantial antitrust related and other obligations could have a material impact on our liquidity  reducing funds available to us for other purposes and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns or changes in the expected amount or timing of payment of these obligations 
our ability to service our debt as it comes due  including maintaining compliance with the financial covenants and the representations regarding absence of material adverse changes under the senior facilities  and to meet our debt service and other obligations as they come due is dependent on our future performance  which is subject to various factors  including certain factors beyond our control such as changes in conditions affecting our industry  changes in global and regional economic conditions  changes in interest and currency exchange rates  developments in antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims involving us and inflation in raw material  energy and other costs 
a failure to comply with such covenants  unless waived  would be a default under the senior facilities 
this would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the senior facilities and terminate their commitments to extend credit under the revolving facility 
an acceleration of maturity of the senior facilities would permit the holders of the senior notes to accelerate the maturity of the senior notes and the holders of the debentures to accelerate the maturity of the debentures 
if we were unable to repay our debt to the lenders and holders or otherwise obtain a waiver from the lenders and holders  the lenders and holders could proceed against the collateral securing the senior facilities and the senior notes  respectively  and exercise all other rights available to them  and we could be required to undertake significant actions which may be inconsistent with our plans or adverse to our stockholders to raise the funds necessary for repayment 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain any such waiver or take any of such actions on favorable terms or at all 
as described above  availability of funds under the revolving facility is subject to continuing compliance with the financial covenants under the senior facilities 
the senior facilities require us to  among other things  comply with financial covenants relating to specified minimum interest coverage and maximum net senior secured debt leverage ratios that become more restrictive over time 
at december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the senior facilities 
if we were to believe that we would not continue to comply with these covenants  we would seek an appropriate waiver or amendment from the lenders thereunder 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such waiver or amendment on acceptable terms or at all 
at december   the revolving facility provided for maximum borrowings of up to million million  based on currency exchange rates in effect at december  
it is possible that our future ability to borrow under the revolving facility could effectively be less because of the impact of additional borrowings upon our compliance with the maximum net senior secured debt leverage ratio permitted or minimum interest coverage ratio required under the senior facilities 
at december   we had no outstanding balance under the revolving facility and million after consideration of outstanding letters of credit and at currency exchange rates in effect at december  fully available thereunder 
we believe that the long term fundamentals of our business continue to be sound 
accordingly  although we cannot assure you that such will be the case  we believe that  based on our expected cash flow from operations  our expected resolution of our remaining obligations in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims  and our existing capital resources  and taking into account our working capital needs and our efforts to reduce costs  improve efficiencies and product quality  generate growth and cash flow and maximize funds available to meet our debt service and other obligations  we will be able to manage our liquidity to permit us to service our debt and meet our obligations when due 
related party transactions 
we have not  since january   engaged in or been a party to any material transactions with affiliates or related parties other than transactions with our subsidiaries including carbone savoie and aet  compensatory transactions including employee benefits  stock option and restricted stock grants  compensation deferral and executive employee loans and stock purchases with directors or officers  and transactions with our owned joint venture with jilin in china

cash flows 
in general  during  and  we used cash in operating activities including restructuring and antitrust related payments as well as for capital expenditures 
financing for these uses was provided primarily by net proceeds from our public offerings of common stock in and  our incurrence of long term and short term debt  and proceeds from sales of non strategic assets and interest rate swaps 
we believe that we will have net cash provided by operating activities in excluding payments related to restructurings  antitrust fines and the impact of the reduction of factoring of accounts receivables 
we expect to make payments of about million related to restructurings  about milion related to antitrust fines and about million related to replacement of financing that would have been provided by factoring of accounts receivable 
we expect that we will have net cash used in operating activities in including such exclusions 
cash flow used in provided by operating activities 
cash flow used in operating activities was million in as compared to million in  an improvement of million 
cash flow used in operating activities was million in as compared to cash flow provided by operating activities of million in  a decline of million 
cash used in operating activities was million in the primary uses consisted of million for working capital and million use for other liabilities offset by a source of cash of million from the net loss  after adding back the net effect from non cash items 
working capital uses related to decreases in payables from timing of payment patterns and increases in inventories to support anticipated customer demand 
other liability uses were primarily for pension and postretirement benefits 
non cash charges consisted of million related to antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims  million of depreciation amortization  million of restructuring charges and impairment losses  offset by other non cash credits of million related primarily to currency exchange gains on euro denominated intercompany loans

working capital uses primarily related to million relating to the mothballing of our italian graphite electrode manufacturing operations  the shutdown of our us graphite electrode manufacturing operations and the high level of accounts payable at december  other liability uses were primarily for pension and postretirement benefit payments and contributions 
non cash charges consisted of million of impairment losses and million of depreciation and amortization  offset by million of deferred tax credits and million relating primarily to currency exchange gains on euro denominated intercompany loans 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million in sources resulted primarily from income from continuing operations and an increase in working capital 
net income after excluding the net effect from non cash items was million in working capital decreased million in  primarily due to a million increase in inventories  an million increase in restructuring payments  and million in payments for antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims  partially offset by a million reduction in accounts and notes receivables 
cash flow used in investing activities 
cash flow used in investing activities was million in as compared to million in and million in virtually all of such investing activities consisted of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in were million  in were million and in were million 
capital expenditures in related primarily to the expansion of graphite electrode manufacturing capacity  implementation of jd edwards information systems and essential capital maintenance 
in  million of cash was provided to investing activities  primarily from the sale of our non strategic composite tooling business for million including a million working capital adjustment 
we used million of cash flow in investing activities during as compared to million during capital expenditures in related primarily to expansion of graphite electrode manufacturing capacity in mexico  expansion of cathode manufacturing capacity in france  jd edwards system implementation and essential maintenance 
in  we limited capital expenditures to installation of our advanced natural graphite production lines  and similar critical or strategic capital investments and essential maintenance 
cash flow provided by financing activities 
cash flow provided by financing activities was million during  million in and million in during  we received net proceeds of million from the registered public offering of common stock and million from the sale of interest rate swaps 
we used these proceeds primarily to repay term loans of million outstanding under the senior facilities  reduce the outstanding balance under the revolving facility and repay other short term debt 
cash flow provided by financing activities during was primarily attributable to million of proceeds from our sale of million of senior notes in  of which million was used to repay other long term debt  million was used to repay borrowings under the revolving facility and million was used to pay financing costs 
in addition  we received million from the sale of interest rate swaps 
during  we received net proceeds of million  primarily from our public offering of common stock in july we also received million from an additional minority investment in connection with the broadening of our strategic alliance in the cathode business with pechiney  and made million in debt repayments 
restrictions on dividends and stock repurchases under the senior facilities  we are generally permitted to pay dividends on our common stock and repurchase our common stock in an aggregate annual amount of between million and million  depending on our leverage ratio and excess cash flow 
under the senior notes  we are generally permitted to pay dividends on our common stock and repurchase our common stock in an aggregate cumulative from february  amount of million  plus certain consolidated net income  equity proceeds and investment gains 
under the debentures  dividends on our common stock and repurchases of our common stock may result in adjustments to the conversion rate applicable to the debentures 
costs relating to protection of the environment we have been and are subject to increasingly stringent environmental protection laws and regulations 
in addition  we have an on going commitment to rigorous internal environmental protection standards 
environmental considerations are part of all significant capital expenditure decisions 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding environmental expenses and capital expenditures 
for the year ended december  dollars in millions expenses relating to environmental protection capital expenditures related to environmental protection critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that require difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
however  the following accounting policies could be deemed to be critical 
reliance on estimates 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we use and rely on estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for restructuring charges and contingencies  tax valuation allowances  evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and post retirement benefit obligations and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
estimates require us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our estimates for these matters are reasonable  if the actual amount is significantly different than the estimated amount  our assets  liabilities or results of operations may be overstated or understated 
employee benefit plans 
we sponsor various retirement and pension plans  including defined benefit  defined contribution plans and post retirement benefit plans that cover most employees worldwide 
accounting for these plans requires assumptions as to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  expected salary increases and health care cost trend rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on these rates and the effect of a change in these rates on our results of operations 
financial instruments 
we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
we routinely enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures to manage well defined currency exchange rate risks and interest rate risks 
these transactions relate primarily to financial instruments described under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
since the counterparties to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions  we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
accounting for financial instruments requires us to make judgments about the value of those instruments at specified dates 
while we believe that our estimates of values are reasonable  if the actual values are significantly different than the estimated values  our assets  liabilities or results of operations may be overstated or understated 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies by recording an estimated loss or gain from a loss or gain contingency when information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred or a gain has become receivable at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss or gain can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as those relating to environmental  legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss or gain from a contingency is significantly different from the estimated loss or gain  our results of operations may be overstated or understated 
impairments of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the discounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
if the actual value is significantly less than the estimated fair value  our assets may be overstated 
inventories 
we record the value of inventories at the lower of cost or market  and periodically review the book value of products and product lines to determine if they are properly valued 
we also periodically review the composition of our inventories and seek to identify slow moving inventories 
in connection with those reviews  we seek to identify products that may not be properly valued and assess the ability to dispose of them at a price greater than cost 
if it is determined that cost is less than market value  then cost is used for inventory valuation 
if a write down to current market value is necessary  the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value  sometimes called the ceiling defined as selling price less costs to complete and dispose  and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin  sometimes called the floor 
generally  we do not experience issues with obsolete inventory due to the nature of our products 
if the actual value is significantly less than the recorded value  our assets may be overstated 
accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to make the following assessments o estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction 
o estimate our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as lease revenue and related depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we include within our consolidated balance sheets 
o assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  if we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
if our estimates are incorrect  our assets or liabilities may be overstated or understated

description of senior facilities  senior notes and debentures 
a description of the senior facilities  the senior notes and the debentures is set forth under long term debt and liquidity in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report  and such description is incorporated herein by reference 
such description contains all of the information required with respect thereto 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commercial energy rates 
we routinely enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures to manage well defined risks 
these transactions relate primarily to financial instruments described below 
since the counterparties to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions  we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from floating rate long term debt tied to libor or euro libor 
our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates results primarily from o investments in and intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries and our share of the earnings of those subsidiaries  to the extent denominated in currencies other than local currencies  o raw material purchases made by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  and o export sales made by our subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies 
our exposure to changes in energy costs results primarily from the purchase of natural gas and electricity for use in our manufacturing operations 
interest rate management 
we implement interest rate management initiatives to seek to minimize our interest expense and optimize the risk in our portfolio of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
use of these initiatives is allowed under the senior notes and the senior facilities 
we have interest rate swaps that effectively convert fixed rate debt represented by the senior notes into variable rate debt in order to seek to minimize interest expense 
at december   we had swaps for a notional amount of million 
our interest rate swaps are designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of the related debt called a fair value hedge 
the related debt for our swaps is the senior notes 
our swaps are marked to market monthly  and we are required to provide cash collateral to the counterparty to the extent that the fair value of the derivative exceeds million  net of market value of our interest rate caps 
we may  at any time  exit our position in these swaps 
the fair value of the hedge at the end of a period is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets on the line entitled fair value of hedged debt obligation 
at december   the carrying value of our debt was reduced by million excluding the offsetting value of our interest rate caps of million as a result of our fair value hedge 
the interest rate swap derivative was valued at million at december  and is recorded as part of other long term obligations on the consolidated balance sheets 
when we sell swaps  the gain or loss realized is amortized as a credit or charge to interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes 
when we effectively reduce the outstanding principal amount of the senior notes through exchanges or otherwise  the related portion of such credit or charge is accelerated and recorded in the period in which such reduction occurs 
in the second quarter  we entered into million notional amount of swaps through the remaining term of the senior notes  effectively converting that amount of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
in the third quarter  we sold the entire million notional amount of swaps for million in cash 
in the fourth quarter  we entered into million notional amount of swaps through the remaining term of the senior notes 
interest rate swaps reduced our interest expense by million in the credits to interest expense for these periods due to amortization of the million proceeds for the sale of swaps was nominal 
at december   the carrying value of our debt was increased by million as a result of our fair value hedge 
the interest rate swap derivative was valued at million at december  and is recorded as part of other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
in the first quarter  we entered into an additional million notional amount of swaps bringing our total notional amount of swaps to million through the remaining term of the senior notes  effectively converting that amount of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
subsequently in the first quarter  we sold the entire million notional amount of swaps for million in cash 
following the sale of the swaps  in the first quarter  we entered into million notional amount of swaps through the remaining term of the senior notes 
subsequently  in the second quarter  we entered into an additional million notional amount of swaps bringing our total notional amount of swaps to million 
subsequently in the second quarter  we sold the total notional amount of million of swaps for million in cash 
in the third quarter  we entered into million notional amount of swaps for the remaining term of the senior notes 
subsequently in the third quarter  we sold million notional amount of swaps and paid million in cash 
as a result  at december   we held million notional amount of swaps for the remaining term of the senior notes 
interest rate swaps reduced our interest expense by approximately million in in  we realized net proceeds of million with respect to the sale of swaps  which will be amortized as a credit to interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes 
such amortization amounted to million for the year ended december  the credit to interest expense for due to the acceleration of the amortization of cash proceeds from the sale of swaps as a result of our exchanges of common stock for senior notes was million 
we enter into agreements with financial institutions that are intended to limit  or cap  our exposure to the incurrence of additional interest expense due to increases in variable interest rates 
in the first quarter  we entered into interest rate caps for a notional amount of million through august in the second quarter  we entered into additional interest rate caps for a notional amount of million through august bringing our total notional amount of caps to million through august 
these instruments effectively cap our interest rate exposure represented by the net impact of our swaps on the senior notes to no greater than basis points above the six month libor rate of basis points at december  all of our interest rate caps are marked to market monthly 
gains and losses are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations 
unrealized losses on caps amounted to million for currency rate management 
we enter into foreign currency instruments to attempt to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
these foreign currency instruments  which include  but are not limited to  forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options  attempt to hedge global currency exposures  net  relating to euro denominated debt and identifiable foreign currency receivables  payables and commitments held by our foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
forward exchange contracts are agreements to exchange different currencies at a specified future date and at a specified rate 
purchased foreign currency options are instruments which give the holder the right  but not the obligation  to exchange different currencies at a specified rate at a specified date or over a range of specified dates 
the result is the creation of a range in which a best and worst price is defined  while minimizing option cost 
forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options are carried at market value 
all of these contracts mature within one year and are marked to market monthly 
gains and losses due to the recording of such contracts at fair value are recognized currently in other expense income  net  on the consolidated statements of operations 
unrealized gains and losses on outstanding foreign currency contracts were nil at december   a loss of million at december  and nil at december  the notional amount of these contracts at december  was million and nil at december  in  we recorded a loss of million with respect to the instruments held during the course of the year 
we had no such contracts outstanding at december   however  we may at any time purchase further instruments 
commercial energy rate management 
we have entered into short duration fixed rate purchase contracts with certain of our north american natural gas suppliers in order to mitigate seasonal increases in our natural gas costs 
these contracts expire at the end of the first quarter 
in addition  we have entered into natural gas hedge contracts  effectively fixing of our direct and indirect natural gas cost exposure in north america of direct worldwide exposure through april sensitivity analysis 
we used a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential effect of changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates for  and based on this analysis  a hypothetical weakening or strengthening in the dollar across all other currencies would have changed our reported gross margin for by about million  by about million and by about million 
in addition  based on this analysis  a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points across all maturities would have increased our interest expense excluding the impact of any hypothetical interest rate swaps for  and by about million
