item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sifco industries  inc and its subsidiaries engage in the production and sale of a variety of metalworking processes  services and products produced primarily to the specific design requirements of its customers 
the processes and services include forging  heat treating  coating  welding  machining and selective electrochemical finishing 
the products include forgings  machined forged parts and other machined metal parts  remanufactured component parts for turbine engines  and selective electrochemical finishing solutions and equipment 
the company s operations are conducted in three business segments turbine component services and repair group  aerospace component manufacturing group  and metal finishing group 
a 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year fiscal net sales increased to million  compared with million in fiscal net loss for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal turbine component services and repair group repair group the repair group  which accounted for of the company s net sales in fiscal  had net sales of million  up from the million in fiscal turbine engine component manufacturing and repair net sales increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal demand for precision component machining and for component repairs for industrial turbine engines and large aerospace turbine engines increased  while the demand for component repairs for small aerospace turbine engines decreased in fiscal  compared with fiscal this reflects an increase in demand for component repairs for newer model large aerospace turbine engines offset by reduced demand for component repairs for older model large aerospace turbine engines 
in addition  net sales associated with the demand for replacement parts  which often complement component repair services provided to customers  increased million in fiscal to million  compared with million in fiscal during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal included in the million of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were charges aggregating million related to the impairment of equipment and million of severance charges related to the further consolidation of the repair group s operations during fiscal the remaining selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales 
the repair group s operating loss in fiscal decreased million to million from a million loss in fiscal included in the million operating loss in fiscal were charges aggregating million related to the impairment of equipment and million of severance charges 
operating results improved in fiscal principally due to the non recurrence of the aforementioned impairment and severance charges 
the increased sales volumes for component manufacturing and repair service would have had a more positive impact on margins if not for the negative impact of the continued strength of the euro against the us dollar as described below 
during fiscal  the euro continued to strengthen in relation to the us dollar 
the repair group s non us operation has most of its sales denominated in us dollars while a significant portion of its operating costs are denominated in euros 
therefore  as the euro strengthens  costs denominated in euros are negatively impacted 
during fiscal  the repair group hedged much of its exposure to the strengthening euro thereby mitigating the negative impact on its operating results in that period 
during fiscal  the company did not hedge all of its exposure to the strengthening euro and  therefore  the resulting impact on the repair group s operating results in fiscal was higher operating costs of approximately million related to its non us operations  including selling  general and administrative expenses  when compared to fiscal aerospace component manufacturing group acm group net sales of the acm group in fiscal increased to million  compared with million in fiscal for purposes of the following discussion  the acm group considers aircraft that can accommodate less than passengers to be small aircraft and those that can accommodate or more passengers to be large aircraft 
net sales of airframe components for small aircraft decreased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of turbine engine components for small aircraft  which consist primarily of net sales to rolls royce corporation of turbine engine components for the ae series turbine engines for business and regional jets  as well as military transport and surveillance aircraft  increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of airframe components for large aircraft decreased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of turbine engine components for large aircraft increased to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of non aerospace components were million in both fiscal and other sales  consisting primarily of tooling revenue and order cancellation charges  were million in fiscal the acm group s airframe and turbine engine component products have both military and commercial applications 
net sales of airframe and turbine engine components that solely have military applications decreased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal included in the million of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was a credit of million for the reversal of a liability related to a previous year employment action that was settled in favor of the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal the remaining selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal benefited from a million reduction in the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable 
the acm group s operating income was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
operating results were favorably impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by i a million decrease in material cost primarily as a result of product mix consisting of a greater percentage of products sold containing lower cost materials  ii a million decrease in labor costs due to improved utilization of labor  iii a million decrease in manufacturing supplies and repair expenses  iv a million decrease in outside services expense  and v a million decrease in tooling expense 
operating results in fiscal were negatively impacted by a million increase in the lifo provision and a million increase in outside processing costs 
operating results in fiscal were favorably impacted by a million credit in selling  general and administrative expenses as discussed in the previous paragraph 
metal finishing group net sales of the metal finishing group increased to million in fiscal  compared with net sales of million in fiscal in fiscal  product net sales  consisting of selective electrochemical finishing equipment and solutions  increased to million  compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  customized selective electrochemical finishing contract service net sales increased to million  compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  net sales to customers in the oil and gas exploration industry increased million  net sales to customers in the aerospace industry increased million  and net sales to customers in the electronics industry increased million  compared with fiscal these net sales gains were partially offset in fiscal by a decrease of million in net sales to the us military  compared with fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal included in the million of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was a million non cash impairment charge to write off goodwill as a result of the company s annual goodwill impairment evaluation 
see note f  summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item for expanded discussion of goodwill impairment 
the remaining selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses were negatively impacted by a million increase in compensation and employee benefit expenses  consisting primarily of one time severance benefits  and a million increase in legal and professional expenses 
operating income in fiscal was negatively impacted by higher costs  including labor  employee benefits and depreciation associated with the start up of a new customer dedicated contract service operation at an existing service shop  higher insurance expense  as well as the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses previously discussed 
corporate unallocated expenses corporate unallocated expenses  consisting of corporate salaries and benefits  legal and professional and other corporate expenses were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal in the fiscal  corporate unallocated expenses were favorably impacted primarily by a million decrease in legal and professional expenses partially offset by a million increase in corporate salary and employee benefits expenses 
other general interest expense was million in both fiscal and the following table sets forth the weighted average interest rates and weighted average outstanding balances under the company s credit agreements in fiscal years and weighted average weighted average interest rate outstanding balance year ended september  year ended september  credit agreement industrial development variable rate demand revenue bond million million term note million million revolving credit agreement million million currency exchange loss was million in both fiscal and this loss is the result of the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations  resulting primarily from the impact of continued strength of the euro in relation to the us dollar  on the company s monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in us dollars 
in fiscal and  the income tax benefit related to the company s us and non us subsidiary losses was offset by a valuation allowance based upon an assessment of the company s ability to realize such benefits 
in assessing the company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets  management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
future reversal of the valuation allowance will be achieved either when the tax benefit is realized or when it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized through future taxable income 
the deferred tax asset of recognized in fiscal is attributable to the gain on the disposal of a building and land in october that was part of the repair group s irish operations and that was recognized for irish income tax purposes in fiscal fiscal year compared with fiscal year fiscal net sales of million were essentially comparable to fiscal net sales of million 
net loss for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with net loss of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal turbine component services and repair group repair group the repair group  which accounted for of the company s net sales in fiscal  had net sales of million  up from the million in fiscal turbine engine component manufacturing and repair net sales increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal  reflecting a million recovery in the fourth quarter of fiscal demand for component repairs for both small and large aerospace turbine engines increased in fiscal  compared with fiscal such increased demand reflects a strong recovery relative to large aerospace turbine engines in the fourth quarter of fiscal this reflects a reduction in component repairs for older model large aerospace turbine engines offset by increased demand for component repairs for newer model large aerospace turbine engines 
the reduced utilization of older generation aircraft that negatively impacted the company in fiscal continued during despite the increase in component repairs for newer model aerospace turbine engines  the commercial airline industry in general continues to experience reduced commercial flight hours  which determines the need for component repairs to newer model aerospace turbine engines 
lower demand for component repairs for industrial turbine engines partially offset the increase in demand for component repairs for both small and large aerospace turbine engines 
net sales associated with the demand for replacement parts  which often complement turbine engine component repair services provided to customers  were up million in to million  compared with million in fiscal the increase in replacement parts net sales is attributable to a change in product mix with certain major customers 
during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal included in the million of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were charges aggregating million related to equipment impairment and million of severance charges related to the further consolidation of the repair group s operations during fiscal included in the million of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million of charges related to goodwill and equipment impairment  a million increase in a contingency reserve related to a vendor dispute that was resolved during fiscal  and million of severance charges associated with the reduction of the repair group s capacity for the repairing of components related to older generation aerospace turbine engines 
the remaining selling  general and administrative expenses of million  or of net sales  in fiscal were million less than the remaining million  or of net sales  of such expenses in fiscal the repair group s operating loss in fiscal decreased million to million from an million loss in fiscal included in the operating loss in fiscal were charges aggregating million related to the impairment of equipment and million of severance charges 
included in the operating loss in fiscal were charges aggregating million related to inventory write downs million  the impairment of goodwill million  and the impairment of equipment million  and the million of severance charges 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the repair group performed an evaluation of its existing operations in light of the anticipated impacts on its business of the september  terrorist attacks 
the principal result of this evaluation process was the decision to optimize the repair group s multiple operations by reducing certain of its capacity for the repairing of components related to older generation aerospace turbine engines  principally the jtd 
as a result of this decision  the repair group recognized  during fiscal  the aforementioned charges 
in addition  during fiscal  the repair group increased  by million  a contingency reserve related to the previously discussed vendor dispute 
the repair group s million operating loss  before the million of aforementioned impairment and severance charges  during fiscal is a decrease of million  when compared to the million operating loss  before the million of aforementioned impairment  severance  and contingency charges  during fiscal the reduced operating loss  before the aforementioned charges in both years  was primarily due to the positive impact on margins of a increase in fiscal fourth quarter sales volumes for both component manufacturing and repair services and replacement parts 
partially offsetting the positive impact of the repair group s increased sales volumes in fiscal was the negative impact on margins of reduced pricing for its products 
such downward pressure on pricing is expected to continue  the magnitude of which is difficult to predict at this time 
during fiscal  the euro had strengthened against the us dollar when compared to fiscal the repair group s non us operations have a significant portion of its operating costs denominated in euros and  therefore  as the euro strengthens  such costs are negatively impacted 
during the first nine months of fiscal  the repair group was able to hedge much of its exposure to the strengthening euro thereby mitigating the negative impact on its operating results 
had the repair group not hedged such exposure during the first nine months of fiscal  its operating loss would have been greater by approximately million during fiscal the impact on the repair group s operating results in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the period during which it did not hedge much of its exposure to the strengthening euro  was higher operating costs of approximately million related to its non us operations  when compared to the same fiscal period 
in an effort to curtail the repair group s operating losses  which stem primarily from its current excess capacity for component repairs  the company ceased operations at its tampa  florida turbine engine component repair facility during fiscal and continues to optimize its remaining turbine engine component repair capacity through consolidation of operations and other productivity improvement efforts 
aerospace component manufacturing group acm group net sales in fiscal decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal for purposes of this discussion  the acm group considers aircraft that can accommodate less than passengers to be small aircraft  and those that can accommodate or more passengers to be large aircraft 
net sales of airframe components for large aircraft decreased million in fiscal to million  compared with million in fiscal net sales of airframe components for small aircraft were million in both fiscal and net sales of turbine engine components for small aircraft declined million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal million of the aforementioned net sales decrease is attributable to a decrease in net sales to rolls royce corporation consisting primarily of components for small turbine engines  such as the ae series latest generation turbine engines for business and regional jets  as well as military transport and surveillance aircraft 
net sales of non aerospace related products decreased million in fiscal to million  compared with million in fiscal certain of the acm group s products have both military and commercial aircraft applications 
net sales of airframe and turbine engine components for military applications increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million 
the primary factor impacting the acm group s selling  general and administrative expenses is a million reversal in fiscal of a charge that was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal such charge was recorded in connection with an employment action and a related claim that was settled in favor of the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company had filed a claim against its insurance carrier for its failure to provide coverage 
selling  general and administrative expenses  before the impact of this legal contingency reserve  were million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal benefited by a reduction of million in the acm group s bad debt expense  compared with fiscal the acm group s operating income was million in fiscal  compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal operating results in fiscal were favorably impacted by the reversal of the million legal contingency accrual  while operating results in fiscal were unfavorably impacted by the establishment of such legal contingency accrual as discussed above 
operating income  before the impact of this legal contingency reserve  was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal operating results were favorably impacted in fiscal by a million decrease in variable tooling expenses and by a million decrease in outside services expense 
such decreases were primarily attributable to the acm group s efforts to reduce such expenditures and to perform the work in house 
as noted previously  selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal benefited by a reduction of million in the acm group s bad debt expense  compared with fiscal these expense decreases were offset in part by a million increase in energy expenses 
the balance of the change in operating income is primarily attributable to the interplay between overall lower net sales in relation to fixed manufacturing  selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal during fiscal  the acm group continued the cost containment and reduction actions initiated in fiscal to mitigate  in part  the impact of reduced revenues 
metal finishing group net sales in fiscal decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  product net sales  consisting of selective electrochemical metal finishing equipment and solutions  decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  contract service net sales decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal net sales to customers in the power generation  general manufacturing  and aerospace industries decreased approximately million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal due to overall weakness in these industries  compared with fiscal these net sales decreases were partially offset by an increase in net sales to customers in the automotive industry of approximately million in fiscal  compared with fiscal  attributable primarily to increased net sales from existing customers in this industry 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in both fiscal and  or and of net sales  respectively 
in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were negatively impacted by a million increase in compensation expense and a million increase in legal and professional expense  compared with fiscal these increases were offset by a million decrease in employee incentive expense 
the metal finishing group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal operating results were negatively impacted by a million increase in legal and professional expense 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in total employee incentive expense in fiscal  compared with fiscal the balance of the decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to the interplay between overall lower net sales in relation to fixed manufacturing  selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal  compared with fiscal corporate unallocated expenses corporate unallocated expenses  consisting of corporate salaries and benefits  legal and professional and other corporate expenses  were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  corporate unallocated expenses were favorably impacted by lower corporate pension expense of million due to the decision in fiscal to cease the accrual of future benefits under a defined benefit pension plan 
lower legal and professional and consulting expenses also favorably impacted corporate unallocated expenses in fiscal  compared with fiscal other general interest income was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the reduction of interest income is attributable to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances outstanding and to lower interest rates available from short term investments during fiscal  compared with fiscal interest expense was million in both fiscal and term note interest expense decreased slightly in fiscal  compared with fiscal the decrease in the weighted average term note outstanding balance of million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal  was partially offset by an increase in the weighted average interest rate payable under the term note in fiscal revolving credit agreement interest expense was comparable in both fiscal and the decrease in the interest rate payable under the revolving credit agreement was offset by an increase in the weighted average revolving credit agreement outstanding balance of million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the interest rate payable under the industrial development variable rate demand revenue bond decreased in fiscal  compared with fiscal the weighted average industrial development variable rate demand revenue bond outstanding balance during fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal foreign currency exchange loss was million in fiscal  compared with nil in the comparable period in fiscal this loss is the result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  resulting primarily from the decline in the value of the us dollar in relation to the euro  on the company s monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in us dollars 
in fiscal  the income tax benefit related to the company s us and non us subsidiary losses was offset by a valuation allowance based upon an assessment of the company s ability to realize such benefits 
in assessing the company s ability to realize its net deferred tax assets  management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
future reversal of the valuation allowance will be achieved either when the tax benefit is realized or when it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized through future taxable income 
the modest tax benefit recognized in fiscal is attributable to the realization of a residual portion of fiscal s tax loss carryback in fiscal by one of the company s non us subsidiaries 
b 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased to million at september  from million at september  at present  essentially all of the company s cash and cash equivalents are in the possession of its non us subsidiaries and relate to undistributed earnings 
distributions from the company s non us subsidiaries to the company may be subject to statutory restrictions  adverse tax consequences or other limitations 
in october  the american jobs creation act of act was enacted 
the act contains a one time provision allowing earnings of controlled foreign companies to be repatriated  at a reduced tax rate  during the tax year that includes october or during the subsequent tax year 
the company expects to receive a dividend from its non us subsidiaries during the first half of fiscal the company is still evaluating the act s effects on its repatriation plans and expects to complete its evaluation during the first half of fiscal the range of potential amounts to be repatriated is million to million  which would result in a potential income tax obligation of million to million 
the company s operating activities provided cash of million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal is primarily due to a million decrease in inventories and a million increase in accounts payable  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable 
the change in these components of working capital was due to factors resulting from normal business conditions of the company  including sales levels  the relative timing of payments to suppliers  and inventory levels required to support customer demand 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures consist of million by the acm group  million by the metal finishing group and million by the repair group 
capital expenditures in fiscal consisted primarily of equipment to expand and diversify both the acm group s manufacturing and machining capabilities and the repair group s repair capabilities 
the company anticipates that total fiscal capital expenditures will approximate million 
fiscal capital expenditures are anticipated to i provide increased range of manufacturing capabilities  ii automate certain machining operations  and iii enhance the company s service and repair capabilities 
at september   the company has a year industrial development variable rate demand revenue bond outstanding  which was issued to expand the repair group s tampa  florida facility 
the industrial development bond requires annual principal payments ranging from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the interest rate at september  was 
the outstanding balance of the industrial development bond at september  was million 
the bank s annual commitment fee on the standby letter of credit that collateralizes the industrial development bond is of the outstanding balance 
operations at the tampa  florida facility ceased in fiscal at september   the facility is held for sale 
in november  the company completed the sale of this facility 
the net proceeds from the sale were approximately million and the assets that were sold had a net book value of approximately million 
the proceeds from the sale of the facility will likely be utilized to retire the industrial development bond 
at september   the company has a term note that is repayable in quarterly installments of million through august  with the remaining balance of million due september  the term note has a variable interest rate  which  after giving effect to an interest rate swap agreement  becomes an effective fixed rate term note  subject to adjustment based upon the level of certain financial ratios 
the effective fixed interest rate at september  was 
the outstanding balance of the term note at september  was million 
at september   the company has a million revolving credit agreement  subject to sufficiency of collateral  that expires on september  and bears interest at the bank s base rate plus 
the interest rate was at september  a commitment fee is incurred on the unused balance of the revolving credit agreement 
at september   the outstanding balance was million and the company had million available under its million revolving credit agreement 
all of the company s long term debt is secured by substantially all of the company s assets located in the us  a guarantee by its us subsidiaries and a pledge of of the company s ownership interest in its non us subsidiaries 
under its credit agreements  the company is subject to certain customary covenants 
these include  without limitations  covenants as defined that require maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  including a minimum tangible net worth level  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
during fiscal  the company entered into agreements with its bank to waive its minimum tangible net worth covenant at march  and to modify such covenant for future periods 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with its bank to amend certain provisions of its credit agreements 
the amendment extends the maturity date of the company s term note and million revolving credit agreement to april   waives its minimum tangible net worth and fixed charge coverage ratios at september  and modifies its minimum tangible net worth requirement for future periods 
taking into consideration the impact of this amendment  the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at september  in october  the company completed the sale of a building and land that was part of its repair group s irish operations and was included in assets held for sale at september  the net proceeds from the sale of these assets were million and the assets that were sold had a net book value of approximately million 
the company believes that cash flows from its operations and proceeds from the aforementioned property sales together with existing cash reserves and the funds available under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements through the end of fiscal year however  no assurances can be given as to the sufficiency of the company s working capital to support the company s operations 
if the existing cash reserves  cash flow from operations and funds available under the revolving credit agreement are insufficient  if working capital requirements are greater than currently estimated  and or if the company is unable to satisfy the covenants set forth in its credit agreements  the company may be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures  restructuring indebtedness  selling assets or operations  or issuing additional shares of capital stock in the company 
there can be no assurance that any of these actions could be accomplished  or if so  on terms favorable to the company  or that they would enable the company to continue to satisfy its working capital requirements 
c 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement and that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
for discussion of i an interest rate swap agreement  see interest rate risk  and ii foreign currency exchange contracts  see foreign currency risk included in item a 
d 
other contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s outstanding contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at september   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
amounts in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt     capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total     reflects november amendment to company s credit agreement with its bank 
excluded from the foregoing other contractual obligations table are open purchase orders at september  for raw materials and supplies required in the normal course of business 
e 
outlook the company s repair and acm groups businesses continue to be heavily dependent upon the strength of the commercial airlines as well as aircraft and related engine manufacturers 
consequently  the performance of the domestic and international air transport industry directly and significantly impacts the performance of the repair and acm groups businesses 
the events of september  resulted in an immediate reduction in the demand for passenger travel both in the us and internationally 
aircraft manufacturers announced reductions in forecasted aircraft deliveries as a result of such reduced demand 
in addition  the financial condition of many airlines in the us and throughout the world continues to be weak 
the us airline industry has received us government assistance  while some airlines have entered bankruptcy proceedings  and others continue to pursue major restructuring initiatives 
in more recent years  declines in the commercial airline  aircraft and related engine industries have been partially offset by increases in us military spending for aircraft and related components 
demand for passenger travel recently rebounded to pre september  levels 
the air transport industry s long term outlook has been one of continued  steady growth 
such outlook suggests the need for additional aircraft and  therefore  growth in the requirement for airframe and engine components as well as aerospace turbine engine repairs 
it is difficult to determine the potential long term impact that the global terrorism threat may have on air travel and the demand for the products and services provided by the company 
these factors could result in further decreases in orders for new and after market commercial aerospace products and repair services as well as an increase in credit risk associated with doing business with the financially troubled airlines and their suppliers 
all of these consequences  to the extent that they may occur  could negatively impact the company s net sales  operating profits and cash flows 
however  in light of the current business environment  the company believes that that cash on hand  funds available under its revolving credit agreement  anticipated funds generated from operations and funds generated from recent property sales will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs through the foreseeable future 
f 
critical accounting policies and estimates allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowances for doubtful accounts each quarter based on the customers credit worthiness  current economic trends or market conditions  past collection history  aging of outstanding accounts receivable and specific identified risks 
inventories the company maintains allowances for obsolete and excess inventory 
the company evaluates its allowances for obsolete and excess inventory each quarter 
each business segment maintains formal policies  which require at a minimum that reserves be established based on an analysis of the age of the inventory on a part by part basis 
in addition  if the company learns of specific obsolescence  other than that identified by the aging criteria  an additional reserve will be recognized as well 
specific obsolescence may arise due to a technological or market change  or based on cancellation of an order 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review is performed using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  which include proceeds from disposal of assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the long lived asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the company has a significant amount of property  plant and equipment 
the determination as to whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable involves judgment 
the company believes that its estimate of future undiscounted cash flows is a critical accounting estimate because i it requires the company to make assumptions about future results and ii the impact of recognizing an impairment charge could have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in projecting future undiscounted cash flows  the company relies on internal budgets and forecasts  and projected proceeds upon disposal of long lived assets 
the company s budgets and forecasts are based on historical results and anticipated future market conditions  such as the general business climate and the effectiveness of competition 
the company believes that its estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such undiscounted cash flows and fair value could change the company s estimates of fair value 
further  actual results can differ significantly from assumptions used by the company in making its estimates 
future changes in the company s estimates could result in future impairment charges 
goodwill the company complies with the accounting standards that require goodwill to be tested for impairment at least annually using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the segment 
if the fair value of the segment exceeds its book value  goodwill of the segment is not considered impaired 
to estimate the fair value of the metal finishing group  the company computed the segment s projected debt free cash flows related to future periods 
applying present value techniques to the debt free cash flow information  the company estimated the fair value of the segment 
as a result  the company determined that the fair value of the metal finishing group did not exceed its book value  including goodwill  at september  as a consequence  the company concluded that the metal finishing group s goodwill was fully impaired at september  and  therefore  a full write off as of such date was appropriate 
the company believes that its estimate of the metal finishing group s projected debt free cash flows is a critical accounting estimate because i it requires the company to make assumptions about future results and ii the impact of recognizing an impairment of goodwill could have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in projecting debt free cash flow  the company relied on internal budgets and forecasts 
the company s budgets and forecasts are based on historical results and anticipated future market conditions  such as the general business climate and the effectiveness of competition 
valuation of deferred tax allowance the company accounts for deferred taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  whereby the company recognizes an income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis 
at september   the company s net deferred tax asset before any valuation allowance was million 
at september   the income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis was offset by a valuation allowance of million based on an assessment of the company s ability to realize such benefits 
in assessing the company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets  management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
future reversal of the valuation allowance will be achieved either when the tax benefit is realized or when it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized through future taxable income

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to foreign currency and interest rate risk 
the risks primarily relate to the sale of the company s products in transactions denominated in non us dollar currencies primarily the euro  the payment in local currency  of wages and other costs related to the company s non us operations  and changes in interest rates on the company s long term debt obligations 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company believes that inflation has not materially affected its results of operations in  and does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in fiscal a 
foreign currency risk the us dollar is the functional currency for all of the company s us operations as well as its irish subsidiary 
the functional currency of the irish subsidiary is the us dollar because a substantial majority of the subsidiary s transactions are denominated in us dollars 
for these operations  all gains and losses from completed currency transactions are included in income currently 
for the company s other non us subsidiaries  the functional currency is the local currency 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange at the end of the period and revenues and expenses are translated using average rates of exchange 
foreign currency translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity 
historically  the company has been able to mitigate the impact of foreign currency risk by means of hedging such risk through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts  which typically expire within one year 
however  such risk is mitigated only for the periods for which the company has foreign currency exchange contracts in effect  and only to the extent of the us dollar amounts of such contracts 
at september   the company had forward exchange contracts outstanding for durations of up to months to purchase euros aggregating us million at a euro to us dollar exchange rate of approximately 
a ten percent appreciation or depreciation of the value of the us dollar relative to the currency in which the forward exchange contracts outstanding at september  are denominated  would result in a million decline or increase  respectively  in the value of the forward exchange contracts 
the company will continue to evaluate its foreign currency risk  if any  and the effectiveness of using similar hedges in the future to mitigate such risk 
at september   the company s assets and liabilities denominated in british pounds and the euro were as follows amounts in thousands british pounds euro cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable  accrued liabilities b 
interest rate risk the company s primary interest rate risk exposure results from the variable interest rate mechanisms associated with the company s long term debt consisting of a term note  a revolving credit agreement and industrial development variable rate demand revenue bond 
these interest rate exposures are managed in part by an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate of the term note 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease basis points from the september  rates  and assuming no changes in the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement and industrial development bond  annual interest expense to the company would increase or decrease million  respectively 
the company s sensitivity analyses of the effects of changes in interest rates do not consider the impact of a potential change in the level of variable rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical conditions prevail
