item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that judgments and estimates related to the following critical accounting policies could materially affect its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable the company performs on going credit evaluations of its customers and assesses the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a number of factors including the customer s financial condition and collection history  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory the company estimates the carrying value of its inventory based upon historic usage and management s assumptions relating to projected customer purchases  product design changes and product obsolescence 
the changing technology markets that we supply also affect these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes the company has recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement reporting purposes 
the company must estimate its income tax valuation allowance by assessing which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be recovered in the future 
based on our assessment of the realization of these assets  the company has recorded a valuation allowance of  at december  in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  realizability of refundable income taxes  the deductibility of the disposal of scrap and worthless inventory  taxable income in prior carryback years and taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
financial condition and liquidity cash and cash equivalents amounted to  at december   a decrease of  from the december  level 
during  the company s continuing operations provided cash of  investing activities used cash of  and financing activities used cash of  cash provided from operations of  resulted mainly from the net loss of  adjusted for the non cash effect of depreciation and deferred income taxes of  and an  reduction in working capital  excluding the effects of the acquisition of mf electronics corp 
mf 
this net reduction in working capital  excluding the effects of the acquisition of mf  was mainly due to a  decrease in inventory  a  increase in accounts payable and an  decrease in refundable income taxes 
the reduction in inventory was mainly due to orders being filled from existing inventory and a continuing control of inventory levels 
the increase in accounts payable is mainly due to the increased business level 
during  the company acquired certain assets and assumed certain trade payables of mf for  in cash 
capital expenditures amounted to  in the company s budget for capital expenditures is approximately the company used  of cash in to pay off the remaining balance on its term note with a bank 
during  the company used  of cash to purchase and retire  shares of its common stock 
while the company is projecting a loss in based on the current conditions in the telecom market  management believes that based on its current working capital and the expected cash flows from operations  the company s resources are sufficient to meet its financial needs and to fund the capital expenditures for the projected levels of business in results of operations versus net sales from continuing operations increased  or over the sales increase is mainly due to the sales from the mf product line acquired at the end of may the net sales amount includes sales cancellation charges of approximately  from two customers 
excluding the effect on net sales from these sales cancellation charges and the sales generated from the mf product line  sales increased over the book to bill ratio for was versus 
in the company s backlog amounted to million at december  compared to million at december  capital spending in the telecom market  the largest market for our products  continued to decline until the fourth quarter of when we saw a slight increase in order activity 
during  the company saw increased order activity in the it markets servers  switches and storage and military avionics 
at this time  we are not sure of the potential impact on the company s future operations from the current continuing telecom market uncertainties and our industry s over capacity issues 
the company reported an  gross profit in compared to a  gross loss in the main reasons for the improvement in the gross profit were a reduction in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory of  a  decrease in overhead expenses mainly due to reductions in personnel expense and operating supplies compared to and the  of gross profit generated by the mf sales in raw material costs  as a percentage of sales  decreased about from mainly as a result of product mix changes and direct labor remained fairly consistent as a percentage of sales with selling and advertising expenses decreased  from reductions in advertising and promotional expenses  and bad debt expense  partially offset by higher sales commission expense of  to the company s outside manufacturers representatives were the main reasons for the expense decrease 
general and administrative expenses increased  over increased personnel expenses mainly due to the hiring of a new president in the fourth quarter of and approximately  of personnel expenses associated with the acquisition of the mf product line  were the primary reasons for this higher expense 
the decrease in interest income of  from was mainly due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates during the current year 
the  decrease in interest expense from the amount is mainly due to the company paying off the balance of its outstanding term debt in the first quarter of during  the company received  in cash as the final proceeds from the sales of a former subsidiary in and the related real estate in and recorded a total pre tax gain of  on these sales 
the combined federal and state effective income tax rate for is compared to in the difference in the rates is mainly due to the recording of an income tax valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets in during both years  a valuation allowance has been recorded for the full amount of the state income tax benefit due to the uncertainty of realization

the company has experienced a drop off in market demand for its products beginning in the first quarter of and continuing to date as customers have reported slower growth rates and excess inventory levels 
in addition  some customers requested order cancellations 
as a result of the continued decline in market demand  the company began with a backlog of million versus a backlog of million at the beginning of we believe that market conditions for our products  in particular the telecom market  have not bottomed out  and near term visibility continues to be poor 
the telecom industry continues to operate at low levels of production with customers not willing to commit to forecasts and long term contracts 
orders for the most part continue to be small with near term delivery dates 
the company s backlog at december  was million

it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
fin is effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   regardless of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the company adopted this fin effective january  the adoption of this statement had no material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities

under the interpretation  certain entities known as variable interest entities vie must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of an entity 
the primary beneficiary is generally defined as having the majority of the risks and rewards arising from the vie 
for vie s in which a significant but not majority variable interest is held  certain disclosures are required 
in december  the fasb completed deliberations of proposed modifications to fin revised interpretations resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date of the vie 
vies created after january   but prior to january  may be accounted for either based on the original interpretation or the revised interpretations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s cash balances in excess of operating requirements are currently invested in money market accounts 
these money market accounts are subject to interest rate risk and interest income will fluctuate in relation to general money market rates 
based on the cash and cash equivalent balance at december   and assuming the balance was totally invested in money market instruments for the full year  a hypothetical point decline in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in interest income 
the company purchases certain inventory from and sells product in foreign countries 
as these activities are currently transacted in us dollars  they are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
however  significant fluctuation in the currencies where the company purchases inventory or sells product could make the us dollar equivalent of such transactions more or less favorable to the company and the other involved parties
