the company s operating results primarily include operating income from the company s investment portfolio  gains from dispositions and fee income from developments 
a cornerstone of this strategy is the consistent redeployment of its capital

centerpoint s development pipeline the company s financial results include the company s property development and redevelopment activities 
these projects require the incurrence of substantial capital costs and related expenses in advance of rental income 
as of december   the company and its subsidiaries had million of development costs invested in projects  including  acres of owned land for future development at the company s current industrial parks centerpoint intermodal center  kenney property at rochelle  illinois next to the union pacific intermodal yard  and mccook metals at mccook  illinois  seven buildings totaling million square feet and other projects in early stages of development

critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following section is a summary of certain aspects of those accounting policies that require management estimates and judgment 
when real estate properties are acquired  acquisition costs are allocated to components of the property  any in place leases  and any potential tenant relationships using relative fair values based on historical experience and the company s current judgment 
these assumptions and estimates impact the amount of costs allocated between land  different categories of building and land improvements and certain deferred expense related the acquired property 
the allocation assumptions ultimately affect the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions  depreciation and amortization expense  and gains or losses recorded on sales of properties 
for industrial park and multi phased developments  costs are assigned to individual components of the project when those costs benefit certain sites rather than the whole project 
where specific identification is impractical or costs incurred benefit the project as a whole  capitalized costs are allocated as follows site acquisition costs and all other common costs are allocated to each land parcel benefited based on the relative fair market value of each land parcel before construction 
site improvement and construction costs are allocated to individual parcels based on relative sales value of each unit upon completion 
when allocation based on relative sales value is impractical  capitalized costs are allocated based on acreage 
in the event a parcel within a park development is sold prior to completion of the park  the sales basis of the sold parcel will reflect a pro rata allocation of future common costs 
receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and may be uncollectible in the future 
the company reviews its receivables regularly for potential collection problems in computing the allowance recorded against its receivables 
the company adds all specifically identified doubtful accounts as specific additions to the reserve and adds a percentage of other long outstanding items based on historical trends 
this review process requires the company to make certain judgments regarding collections that are inherently difficult to predict 
tif is a municipal financing and planning technique that is widely used to renovate declining areas or redevelop blighted areas while expanding a municipality s tax base 
tifs allow municipalities to make needed public and private improvements by promising to return all or a portion of the real estate tax increase generated by the improvements to the developer for a limited period of time 
this contract to pay the tax increment to the developer is usually documented in a redevelopment agreement between the city and the developer and usually results in the creation of developer notes payable from the city to the developer 
the company accounts for developer notes as either reimbursement of improvement costs incurred or as real estate tax abatement depending on the facts and circumstances of the each redevelopment agreement 
effective january   the company changed its accounting policy related to certain developer notes 
the company has described its accounting for each of its developer note arrangements and has described the financial impact of the change in accounting principle in note and note  respectively  of the consolidated financial statements

 reporting of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of the business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
fas no 
retained the basic provisions of fas no 
with respect to asset impairments  but provides more specific guidance related to measuring impairment 
the company will continue to recognize an impairment loss on real estate assets under the following circumstances when management has designated the asset to be held for sale and the fair value of the asset less the cost of disposal is less than the asset s carrying value  or when market conditions  a contract for sale or some other triggering event has made it certain that the carrying amount of an asset held for use might not be recoverable and the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset 
in cases of impairment  the asset will be reduced to its fair value based on the property s estimated discounted future cash flows 
the amount of the reduction is recorded as an operating expense  impairment of asset

the company may incur costs for building related capital improvements necessary to maintain the useful life and enhance the utility of its properties 
tenant financial difficulties including their ability to pay rent 
long term greater than one year capital needs for property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major redevelopment projects  expansions  and construction of build to suit properties will be supported  initially by disposition proceeds  supplemented by draws on the company s unsecured line of credit  followed by the issuance of long term unsecured indebtedness and if necessary equity issuance

the company s ability to refinance its existing indebtedness with favorable terms

most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  many of the leases are for remaining terms less than five years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rental rates if rents of existing leases are below the then existing market rate
