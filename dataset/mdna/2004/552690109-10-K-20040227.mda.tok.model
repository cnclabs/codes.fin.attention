regulation and competition montana dakota is subject to competition in varying degrees  in certain areas  from rural electric cooperatives  on site generators  co generators and municipally owned systems 
in addition  competition in varying degrees exists between electricity and alternative forms of energy such as natural gas 
the restructuring of the electric industry has been slowed due to certain events in the industry 
in addition  as a result of competition in electric generation  wholesale power markets have become increasingly competitive and evaluations are ongoing concerning retail competition 
montana dakota is a member of the midwest independent transmission system operator  inc midwest iso 
the midwest iso is responsible for operational control of the transmission systems of its members 
the midwest iso agreement permits montana dakota to be a separate pricing zone 
the midwest iso also provides security center operations and tariff administration 
the montana legislature passed an electric industry restructuring bill  effective may  the bill provided for full customer choice of electric supplier by july   stranded cost recovery and other provisions 
based on the provisions of such restructuring bill  because montana dakota operates in more than one state  the company had the option of deferring its transition to full customer choice until in march  legislation was passed in montana which delays the restructuring and transition to full customer choice until a time when montana dakota can reasonably implement customer choice in the state of its primary service territory 
in its legislative session  the north dakota legislature established an electric industry competition committee to study over a six year period the impact of competition on the generation  transmission and distribution of electric energy in north dakota 
in  the committee was expanded and the study was extended for an additional four years 
to date  the committee has made no recommendation regarding restructuring 
in  the wypsc selected a consultant to perform a study on the impact of electric restructuring in wyoming 
the study found no material economic benefits 
no further action is pending at this time 
the sdpuc has not initiated any proceedings to date concerning retail competition or electric industry restructuring 
federal legislation addressing this issue continues to be discussed 
although montana dakota is unable to predict the outcome of such regulatory proceedings or legislation  or the extent to which retail competition may occur  montana dakota is continuing to take steps to effectively operate in an increasingly competitive environment

degree days are a measure of daily temperature related demand for energy for heating 
competition in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other fuels and forms of energy 
montana dakota and great plains have established various natural gas transportation service rates for their distribution businesses to retain interruptible commercial and industrial load 
certain of these services include transportation under flexible rate schedules whereby montana dakota s and great plains interruptible customers can avail themselves of the advantages of open access transportation on regional transmission pipelines  including the system of williston basin  northern natural gas company and viking gas transmission company 
these services have enhanced montana dakota s and great plains competitive posture with alternate fuels  although certain of montana dakota s customers have bypassed the respective distribution systems by directly accessing transmission pipelines located within close proximity 
these bypasses did not have a material effect on results of operations 
montana dakota and great plains acquire their system requirements directly from producers  processors and marketers 
such natural gas is supplied by a portfolio of contracts specifying market based pricing  and is transported under transportation agreements by williston basin  kinder morgan  inc  south dakota intrastate pipeline company  northern border pipeline company  viking gas transmission company and northern natural gas company to provide firm service to their customers 
montana dakota has also contracted with williston basin to provide firm storage services that enable montana dakota to meet winter peak requirements as well as allow it to better manage its natural gas costs by purchasing natural gas at more uniform daily volumes throughout the year 
demand for natural gas  which is a widely traded commodity  is sensitive to seasonal heating and industrial load requirements as well as changes in market price 
montana dakota and great plains believe that  based on regional supplies of natural gas and the pipeline transmission network currently available through its suppliers and pipeline service providers  supplies are adequate to meet its system natural gas requirements for the next five years

great plains requested a total of million annually or percent above current rates 
in december  the mpuc issued an order setting interim rates that approved an interim increase of million annually effective december  great plains began collecting such rates effective december   subject to refund until the mpuc issues a final order 
on october   the mpuc issued a final order authorizing an increase of million annually and requiring great plains to file a compliance filing with the mpuc 
on january   the mpuc issued an order accepting great plains compliance filing  which was filed on november   effective with service rendered on and after january  reserves have been provided for a portion of the revenues that have been collected subject to refund for certain of the above proceedings 
the company believes that such reserves are adequate based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the proceedings 
montana dakota s and great plains retail natural gas rate schedules contain clauses permitting monthly adjustments in rates based upon changes in natural gas commodity  transportation and storage costs 
current regulatory practices allow montana dakota and great plains to recover increases or refund decreases in such costs within a period ranging from months to months from the time such costs are paid

these services are provided to utilities and large manufacturing  commercial  government and institutional customers 
construction and maintenance crews are active year round 
however  activity in certain locations may be seasonal in nature due to the effects of weather 
utility services operates a fleet of owned and leased trucks and trailers  support vehicles and specialty construction equipment  such as backhoes  excavators  trenchers  generators  boring machines and cranes 
in addition  as of december   utility services owned or leased offices in states 
this space is used for offices  equipment yards  warehousing  storage and vehicle shops 
at december   utility services net plant investment was approximately million 
the utility services segment backlog is comprised of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that it expects to provide under other master agreements 
the backlog at january   was approximately million compared to approximately million at january  the company expects to complete a significant amount of the backlog during the year ending december  due to the nature of its contractual arrangements  in many instances the company s customers are not committed to the specific volumes of services to be purchased under a contract  but rather the company is committed to perform these services if and to the extent requested by the customer 
the customer is  however  obligated to obtain these services from the company if they are not performed by the customer s employees 
therefore  there can be no assurance as to the customer s requirements during a particular period or that such estimates at any point in time are predictive of future revenues 
this industry is experiencing a shortage of linemen in certain areas 
utility services works with the national electrical contractors association and the ibew on hiring and recruiting of qualified linemen 
competition utility services operates in a highly competitive business environment 
most of utility services work is obtained on the basis of competitive bids or by negotiation of either cost plus or fixed price contracts 
the workforce and equipment are highly mobile  providing greater flexibility in the size and location of utility services market area 
competition is based primarily on price and reputation for quality  safety and reliability

utility services believes that the diversification of the services it provides  the market it serves throughout the united states and the management of its workforce will enable it to effectively operate in this competitive environment 
utilities and independent contractors represent the largest customer base for this segment 
accordingly  utility and sub contract work accounts for a significant portion of the work performed by the utility services segment and the amount of construction contracts is dependent to a certain extent on the level and timing of maintenance and construction programs undertaken by customers 
utility services relies on repeat customers and strives to maintain successful long term relationships with these customers 
environmental matters utility services operations are subject to regulation customary for the industry  including federal  state and local environmental compliance 
utility services believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations 
the nature of utility services operations is such that few  if any  environmental permits are required 
operational convenience supports the use of petroleum storage tanks in several locations  which are permitted under state programs authorized by the epa 
utility services currently has no ongoing remediation related to releases from petroleum storage tanks 
utility services operations are conditionally exempt small quantity waste generators  subject to minimal regulation under the rcra 
federal permits for specific construction and maintenance jobs that may require these permits are typically obtained by the hiring entity  and not by utility services

under the natural gas act  as amended  williston basin is subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc regarding certificate  rate  service and accounting matters 
system demand and competition williston basin competes with several pipelines for its customers transportation business and at times may discount rates in an effort to retain market share 
however  the strategic location of williston basin s system near five natural gas producing basins and the availability of underground storage and gathering services provided by williston basin and affiliates along with interconnections with other pipelines serve to enhance williston basin s competitive position 
although a significant portion of williston basin s firm customers  which include montana dakota  have relatively secure residential and commercial end users  virtually all have some price sensitive end users that could switch to alternate fuels 
williston basin transports substantially all of montana dakota s natural gas utilizing firm transportation agreements  which at december   represented percent of williston basin s currently subscribed firm transportation capacity 
in october  montana dakota executed a firm transportation agreement with williston basin for a term of five years expiring in june in addition  in july  montana dakota entered into a year contract with williston basin to provide firm storage services to facilitate meeting montana dakota s winter peak requirements 
system supply williston basin s underground storage facilities have a certificated storage capacity of approximately billion cubic feet bcf  including bcf of working gas capacity  bcf of cushion gas and bcf of native gas 
the native gas includes bcf of recoverable gas 
williston basin s storage facilities enable its customers to purchase natural gas at more uniform daily volumes throughout the year and  thus  facilitate meeting winter peak requirements 
natural gas supplies from traditional regional sources have declined during the past several years and such declines are anticipated to continue 
as a result  williston basin anticipates that a potentially significant amount of the future supply needed to meet its customers demands will come from non traditional  off system sources 
the company s coalbed natural gas assets in the powder river basin are expected to meet some of these supply needs 
for additional information regarding coalbed natural gas legal proceedings  see item legal proceedings and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors and cautionary statements that may affect future results environmental and regulatory risks 
williston basin expects to facilitate the movement of these supplies by making available its transportation and storage services
