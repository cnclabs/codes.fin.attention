mrs 
est e lauder formulated this marketing philosophy to provide high quality service and products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base 
our marketing efforts focus principally on promoting the quality and benefits of our products 
each of our brands is distinctively positioned  has a single global image  and is promoted with consistent logos  packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands 
we regularly advertise our products on television and radio  in upscale magazines and prestigious newspapers and through direct mail and photo displays at international airports 
in addition  our products receive extensive editorial coverage in prestige publications and other media worldwide 
promotional activities and in store displays are designed to introduce existing consumers to different products in the line and to attract new consumers 
our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with retailers  some of which are supported by coordinated promotions  such as purchase with purchase and gift with purchase 
at in store counters  sales representatives offer personal demonstrations to market individual products as well as to provide education on basic skin care and makeup application 
we conduct extensive sampling programs and we pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling program 
we believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers 
starting with the launch of the clinique website in  we have used the internet to educate and inform consumers about certain of our brands 
currently  we have sixteen single brand marketing sites  eight of which have e commerce capabilities  and gloss 
com  our majority owned  multi brand marketing and e commerce site 
most of our creative marketing work is done by in house creative teams 
the creative staff designs and produces the sales materials  advertisements and packaging for all products in each brand 
total advertising and promotional expenditures were  million   million and  million for fiscal  and  respectively 
these amounts include expenses relating to purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of sales 
our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers and key retailers and consulting with sales representatives at the points of sale 
these include est e lauder beauty advisors  clinique consultants  aramis selling specialists  prescriptives analysts  origins guides and m a c makeup artists 
management information systems management information systems support business processes including product development  marketing  sales  order processing  production  distribution and finance 
of the many systems currently being utilized  the most significant to our business needs are i a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer  or plan to offer  which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality  ii a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit sku level at most significant retail sales locations ie  sell through data  increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development  manufacturing and marketing strategies  iii an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers  allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically  with minimal paperwork  and iv an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to actual requirements  resulting in improved inventory control and distribution for both existing product lines and new product launches 
the efficiencies provided by these systems have resulted in increased sales  fewer out of stocks and reduced retail inventories 
we expect that these systems will continue to provide inventory and sales efficiencies in the short and medium terms 
as part of our ongoing effort to enhance these efficiencies  we are evaluating enterprise wide global programs that could deliver a single set of integrated data  processes and technologies  which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands  operating units and sales affiliates 
research and development we believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products 
marketing  product development and packaging groups work with our research and development group to identify shifts in consumer preferences  develop new products and redesign or reformulate existing products 
in addition  research and development personnel work closely with quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products with attributes that fulfill consumer expectations 
we maintain ongoing research and development programs at our facilities in melville  new york  oevel  belgium  tokyo  japan  markham  ontario  blaine  minnesota  and colombes  france 
as of june   we had approximately employees engaged in research and development 
research and development expenditures totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our research and development group makes significant contributions toward improving existing products and developing new products and provides ongoing technical assistance and know how to our manufacturing activities 
the research and development group has had long standing working relationships with several us and international medical and educational facilities  which supplement internal capabilities 
we do not conduct animal testing of our products 
manufacturing and raw materials we manufacture skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products in the united states  belgium  switzerland  the united kingdom  canada and france 
we continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation  increase efficiencies and reduce costs 
our major manufacturing facilities operate as focus plants that primarily manufacture one type of product eg  lipsticks for all of the principal brands 
our plants are modern and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated 
while we believe that our manufacturing facilities are sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements  we continue to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity and productivity 
to capitalize on innovation and other supply benefits  we continue to utilize third parties on a global basis for finished goods production 
the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils  alcohol and specialty chemicals 
we also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications 
procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our centralized supplier relations department 
a concentrated effort in supplier rationalization has been made with the specific objective of reducing costs  increasing innovation and improving quality 
as a result of sourcing initiatives  there is increased dependency on certain suppliers  but we believe that these suppliers have adequate resources and facilities to overcome any unforeseen interruption of supply 
we are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will add or delete suppliers based upon the changing needs of the business 
we have  in the past  been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products 
as we integrate acquired brands  we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve manufacturing performance 
competition the skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care businesses are characterized by vigorous competition throughout the world 
brand recognition  quality  performance and price have a significant influence on consumers choices among competing products and brands 
advertising  promotion  merchandising  the pace and timing of new product introductions  line extensions and the quality of in store sales staff also have a significant impact on consumers buying decisions 
we compete against a number of manufacturers and marketers of skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products  some of which have substantially greater resources than we do 
our principal competitors among manufacturers and marketers of skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products include l oreal sa  which markets lanc me  ralph lauren  giorgio armani  garnier  l oreal  maybelline  biotherm  helena rubinstein  redken  matrix  kiehl s since  shu uemura and other brands  unilever nv  which markets calvin klein  cerruti  vera wang  pond s  thermasilk  vaseline intensive care and other brands  the procter gamble company  which markets cover girl  olay  giorgio beverly hills  hugo boss  rochas  escada  max factor  vidal sassoon  pantene  clairol  wella  valentino  gucci  sebastian  aussie and other brands  beiersdorf ag  which markets nivea  eucerin  la prairie  juvena and other brands  avon products inc  a direct marketer of avon color  anew  skin so soft  mark  avon wellness  becoming and other products  shiseido company  ltd  which markets shiseido  cl de peau beaut  zirh  nars  decl or  issey miyake  jean paul gaultier  helene curtis  za and other brands  lvmh mo t hennessey louis vuitton lvmh  which markets christian dior  kenzo  givenchy  guerlain  benefit  make up for ever  fresh  aqua di parma and other brands  coty  inc  which markets lancaster  davidoff  isabella rossellini  rimmel  astor  adidas  the healing garden  chopard  jennifer lopez  kenneth cole  marc jacobs  stetson and other brands  revlon  inc  which markets revlon  almay  ultima ii and other brands  chanel  inc  clarins sa  which markets clarins  azzaro  herm s  lacoste  burberry  thierry mugler and other brands  and elizabeth arden  inc  which markets elizabeth arden  elizabeth taylor fragrances  geoffrey beene  halston  britney spears and other brands 
we also face competition from retailers that have developed their own brands  such as gap inc  which markets the gap and banana republic products  intimate brands  which markets victoria s secret beauty  bath and body works  and  in a venture with shiseido  aura science  and sephora 
some retailers have acquired brands  such as neiman marcus group  which acquired laura mercier 
some of our competitors also have ownership interests in retailers that are customers of ours 
for example  lvmh has interests in dfs group ltd  miami cruiseline services  le bon march  la samaritaine  eluxury and sephora

we believe that we are in substantial compliance with such regulations  as well as with applicable federal  state  local and international and other countries rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment 
there are no significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either planned in the current year or expected in the near future

see item legal proceedings 
seasonality our results of operations in total  by region and by product category  are subject to seasonal fluctuations  with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year 
the higher net sales in the first two fiscal quarters are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday selling season and for fall fashion makeup introductions 
fluctuations in net sales  operating income and product category results in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions 
additionally  gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter by quarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions  including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions

see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recently issued accounting standards 
additionally  in connection with this pronouncement  redeemable preferred stock has been reclassified as a component of total debt subsequent to june  the provisions of sfas no 
did not provide for retroactive restatement of historical financial data 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements 
these judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  concentration of credit risk  inventory  pension and other postretirement benefit costs  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  and derivatives 
revenue recognition generally  revenues from merchandise sales are recorded at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
we report our sales levels on a net sales basis  which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns 
as is customary in the cosmetics industry  our practice is to accept returns of our products from retailers if properly requested  authorized and approved 
in accepting returns  we typically provide a credit to the retailer against sales and accounts receivable from that retailer on a dollar for dollar basis 
our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales 
this accrual is calculated based on a history of gross sales and actual returns by region and product category 
in addition  as necessary  specific accruals may be established for future known or anticipated events 
as a percentage of gross sales  sales returns were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
concentration of credit risk an entity is vulnerable to concentration of credit risk if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risks through diversification of customers 
the significance of such credit risk depends on the extent and nature of the concentration 
we have three major customers that owned and operated retail stores that in the aggregate accounted for  million  or  of our consolidated net sales in fiscal and million  or  of our accounts receivable at june  these customers sell products primarily within north america 
although management believes that these customers are sound and creditworthy  a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales  cash flows and or financial condition 
in the ordinary course of business  we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of million and million as of june  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by million  million and million for customer deductions and write offs in fiscal  and  respectively  and increased by million  million and million for additional provisions in fiscal  and  respectively 
this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging  specific exposures and historical trends 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale 
the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products  promotional products  raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods 
inventory cost includes raw materials  direct labor and overhead 
we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve  which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value  based on various product sales projections 
this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age  historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales 
in addition  and as necessary  we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trust based noncontributory defined benefit pension plan us plan  an unfunded  nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations  a contributory defined contribution plan  international pension plans  which vary by country  consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  deferred compensation  and certain other postretirement benefits 
the amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables 
certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels 
we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges  although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 
the pre retirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long term bonds 
for fiscal  we used a pre retirement discount rate for our us plan of and varying rates on our international plans of between and 
for fiscal  we used an expected return on plan assets of for our us plan and varying rates of between and for our international plans 
in determining the long term rate of return for a plan  we consider the historical rates of return  the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies 
the us plan asset allocation as of june  was approximately equity investments  fixed income investments  and other investments 
for fiscal  we will use a pre retirement discount rate for the us plan of and anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of 
the net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal will cause a de minimis decrease in pension expense in fiscal we will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets 
other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized 
on an annual basis  we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing 
we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose 
to mitigate undue influence  we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   we have current net deferred tax assets of million and non current net deferred tax liabilities of million 
the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization  as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates 
included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately million for deferred tax assets  which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date  where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction 
based on our assessments  no additional valuation allowance is required 
if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time 
furthermore  we provide tax reserves for federal  state and international exposures relating to audit results  planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities 
the development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues  potential outcomes and timing  and is a subjective critical estimate 
derivatives we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
this statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value 
we currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest rates  as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
hedge effectiveness is documented  assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments 
variables that are external to us such as social  political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof 
results of operations we manufacture  market and sell skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over countries and territories 
the following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal  and and reflects the basis of presentation described in note and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category 
in february  we sold the assets and operations of our reporting unit that sold jane brand products 
prior to the sale of the business  in december  we committed to a plan to sell such assets and operations 
at the time the decision was made  circumstances warranted that we conduct an assessment of the tangible and intangible assets of the jane business 
based on our assessment  we determined that the carrying amount of these assets as then reflected on our consolidated balance sheet exceeded their estimated fair value 
in accordance with the assessment and the closing of the sale  we recorded an after tax charge to discontinued operations of million for the fiscal year ended june  the charge represents the impairment of goodwill in the amount of million  the reduction in value of other tangible assets in the amount of million  net of taxes  and the reporting unit s operating loss of million  net of tax 
included in the operating loss of the fiscal year were additional costs associated with the sale and discontinuation of the business

we have presented these reconciliations because of the special nature of the charges or the fact that they are not necessarily comparable from period to period 
we believe that such measures provide investors with a view of our ongoing business trends and results of continuing operations 
this is consistent with the approach used by management in its evaluation and monitoring of such trends and results and provides investors with a base for evaluating future periods 
there were no events or transactions in fiscal for which we believe such a presentation would be relevant 
while we consider the non gaap financial measures useful in analyzing our results  it is not intended to replace  or act as a substitute for  any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap 
fiscal the table below reconciles the fiscal results as reported and results prior to adjustment for a special pre tax charge of million  or million after tax  equal to 
per diluted common share  in connection with the proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit brought against us and a number of other defendants 
the amount of the charge in this case is significantly larger than similar charges we have incurred individually or in the aggregate for legal proceedings in any prior year and we do not expect to take a charge of a similar magnitude for a single matter like it in the near future

the restructuring charges were related to repositioning certain businesses as part of a globalization and reorganization initiative and are described in greater detail in note to notes to consolidated financial statements

excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  net sales increased 
product categories skin care net sales of skin care products increased or million to  million 
this increase was primarily attributable to the recent launches of hydra complete multi level moisture cream and idealist micro d deep thermal refinisher by est e lauder and pore minimizer by clinique 
additionally  the increase was supported by strong sales of clinique s step skin care system and the repairwear line of products from clinique as well as re nutriv intensive lift serum and re nutriv intensive eye cr me by est e lauder 
also contributing to this increase was the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the darphin line of products  which are primarily skin care  and growth in developing brands 
partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of certain existing products such as advanced stop signs by clinique and white light and lightsource product lines by est e lauder 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  skin care net sales increased 
makeup makeup net sales increased or million to  million  in part  due to strong sales of our m a c and bobbi brown makeup artist lines 
the increase in net sales also reflected the current year launches of ideal matte refinishing makeup spf and electric intense lipcreme by est e lauder and perfectly real makeup and colour surge bare brilliance by clinique 
also contributing to net sales growth were strong sales of high impact mascara  high impact eye shadow and skin clarifying makeup by clinique  as well as pure color lip vinyl and artist s lip and eye pencils from est e lauder 
partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of certain existing products such as so ingenious multi dimension liquid makeup and pure color lipstick from est e lauder and moisture surge lipstick from clinique 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  makeup net sales increased 
fragrance net sales of fragrance products increased or million to  million  primarily attributable to the current year launches of est e lauder beyond paradise  aramis life  clinique simply and the tommy jeans collection 
these product launches primarily contributed to increased fragrance net sales outside the united states 
additionally  the increase in net sales benefited from improved results from our travel retail business 
these net sales increases were partially offset by lower net sales of est e lauder pleasures  intuition and beautiful  certain tommy hilfiger products and clinique happy 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  fragrance net sales increased 
hair care hair care net sales increased or million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of sales growth from aveda and bumble and bumble products due to an increase in sales at existing salons and spas  new salon and spa openings and the success of new and existing products 
aveda net sales also increased as a result of the opening of new company owned aveda experience centers 
partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales of clinique s simple hair care system 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  hair care net sales increased 
the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products  which we take into account in our business planning 
geographic regions net sales in the americas increased or million to  million  primarily reflecting growth from our newer brands  the success of new and recently launched products and increases from most of the company s freestanding retail stores  all of which reflected the strengthening retail environment 
nevertheless  the prestige fragrance business in the united states continues to be challenging 
in europe  the middle east africa  net sales increased or million to  million  primarily reflecting higher net sales from our travel retail business  the united kingdom  spain  greece and south africa  as well as the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the darphin line of products 
we also benefited from the effect of favorable foreign currency exchange rates to the us dollar 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  net sales in europe  the middle east africa increased 
net sales in asia pacific increased or million to million  primarily due to higher net sales in japan  australia  taiwan  china and thailand 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  net sales in asia pacific increased 
we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market  which may account for differences in regional sales growth 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to from reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies of approximately basis points and lower costs from promotional activities of approximately basis points 
partially offsetting these improvements were changes in exchange rates of approximately basis points and costs related to inventory obsolescence and reconditioning and re handling of goods of approximately basis points 
also offsetting these improvements were costs associated with higher travel retail sales  which contributed approximately basis points 
travel retail has a higher cost of goods sold percentage because of its higher mix of fragrance sales coupled with its margin structure 
since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage 
in addition  future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different than our existing brands 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased to of net sales as compared with of net sales in the prior year 
prior year operating expenses included a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of million or of net sales 
before considering the effect of this charge  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points from in the prior year 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately basis points primarily due to the higher growth rate in net sales  particularly in the travel retail business  as well as our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs  partially offset by operating expenses related to beautybank  the higher operating costs associated with newly acquired brands and expenses related to compliance with new regulatory requirements such as those arising under the sarbanes oxley act of 
partially offsetting the net favorability in the current year were higher levels of advertising  merchandising and sampling expenses incurred to support new and recently launched products of approximately basis points 
changes in advertising  sampling and merchandising spending result from the type  timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts  as well as the markets being emphasized 
under agreements covering our purchase of trademarks for a percentage of related sales  royalty payments totaling million and million in fiscal and  respectively  have been charged to expense 
such payments were made to mrs 
est e lauder until her death on april   after which time the final payments ceased to accrue and were made to a trust 
this event resulted in a reduction of operating expenses in fiscal of million  or million after tax 
we will realize a benefit from the elimination of these royalty payments in fiscal operating results operating income increased or million to million 
operating margins were of net sales in the current period as compared with in the prior year 
prior year results include a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of million 
absent this charge  operating income increased or million and operating margins increased basis points from fiscal these increases in operating income and operating margin reflect sales growth  improvements in the components of cost of sales and a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 
net earnings and net earnings per diluted share increased approximately and  respectively 
net earnings improved million to million and net earnings per diluted share increased by from to 
net earnings from continuing operations increased by million or and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased to from in the prior year 
absent the charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding  net earnings from continuing operations increased by million or and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased from 
the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of the fiscal charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding 
we believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business 
the table on page reconciles these results to operating income as reported in the consolidated statements of earnings 
product categories operating income increased to million in skin care  to million in makeup and to million in hair care reflecting overall sales growth and new product launches 
operating income decreased to million in fragrance reflecting the softness in that product category in the united states as well as increased support spending related to new product launch activities 
geographic regions operating income in the americas increased or million to million due to sales growth resulting from an improved retail environment  strong product launches and growth from newer brands 
in europe  the middle east africa  operating income increased or million to million primarily due to significantly improved results from our travel retail business  improved operating results in the united kingdom and spain as well as the addition of a full year of results of the darphin line of products 
partially offsetting these increases were lower results in switzerland and italy due to difficult market conditions 
in asia pacific  operating income increased or million to million 
this increase reflects improved results in taiwan  hong kong and thailand  partially offset by lower results in korea 
interest expense  net net interest expense was million as compared with million in the prior year 
the increase in net interest expense was due to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock of million as interest expense in fiscal this change in reporting resulted from a change in accounting standards which prohibits us from restating the prior fiscal year results see recently issued accounting standards 
to a lesser extent  interest expense was also affected by higher average net borrowings and a marginally higher effective interest rate on our debt portfolio 
in fiscal  we expect a reduction in interest expense as a result of the partial redemption of preferred stock and the lower dividend rate on the remaining preferred stock compared to fiscal see liquidity and capital resources for further details 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local income taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal was as compared with in the prior year 
these rates differ from statutory rates  reflecting the effect of state and local taxes  tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses 
the increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock as interest expense  which are not deductible for income tax purposes  the mix of global earnings and  to a lesser extent  the timing of certain tax planning initiatives 
the prior year rate included benefits derived from certain favorable tax negotiations 
fiscal as compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased or million to  million  reflecting growth in all product categories and each of our geographic regions 
product category results were led by skin care  and our regions were led by europe  the middle east africa  where results benefited from favorable foreign exchange rates to the us dollar and improvements in the travel retail business 
travel retail improved during the middle of fiscal compared with lower results during the middle of fiscal but was adversely affected during the last quarter of fiscal by certain world events  including the lingering effects of the war in iraq and concerns relating to sars 
such events may affect our future sales and earnings 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  net sales increased product categories skin care net sales of skin care products increased or million to  million  which was primarily attributable to the recent launches of perfectionist correcting serum for lines wrinkles and resilience lift overnight face and throat cr me by est e lauder  and the repairwear line of products and advanced stop signs from clinique 
additionally  the increase was supported by strong sales of comforting cream cleanser  moisture surge extra thirsty skin relief and moisture surge eye gel  and products in the step skin care system by clinique  as well as by re nutriv ultimate lifting creme from est e lauder  and a perfect world line of products by origins 
partially offsetting this increase were lower net sales of certain existing products such as stop signs  total turnaround cream and turnaround cream by clinique and idealist skin refinisher by est e lauder 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  skin care net sales increased makeup makeup net sales increased or million to  million due to strong sales of our makeup artist lines and fiscal launches of dewy smooth anti aging makeup and colour surge lipstick by clinique  and magnascopic maximum volume mascara and artist s lip and eye pencils from est e lauder 
also contributing to growth were strong sales from est e lauder brand products including so ingenious multi dimension liquid makeup and loose powder  as well as from new and existing products in the pure color line 
offsetting this increase were lower net sales of certain existing products such as sumptuous lipstick from est e lauder  and gentle light makeup and powder and high impact eye shadow duos by clinique 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  makeup net sales increased 
fragrance net sales of fragrance products increased or million to  million  primarily reflecting the effects of favorable foreign currency exchange rates to the us dollar 
the fragrance industry continues to experience a difficult environment 
the travel retail business  which depends substantially on fragrance products  began to improve in the middle of the fiscal year relative to the prior year  however the latter part of fiscal was adversely affected by international uncertainties stemming from events in iraq and concerns relating to sars 
in fiscal  we successfully launched est e lauder pleasures intense  t girl by tommy hilfiger  clinique happy heart  lauder intuition for men and donna karan black cashmere 
net sales also benefited from strong sales of beautiful by est e lauder and aromatics elixir from clinique 
offsetting these increases and sales from new product launches were lower net sales of certain tommy hilfiger products  intuition by est e lauder and est e lauder pleasures 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  fragrance net sales were relatively unchanged from the prior year 
hair care hair care net sales increased or million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of sales growth from aveda and bumble and bumble products 
we also increased the number of company owned aveda experience centers and strategically decreased the number of salons that offer aveda products 
partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales of clinique s simple hair care system 
the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products  which we take into account in our business planning 
geographic regions net sales in the americas increased or million to  million primarily reflecting growth from our newer brands as well as the success of newly launched products 
despite the increase  we continued to experience a soft retail environment in the united states in fiscal in europe  the middle east africa  net sales increased or million to  million 
net sales in the united kingdom  spain  italy  france  switzerland and greece experienced double digit growth 
also contributing to the increase with double digit growth was our worldwide travel retail business  as sales recovered from the levels experienced after september  however  our travel retail business was adversely affected at the end of fiscal by certain world events including the lingering effects of the war in iraq and concerns associated with sars 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  europe  the middle east africa net sales increased 
net sales in asia pacific increased or million to million primarily due to higher net sales in korea  japan  australia and thailand 
despite increased net sales in japan  the country remained a difficult market due to local economic conditions and competition 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  asia pacific net sales increased 
we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market  which may account for differences in regional sales growth 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to from  reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies and lower costs from promotional activities 
we continued to emphasize sourcing initiatives and overall supply chain management which resulted in lower manufacturing costs  whereas in the prior year we experienced under absorption of overhead as a result of the impact of the events of september  the inclusion of promotional merchandise as a component of cost of sales results in lower margins 
a strategic shift to reduce these activities in fiscal contributed to the improvement in our gross profit margin for the year 
the inclusion of the cost of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase merchandise as a component of cost of sales resulted from our adoption of eitf issue no 
since the cost of these promotional activities is a component of cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar  we experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased to of net sales as compared with of net sales in the prior year period 
the fiscal results were impacted by a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of million or of net sales 
fiscal operating expenses included a restructuring charge of million or of net sales 
before considering the effect of these two charges  operating expenses increased slightly to of net sales compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the increase in spending primarily related to advertising  sampling and merchandising activities particularly during the early portion of fiscal excluding purchase with purchase and gift with purchase activities  discussed as a component of cost of sales which supported our sales growth and built momentum going into the second half of fiscal changes in advertising  sampling and merchandising spending result from the type  timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts  as well as the markets being emphasized 
operating results operating income increased or million to million as compared with the prior year period 
operating margins were of net sales in fiscal as compared with in fiscal these results include a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of million in the current year and a prior year restructuring charge of million 
absent these items  operating income increased or million to million and operating margins increased to as compared with in fiscal these increases in operating income and operating margin reflect sales growth  including the benefits from favorable foreign currency exchange rates to the us dollar and gross margin improvement  as well as benefits from our prior restructurings and our continued cost containment efforts 
net earnings and net earnings per diluted share increased approximately and  respectively 
net earnings improved million to million and net earnings per diluted share increased by 
from 
to 
net earnings from continuing operations increased by million or and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased to from 
in the prior year 
before the fiscal charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding and the fiscal restructuring  net earnings from continuing operations increased to million and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased to from in the prior year 
the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of the fiscal charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding and the fiscal restructuring 
we believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business 
the tables on page reconcile these results to operating income as reported in the consolidated statements of earnings 
product categories operating income more than doubled to million in fragrance due primarily to improved results from our travel retail business 
operating income increased to million in skin care and to million in makeup reflecting higher net sales  partially offset by strategic spending on advertising  sampling and merchandising  particularly in the earlier portion of fiscal operating income increased million or to million in hair care  reflecting improvements in aveda and bumble and bumble  as well as higher profits in the latter portion of the year outside the united states 
geographic regions operating income in the americas increased or million to million due to sales growth  the benefits of our prior restructurings and continued cost containment efforts 
operating income also benefited from the results of strategic efforts related to product support spending in the earlier part of the year that led to increased net sales during the year 
in europe  the middle east africa  operating income increased or million to million primarily due to the improved operating results in the united kingdom as well as increased results generated from our travel retail business 
as described elsewhere  profitability in the region has been and will continue to be affected by international uncertainties 
in asia pacific  operating income decreased or million to million 
this decrease reflects improved results in korea and thailand  which were more than offset by a decrease in australia  which derived a benefit in the prior year period from a change in our retailer arrangements 
interest expense  net net interest expense was million as compared with million in fiscal the decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower outstanding net borrowings and higher interest income generated by higher invested cash balances 
this improvement was partially offset by a higher effective interest rate  which resulted from the increased proportion of fixed rate debt as compared with variable rate debt in the prior year 
in may  we executed a fixed to floating interest rate swap on our million senior notes due see liquidity and capital resources for further details 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local income taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal was as compared with in fiscal these rates differ from statutory rates  reflecting the effect of state and local taxes  tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was principally attributable to ongoing tax planning initiatives  including the favorable settlement of certain tax negotiations and the reduction of the overall tax rate relating to the company s foreign operations 
in addition  the tax effect of the charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding in late fiscal contributed to an effective tax rate slightly lower than previously expected 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper  borrowings from the issuance of long term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks in the united states and abroad 
at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared with million at june  at june   our outstanding borrowings of million included i million of senior notes due january consisting of million principal  unamortized debt discount of million and a million adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap  ii million of senior notes due october consisting of million principal and unamortized debt discount of million  iii million of cumulative redeemable preferred stock  which shares have a mandatory redemption date of june  see recently issued accounting standards  iv a billion yen term loan approximately million at exchange rates as of june   which is due in march  and v million of other short term borrowings 
in september  we issued and sold million of senior notes due october senior notes in a public offering 
the senior notes were priced at with a yield of 
interest payments  which commenced april   will be made semi annually on april and october of each year 
in may  in anticipation of the issuance of the senior notes  we entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling million at a weighted average all in rate of 
the treasury lock agreements were settled upon the issuance of the new debt and we received a payment of million that will be amortized against interest expense over the life of the senior notes 
as a result of the treasury lock agreements  the debt discount and debt issuance costs  our effective interest rate on the senior notes will be over the life of the debt 
we issued these fixed rate notes to lock in long term liquidity at historically low prevailing market rates and to mitigate future interest rate volatility 
on december   we and the holders of the cumulative redeemable preferred stock exchanged all of the outstanding shares of cumulative redeemable preferred stock due june  for a newly issued series of cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a mandatory redemption date of june  preferred stock 
for the quarters ended december  and march   the dividend rate on the preferred stock was per annum  payable quarterly 
on april   mrs 
est e lauder passed away 
as a result  our right to call for redemption million of the preferred stock became exercisable and the holders right to put to us all million aggregate principal amount of the preferred stock became exercisable 
on june   we redeemed  for cash  all million aggregate principal amount of preferred stock that could be redeemed at that time 
upon this partial redemption  the dividend rate on the remaining million principal amount of preferred stock was reduced  for the period from april  through june   from per annum to per annum  which is a rate based on the after tax yield on six month us treasuries 
so long as the remaining shares of preferred stock are outstanding  the dividend rate will be reset semi annually in january and july at the then existing after tax yield on six month us treasuries 
the dividend rate for the six month period from july  through december  is 
as a result of the redemption of the million principal amount of preferred stock and the reduction of the dividend rate on the remaining million principal amount of preferred stock  we expect to save  net of financing costs  approximately million in fiscal the remaining million principal amount of preferred stock may be put to us at any time at face value  but may not be redeemed by us until may  if put to us on or before june   we would have up to days after the exercise date of the put to pay for the shares 
if the remaining shares of preferred stock are put to us or if we call those shares for redemption  we expect to use cash on hand to fund the redemption 
we have a million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states 
our commercial paper is currently rated a by standard poor s and p by moody s 
our long term credit ratings are a with a negative outlook by standard poor s and a with a stable outlook by moody s 
at june   we had no commercial paper outstanding 
we also have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to an additional million in debt securities 
as of june   we had an unused million revolving credit facility  expiring on june   and million in additional uncommitted credit facilities  of which million was used 
our business is seasonal in nature and  accordingly  our working capital needs vary 
from time to time  we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding 
to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations  we could  subject to market conditions  issue commercial paper  issue long term debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility 
total debt as a percent of total capitalization was at june  as compared with at june  this increase primarily reflects the classification of the preferred stock as short term debt as well as the issuance of the senior notes in fiscal the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years 
generally  we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases  which have been moderate 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from operations  available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a near term and long term basis 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the improved operating cash flow primarily reflects increased net earnings from continuing operations and an increase in accrued costs 
changes in operating assets and liabilities reflect partially offsetting increases in accounts payable and inventory in anticipation of product launches in fiscal  higher accounts receivable in line with sales growth  and changes in other assets and accrued liabilities that reflect receipts and accruals from employee compensation and benefit related transactions as well as selling  advertising and merchandising activities 
we expect cash flows from operations in fiscal to reflect payments of approximately million  net of tax  related to deferred compensation and supplemental pension arrangements 
the improvement in net cash flows for fiscal compared to fiscal reflected increased earnings and seasonal levels of operating assets and liabilities 
operating assets and liabilities reflected an improvement in accounts receivable collections in fiscal  and a higher level of accounts payable  partially offset by increased inventories at june  in anticipation of product launches in the first half of fiscal and the impact of acquisitions on required inventory levels 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in fiscal primarily related to capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal primarily related to capital expenditures and the acquisition of darphin and certain aveda distributors 
net cash used in fiscal related primarily to capital expenditures 
capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
spending in all three years primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment  dies and molds  new store openings  store improvements  counter construction and information technology enhancements 
in fiscal  we expect our capital expenditures to increase as a result of a company wide initiative to upgrade our financial systems as well as our plan to invest in leasehold improvements in our corporate offices 
the reduced level of capital expenditures in fiscal reflected tight control on our spending in light of then prevailing economic conditions  fewer retail store openings and reduced spending related to leasehold improvements 
cash used for financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the net cash used for financing activities in fiscal primarily related to the redemption of million aggregate principal amount of the preferred stock  common stock repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and employee stock transactions 
net cash used for financing during fiscal and fiscal primarily related to common stock repurchases  the repayment of long term debt and dividend payments 
dividends on november   the board of directors declared an annual dividend of 
per share on our class a and class b common stock  payable on january  to stockholders of record at the close of business on december  common stock dividends paid during the fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
dividends paid on the preferred stock were million for the year ended june  and million for the years ended june  and the decrease reflects an agreement to reduce the dividend of the preferred stock made in connection with the exchange of the preferred shares on december  and the redemption of million aggregate principal amount of preferred stock on june  the dividend rate on the remaining million principal amount of preferred stock was reduced  for the period from april  through june   from per annum to per annum  which is a rate based on the after tax yield on six month us treasuries 
the dividend rate for the six month period july  through december  is 
so long as the remaining shares of preferred stock are outstanding  the dividend rate will be reset semi annually in january and july at the then existing after tax yield on six month us treasuries 
the cumulative redeemable preferred stock dividends declared for the year ended june  have been characterized as interest expense see recently issued accounting standards 
pension plan funding and expense we maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our full time employees for our us operations and a majority of our international operations 
several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees earnings 
in the united states  we maintain a trust based  noncontributory defined benefit pension plan us plan 
additionally  we have an unfunded  nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations 
our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans 
several factors influence our annual funding requirements 
for the us plan  our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages 
such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes 
for each international plan  our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations 
in addition  amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in critical accounting polices and estimates 
the effect on operating results in the future of pension plan funding will depend on economic conditions  employee demographics  mortality rates  the number of participants electing to take lump sum distributions  investment performance and funding decisions 
for fiscal and there was no minimum contribution to the us plan required by erisa 
however  at management s discretion  we made cash contributions to the us plan of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
depending upon market conditions during fiscal  we expect to make cash contributions to our us plan of million 
in addition  at june  and  we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the accumulated benefit obligation and  accordingly  a benefit or a charge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
during fiscal  we recorded a benefit  net of deferred tax  of million  while in fiscal  we recorded a charge  net of deferred tax  of million to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
commitments and contingencies on june   we redeemed all million aggregate principal amount of preferred stock that could be redeemed at that time 
the remaining million principal amount of preferred stock may be put to us at any time at face value  but may not be redeemed by us until may  if shares of the preferred stock are put to us on or before june   we would have up to days after notice to purchase such shares 
certain of our business acquisition agreements include earn out provisions 
these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business 
the payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our next earn out payment is expected to be made after the end of fiscal since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business  we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june  payments due in fiscal total thereafter in millions long term debt including current portion lease commitments unconditional purchase obligations deferred compensation total contractual obligations refer to notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
includes operating lease commitments  and to a lesser extent  minimal capital lease commitments 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments  estimated future earn out payments  estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements  advertising commitments and capital improvement commitments 
share units that were recorded as a component of stockholders equity as of june  have been converted to the cash equivalent value and placed in a deferred compensation account in fiscal based on a decision of the compensation committee of the board of directors in august derivative financial instruments and hedging activities we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates 
we categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading 
for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment  we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value  cash flow  or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items 
if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective  then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 
foreign exchange risk management we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries 
almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 
we also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize 
the forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges 
as of june   these cash flow hedges were highly effective  in all material respects 
as a matter of policy  we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an a or equivalent credit rating 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
we do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized  but not realized  gains attributable to the contracts 
management believes risk of default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results 
the contracts have varying maturities through the end of june costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at june   we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the euro million  swiss franc million  british pound million  japanese yen million  south korean won million  canadian dollar million  and australian dollar million 
the foreign currencies included in the option contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the euro million  british pound million  and swiss franc million 
interest rate risk management we enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness  as well as cash investments  for periods consistent with the identified exposures 
all interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 
we have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing million senior notes to variable interest rates based on six month libor 
we designated the swap as a fair value hedge 
as of june   the fair value hedge was highly effective  in all material respects 
additionally  in may  in connection with the anticipated issuance of debt  we entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling million at a weighted average all in rate of 
these treasury lock agreements were used to hedge the exposure to a possible rise in interest rates prior to the september issuance of debt 
the agreements were settled upon the issuance of the million of senior notes and we realized a gain in other comprehensive income of million that is currently being amortized against interest expense over the year life of the senior notes 
market risk we use a value at risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments 
value at risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level 
we estimate value at risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past day period 
the measured value at risk  calculated as an average  for the twelve months ended june  related to our foreign exchange contracts and our interest rate contracts was million and million  respectively 
the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a percent confidence level 
we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 
our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results  which may or may not occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 
we believe  however  that any loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the hedge is intended 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations

in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation number r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r  which modifies certain provisions and effective dates of fin  sets forth criteria to be used in determining whether an investment in a variable interest entity should be consolidated 
these provisions are based on the general premise that if a company controls another entity through interests other than voting interests  that company should consolidate the controlled entity 
we have evaluated whether the provisions of fin r are applicable to our investments  certain of which are currently accounted for by the equity method  as well as other arrangements  which may meet the criteria of the interpretation  and believe that there are currently no material arrangements that meet the definition of a variable interest entity which would require consolidation

initial and subsequent measurements of the instruments differ based on the characteristics of each instrument and as provided for in the statement 
based on the provisions of this statement  we have classified the cumulative redeemable preferred stock as a liability and the related dividends thereon have been characterized as interest expense 
restatement of financial statements for earlier years presented was not permitted 
the adoption of this statement has resulted in the inclusion of the dividends on the preferred stock equal to million for the year ended june  as interest expense 
while the inclusion has impacted net earnings  net earnings attributable to common stock and earnings per common share were unaffected 
given that the dividends are not deductible for income tax purposes  the inclusion of the preferred stock dividends as an interest expense has caused an increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our financial condition
