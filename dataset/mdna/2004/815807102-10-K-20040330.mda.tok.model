table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management revenue recognition the company follows the guidance in statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  in recognizing revenue on software transactions 
sop requires that revenue allocated to software products  specified upgrades and enhancements is recognized upon delivery of the related products  upgrades or enhancements 
revenue allocated by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe to post contract customer support maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the support  and revenue allocated by vsoe to service elements training and consulting is recognized as the services are performed 
the residual method of revenue recognition is used for multi element arrangements when the vsoe of the fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is recognized as follows the total fair value of the undelivered elements  as indicated by vsoe  is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with relevant sections of sop and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
the company recognizes revenue from software licenses upon the receipt of a signed purchase order contract  product delivery  assessment that collection is probable  and the other revenue recognition criteria of sop are met 
the company s software products do not require significant modification  customization or installation 
post contract customer support maintenance and service revenue training and consulting that is not yet earned is included in deferred revenue 
with respect to the determination of vsoe for multi element arrangements  the company follows the guidance within paragraph of sop the company uses the residual method of revenue recognition as provided for in paragraph of sop  as amended by sop the company does a thorough review of the vsoe for maintenance  training and consulting semi annually 
in all instances the vsoe is defined as the objective  verifiable price when the same item is sold separately 
the company determines vsoe for post contract support maintenance using a consistent percentage of list price method for product categories  which approximates the maintenance renewal rates and is considered to be substantive 
the company determines the vsoe for training classes and consulting services using objective verifiable evidence of these items when sold separately

the estimate for the million loss on unused space was based on information that was available at that time 
factors that were included were anticipated rental rates in the local commercial office market and the estimated timeframe in which we expected to sublease the space 
segue obtained local real estate market data and consulted with its real estate advisor on these factors to help determine an appropriate reserve for potential losses on the unused space 
during the fourth quarter of  segue was able to reach an agreement in principle with its landlord to restructure the sublease for our lexington facility 
a formal agreement was consummated on january  at december   the accrual balance related to the obligations associated with all of the excess office space in both the lexington and los gatos facilities is approximately million 
this is comprised of an estimated million for future rents payable by segue on unoccupied space less approximately  of estimated future sublease income 
segue is under a restructured sublease for the lexington facility until october goodwill as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  segue discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective january  goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill resulted from segue s acquisition of sqlbench in december and was being amortized using the straight line method over five years 
as further required by sfas no 
 segue performs an analysis of the transitional fair value of the goodwill annually during the fourth quarter and will adjust the value of the goodwill should the calculated transitional fair value of the goodwill be less than that reported on the company s consolidated balance sheet

services revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
maintenance revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of

cost of software was  for the year ended december   or of software revenues  compared to  for the year ended december   or of software revenues 
the decrease of  was primarily attributable to a reduction of  in personnel related costs due to a reduced number of employees  a reduction of  in reseller referral fee commissions  and a reduction of  in royalty expenses

cost of maintenance was million for the year ended december   or of net revenues  compared to million for the year ended december   or of net revenues 
an increase of  in exchange rate translation in the european market of our foreign technical support operations and an increase of  in personnel related costs were offset by a decrease of  in telephone expenses due to cost saving measures in and a decrease of  in depreciation as a result of fully depreciated assets in our northern ireland technical support center

segue will continue to tightly control the level of expenses for marketing programs  but further reductions to these may have an adverse effect on our business by not creating enough leads to generate sales revenue 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will continue to be a large percent of total expenses for segue  although their percent to total revenue may vary in the future  as we try to grow revenue faster than expenses 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and allocated facility costs 
to date  all of segue s internal costs for research and development have been charged to operations as incurred  since amounts of software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant

cost of maintenance decreased to million in from million in lower personnel costs of  due to the restructuring that was completed in  were offset slightly by higher phone and data expenses totaling  for our northern ireland technical support center 
the company continues to shift support responsibilities to the global technical support center in northern ireland  where operating expenses are generally lower than in the united states 
support costs and personnel levels are continually reviewed in light of maintaining the quality of customer care 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions  travel costs and promotional marketing programs 
marketing programs include advertising  public relations  direct mail programs  seminars and trade shows 
total sales and marketing expenses decreased to million  or of net revenue  in compared to million  or of net revenue  in the company realized significant reductions in sales expense for due to reduced personnel costs of million associated with the restructuring actions that occurred in   reduction in commissions due to lower revenue  and significantly lower variable expenses of million 
these variable expenses include reductions of  in travel   in phone expense   in training and seminars  and  in rent and depreciation 
total sales expense for decreased by to million from million in in addition  the company was able to reduce overall marketing expenses in by to million from million in an  decrease in marketing personnel related costs in was a major factor  as well as a significant reduction in marketing programs of million  which includes advertising  promotional materials  creative services and trade shows 
segue will continue to watch the level of expenses for marketing programs  but further reductions to these may have an adverse effect on our business by not creating enough leads to generate sales revenue 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will continue to be a large percent of total expenses for segue  although their percent to total revenue may vary in the future  as we try to grow revenue faster than expenses 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and facility costs 
to date  all of segue s internal costs for research and development have been charged to operations as incurred  since amounts of software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant 
research and development expenses decreased to million  or of net revenue  in compared to million  or of net revenue in the decreases are attributable mainly to a reduction in personnel related costs 
table of contents of million due to the impact of the restructuring action  specifically the workforce reductions that occurred in  including the closing of our development lab in california during general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for executive  finance  legal  information technology  human resources and administrative personnel  professional fees  system support costs and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of net revenue  in compared to million  or of net revenue  in the decrease in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to the following decreased personnel related costs of million as a result of the restructurings that occurred in  a significant decrease in bad debt expense of  due to the recovery of several large accounts in  a  reduction in temporary personnel and consulting expenses and reduced travel expenses of  these reductions were offset by a  increase in legal expense related to our lease negotiations 
amortization of goodwill goodwill resulted from segue s acquisition of sqlbench in december however  as required by sfas no 
 segue discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective january  during the year ended december   segue performed an initial analysis of the transitional fair value of the goodwill and re evaluated the fair value of the goodwill during the fourth quarter of the analysis demonstrated that no impairment existed at january  or december  and no adjustment was made 
segue will re evaluate the fair value of the goodwill during the fourth quarter of we do not expect any future impairment loss that may occur to exceed million  which amount reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for the year ended december   amortization of goodwill was million 
restructuring charges during the first quarter of  segue executed a restructuring plan 
the restructuring included a reduction in workforce of approximately in the quarter 
as a result  segue recognized restructuring and other charges of approximately  the restructuring charges included approximately  for severance and other employee related costs for the termination of employees and approximately  for facility related costs 
the facility related costs included the accrual of estimated lease obligations associated with the excess office facilities in our lexington office  net of anticipated subleasing income 
during the second quarter of  the company accrued an additional  for restructuring charges reflecting an incremental estimated loss associated with additional excess space that the company made available in its lexington facility  in anticipation of a sublease transaction that the company was negotiating 
in the third quarter of  segue recorded a restructuring charge of  for an increase in the estimate of the loss associated with excess office facilities  due to a delay in the signing of the restructured sublease 
the company signed an amendment with the landlord q and no additional charges were accrued 
this revised sublease was executed on january  for the twelve month period ended december   segue recorded approximately million in restructuring charges as compared to million in during  we paid approximately  for the severance and termination benefits associated with the restructuring activities from the current and prior years 
as of december   we accrued approximately  for severance and benefits related to restructuring activities 
segue executed another restructuring plan in the second quarter of the restructuring included a reduction in workforce  the closing of the research and development laboratory in the los gatos  california office with a shifting of some resources to segue s austrian facility  consolidation of space in segue s lexington and los gatos facilities and the elimination of segue s inside sales organization in favor of a new enterprise oriented sales model and process 
as a result  segue recognized restructuring and other 
table of contents charges of approximately million 
the restructuring and other charges included approximately million for facility related costs  which included the accrual of estimated lease obligations associated with the closure of excess office facilities net of anticipated subleasing income  and approximately  for severance  and other employee related costs for the termination of employees 
near the end of the third quarter of  segue executed an additional restructuring plan in light of the deteriorating economic conditions 
the restructuring included a reduction in workforce and further consolidation of space in segue s lexington facility 
as a result  segue recognized restructuring and other charges of approximately million in the third quarter 
the restructuring and other charges included approximately  for severance and other employee related costs for the termination of employees and approximately million for facility related costs  including the accrual of estimated lease obligations associated with excess office facilities  net of anticipated subleasing income 
during  we paid approximately million for the severance and termination benefits associated with the restructuring actions from the second and third quarter 
at december   we had approximately  accrued for severance and benefits associated with both quarters restructuring actions 
other income expense other income and expense consist primarily of interest income and expense 
interest income from cash  cash equivalents and short term investments amounted to approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income is mainly a result of lower average balances of cash and short term investments and lower interest rates received on those investments 
the company had no interest expense for both the years ended december  and segue carries no debt and the notes payable  which resulted from the acquisition of sql bench  were paid off at the end of december provision for income taxes segue recorded a provision for foreign and state income taxes of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there was no tax benefit for losses generated in the united states during and due to the uncertainty of realizing such benefits 
management has evaluated the positive and negative evidence impacting the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
based on the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  the deferred tax assets have been fully reserved 
management re evaluates the positive and negative evidence on a quarterly basis 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
an additional  of restricted cash was posted in late as security for the letter of credit related to our restructured sublease and is shown in other assets on our balance sheet at december  and our operating activities generated cash of  in  compared to million cash utilized in in  cash generated primarily resulted from our net loss of million  adjusted for million in depreciation of fixed assets  an increase of  in deferred revenue and an increase of  in other current assets  offset by a decrease of  in accounts receivable  a decrease of  in accounts payable and a decrease of  in accrued expenses 
our investing activities generated cash of  in  compared to million in cash generated in  primarily came from a decrease of  in other assets partially offset by purchases in property and equipment  as compared to  which primarily came from maturing short term investments 
we purchased approximately  of property and equipment in compared to  in in 
table of contents the future  segue may need to make increased expenditures on property and equipment as present equipment ages 
our financing activities provided cash of million in  compared to million in on october   the company completed a preferred stock offering of  shares of preferred c stock to s associates and dr 
howard morgan and received  as proceeds from such offering 
on november   the company received million in proceeds from the sale of  shares of preferred c stock to a private investor 
in  the company sold to s associates  shares of preferred b stock for a payment of million 
please refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in this form k for more detailed financial information about this transaction 
further  in  the company raised approximately  from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan as compared to  in the decrease in the amount of cash from the exercise of stock options is the result of fewer exercises of employee stock options because of segue s lower stock price in we have historically had losses 
this  accompanied by the economic downturn of and the slowdown of information technology capital spending  has resulted in lower sales volume  which has required segue to continue utilizing significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents to fund operations  except in  when we generated positive cash flow from operations 
however  the effects of the steps taken by management have significantly reduced the company s future expected cash outflow 
furthermore  on january   the company received approval to restructure its sublease by returning approximately  square feet in its lexington facility to the landlord 
the restructured sublease will result in a positive cash impact of over  annually for the next years 
pursuant to the terms of the restructuring segue has posted an initial letter of credit for  the cash security of  letter of credit plus that was posted is classified as restricted cash and is reflected in other assets on the company s balance sheet 
this required letter of credit will reduce over time  by formula  to zero by august as a result of these actions for  cash generated from operations was positive 
long term cash requirements  other than for normal operating expenses and those described above  are anticipated for the development of new software products and enhancements of existing products  and the possible acquisition of software products or technologies complementary to our business 
we have reduced our workforce and overhead expenses as described above and minimized capital spending and other uses of cash 
but  in order to achieve and sustain profitability and to continue positive cash flow from operations  segue must maintain or grow its revenue 
assuming that segue can execute on current plans to maintain or grow revenue through its restructured sales program  its focus on enterprise customers  and its introduction and success of new and enhanced products  and the business climate for it spending does not worsen  we believe that with the funding described above  plus current cash and cash equivalents  that segue will have sufficient resources to meet its working capital and debt requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  if we are not able to maintain current business levels or the economy worsens  we may need to take other actions in order to fund our working capital requirements 
additionally  the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts  and classification and amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should segue be unable to continue funding its operations 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 
risks and factors that may affect future results set forth below are certain risk factors that could harm our business prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
you should carefully read the following risk factors  together with the financial statements  related notes and other information contained in this form k 
this form k contains forward looking 
table of contents statements that contain risks and uncertainties 
please refer to the discussion of forward looking statements on page in connection with your consideration of the risk factors and other important factors that may affect future results described below 
our quarterly results may fluctuate 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
our quarterly revenue may fluctuate significantly for several reasons  including the timing and success of introductions of our new products or product enhancements or those of our competitors  decline of the general business climate  including the uncertainty of it spending  competition and pricing  customer order deferrals or reductions in the size of individual orders as a result of general business conditions  ability to increase sales from enterprise companies  and general economic conditions 
substantial portions of our operating expenses are related to personnel  facilities and marketing and sales programs 
the level of spending for such expenses can not be adjusted quickly and is based  in significant part  on our expectations of future revenues 
if actual revenue levels are below management s expectations  results of operations are likely to be adversely affected 
furthermore  we have often recognized a substantial portion of our product license revenues in the last month of a quarter  with these revenues frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
as a result  product license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in the latter part of that quarter and revenues for any future quarter are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
we typically do not experience order backlog 
for these reasons  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we may not be profitable in the future 
since we began operations  we have generally experienced losses 
losses have resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  in the fourth quarter of  we reported net income of  but in each of the quarters of we reported net losses of    and  respectively 
it is uncertain whether we can return to profitability in the future 
for the fiscal year ended december   we had total revenue of million versus million in the fiscal year ended december  during and  we initiated aggressive cost saving measures in an effort to reduce expenses  enhance the possibility of profitability  and conserve cash  and we have sustained these measures through december  despite these cost saving measures  our future profitability remains uncertain because of  among other items  the uncertainty of our revenue from quarter to quarter 
failure to achieve profitability may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
business conditions and information technology it spending could cause further decline in revenue 
the level of future it spending remains very uncertain particularly in light of the decline in the business climate throughout and the decline in it spending over this two year period has negatively impacted our profitability 
if it spending does not increase  our revenues could be further adversely impacted 
we may not derive substantial incremental revenue from our alliances and silkelite partner program 
in an effort to augment product revenue derived from the efforts of our direct sales force  we have focused on expanding our key strategic alliances and on building a successful silkelite partner program 
we have built alliances with peoplesoft  keynote systems  borland software and microsoft 
the silkelite partners program focuses on resellers  consulting partners and distributors 
silkelite partners resell our products  refer business to segue and use our software products in the delivery of consulting services 
the success of the key strategic alliances and the silkelite program is uncertain  faces strong competition  and takes time and significant resources to develop 
should we fail to generate substantial incremental revenue from our strategic alliances or our silkelite program  our financial results and stock price could be adversely affected 
the silkelite partner program accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december  versus for the year ended december  the effect of the change in the ibm relationship is uncertain 
in  we signed an expanded contract with ibm corporation under which we were the exclusive external provider of software for ibm global 
table of contents infrastructure and systems management services igssms new remote infrastructure analysis offering 
in the first quarter of  ibm s igssms advised us that it would no longer be offering the remote monitoring service  which was powered by our silkvision software 
we paid million to accelerate the implementation of this service 
in october  we negotiated the termination of this portion of the ibm contract and the return of  of the investment not spent by ibm in the deployment of this service 
in addition  in the second quarter of  ibm tivoli advised us of the cancellation of the royalty contract signed by both companies in september of tivoli was expected to integrate our silktest software into a larger tivoli product suite  and we were to have received a royalty each time tivoli sold its product suite 
ibm acquired rational software in february and accordingly  ibm tivoli has decided to use a rational software testing tool in place of our tool 
we had the potential to receive up to million in remaining royalties over the next several years 
the impact of these events on the remaining ibm relationship and future revenue is uncertain and may adversely affect our future results 
our future success will depend on our ability to respond rapidly and effectively to technological and other market changes  including the successful introduction of new and enhanced products 
the nature of the automated software testing  performance management and application monitoring markets in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology  rapidly evolving customer needs and desires  changes in industry standards and practices and frequent releases of new product or enhancements by competitors 
to be competitive  we must develop and introduce product enhancements and new products that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and potential customers 
for the fiscal year ended december   over of our product revenues were generated from our silkperformer and silktest products  as compared with over in same period last year 
during the quarter ended september   we released silkvision  the newest version of our powerful web based enterprise monitoring software  and silkperformer  the newest version of our enterprise class load and stress testing tool 
during the fourth quarter of  we released silktest our newest version of functional testing with add on support available to test 
net applications 
if these new products are not successful or if we fail to continue to develop and introduce new products and enhancements on a timely basis  or maintain our level of product revenue from silkperformer and silktest  or fail to generate substantial incremental revenue from our new products  our business may be materially adversely affected 
we may face liquidity issues 
we have taken steps to conserve our use of cash  including significantly reducing headcount  infrastructure and other expenses  and limiting capital expenditures in order to compensate in part for our recent decline in revenues  to improve our liquidity and to achieve greater efficiencies 
we believe that based on expense savings and the stability of our revenue in the last year  that future sales at or above current levels should be sufficient to allow us to continue as a viable business 
for the month period ended december   we generated  in positive cash flow  which excludes million raised from the issuance of preferred stock 
total net revenue of million for such period was essentially the same as for the same period last year 
if we fail to maintain or grow revenue levels we may have to raise additional financing to fund working capital needs 
if we fail to generate substantial incremental revenue  or we are not successful in raising additional financing on terms acceptable to us  we may not have sufficient working capital resources and our business may be materially adversely affected 
our new management structure could adversely impact its business 
in the second quarter of  our chief executive officer resigned  and in the third quarter  we hired a replacement chief executive officer 
in addition  in the first quarter of we have added two new members to our sales and marketing management team 
the effect of this new management structure on our business and employees is uncertain 
we cannot assure a liquid market for our stock 
in  we were informed by nasdaq that we were not in compliance with certain listing requirements for continued listing on their national market exchange 
we were able to take steps to meet the initial listing requirements of the nasdaq small cap market exchange 
as of september   we had slightly less than million in net stockholders equity  which is below the nasdaq s minimum requirement of million necessary to maintain our continued listing on the nasdaq small cap exchange 
on october   we completed a preferred stock offering and received  from the sale of  shares of series c preferred stock to s associates a company managed and controlled by segue s chairman  dr 
james simons  and dr 
howard morgan  one of our 
table of contents directors 
as a result of this transaction and the pro forma balance sheet that was filed with the sec on form k on october   nasdaq notified us that we were once again in compliance with the minimum requirement of million in net stockholders equity necessary to maintain our listing on the nasdaq small cap exchange 
on november   we completed an additional preferred stock offering and received  from the sale of  shares of series c preferred stock to a private investor  further raising our net stockholders equity position and strengthening our listing status on nasdaq s small cap market exchange 
however  continued compliance with the listing requirements of the nasdaq small cap market exchange  and thus a liquid market for our common stock  are closely related to our financial performance 
our future business may not be sufficient to assure continued listing on the nasdaq small cap market exchange 
we may have difficulty operating the business efficiently with fewer resources 
since  we have reduced headcount by approximately and implemented several cost reduction initiatives  including reduced marketing and sales expenses 
we were able to achieve increased productivity with fewer resources 
our ability to further increase our current productivity  as well as sustain current performance with fewer resources  is uncertain 
we face significant competition from other software companies 
the market for web based software quality management and testing and monitoring tools is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to intensify even further in the future 
we currently encounter competition from a number of public and private companies  including mercury interactive corporation  rational software corporation now part of ibm  compuware corporation and empirix 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed customer bases  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
therefore  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
an increase in competition could result in price reductions and loss of market share 
such competition and any resulting reduction in profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business could be adversely affected if our products contain errors 
software products as complex as ours may contain undetected errors or bugs which result in product failures 
the occurrence of errors could result in loss of or delay in revenue  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  significant repair and replacement costs  injury to our reputation  or damage to our efforts to build brand awareness  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we must hire and retain skilled personnel in a difficult economic environment 
qualified personnel remain in demand throughout the software industry 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly sales and marketing personnel  software engineers and other senior personnel 
the failure to attract and retain the highly skilled personnel that are integral to our direct sales  product development  service and support teams may limit the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements 
our ability to retain our qualified staff may be further impacted by our financial results during or in the future 
all of this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we face many risks associated with international business activities 
we derived approximately of total revenue from international customers in the month period ended december   as compared with in the same period last year 
the international market for software products is highly competitive and we expect to face substantial competition in this market from established and emerging companies 
we face many risks associated with international business activities including currency fluctuations  imposition of government controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability  tailoring of products to local requirements  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations 
in particular  currency 
table of contents fluctuations can have a significant impact on our foreign operating expenses 
continued growth of international sales is important to our growth and the stability 
to the extent we are unable to continue to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our success depends on our ability to protect our software and other proprietary technology 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
although we have taken steps to protect our proprietary technology  these efforts may be inadequate 
we currently rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights in our products 
currently  we have three issued patents and four are pending 
there can be no assurance that these patents would be upheld if challenged 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 
if we were to discover that any of our products violated third party proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms to continue licensing our software without substantial reengineering or that any effort to undertake such reengineering would be successful 
any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract management resources from our business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or result in an injunction 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
segue is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through its investing activities 
in addition  our ability to finance future transactions may be impacted if we are unable to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable rates 
our investing strategy to manage interest rate exposure is to invest in short term  highly secure and liquid investments 
we maintain a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents and short term investments primarily in high grade corporate commercial and government paper 
as of december   we had no short term investments  only cash and cash equivalents 
foreign currency risk 
segue faces exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or other financial instruments to hedge economic exposures or for trading 
historically  our primary currency exposures have been related to the operations of our foreign subsidiaries 
for the twelve month period ended december   we incurred a transaction and re measurement expense of approximately  compared to an expense of approximately  for the twelve month period ended december  as of december   the cumulative translation of foreign currency changes recorded in stockholders equity was
