item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we acquired warrior from arh warrior holdings  a subsidiary of alliance resource holdings  in february because the warrior acquisition was between entities under common control  it is accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to that used in a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the financial statements as of december  and  and for each of the two years in the period ended december   have been restated to reflect the combined historical results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the partnership and warrior 
arh warrior holdings acquired warrior on january  for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information  please see item financial statements and supplementary data 
note organization and presentation and note summary of significant accounting policies 
business we are a diversified producer and marketer of coal to major us utilities and industrial users 
in  our total production was million tons and our total sales were million tons 
the coal we produced in was approximately low sulfur coal  medium sulfur coal and high sulfur coal 
at december   we had approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in illinois  indiana  kentucky  maryland and west virginia 
we believe we control adequate reserves to implement our currently contemplated mining plans 
in addition  there are substantial unleased reserves on properties adjacent to some of our illinois basin region operations that we currently intend to acquire or lease as our mining operations approach these areas 
in  approximately of our sales tonnage was consumed by electric utilities with the balance consumed by cogeneration plants and industrial users 
our largest customers in were seminole  sso  and vepco 
in  approximately of our sales tonnage  including approximately of our medium and high sulfur coal sales tonnage  was sold under long term contracts 
the balance of our sales were made in the spot market 
our long term contracts contribute to our stability and profitability by providing greater predictability of sales volumes and sales prices 
in  approximately of our medium and high sulfur coal was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices  also known as scrubbers  to remove sulfur dioxide 
we have entered into long term agreements with sso to host and operate its coal synfuel production facility currently located at warrior  supply the facility with coal feedstock  assist sso with the marketing of coal synfuel and provide it with other services 
these agreements expire on december  and provide us with coal sales and rental and service fees from sso based on the synfuel facility throughput tonnages 
these amounts are dependent on the ability of sso s members to use certain qualifying tax credits applicable to the facility 
the term of each of these agreements is subject to early cancellation provisions customary for transactions of these types  including the unavailability of coal synfuel tax credits  the termination of associated coal synfuel sales contracts  and the occurrence of certain force majeure events 
we have maintained back up coal supply agreements with each coal synfuel customer that automatically provide for sale of our coal to these customers in the event they do not purchase coal synfuel from sso 
in conjunction with a decision to relocate the coal synfuel production facility from hopkins to warrior  agreements for providing certain of these services were assigned to alliance service  a wholly owned subsidiary of alliance coal  in december alliance service is subject to federal and state income taxes 
for  the incremental annual net income benefit from the combination of the various coal synfuel related agreements was approximately million  assuming that coal pricing would not have increased without the availability of synfuel 
the continuation of the incremental net income benefit associated with sso s coal synfuel facility cannot be assured 
we earn income by supplying sso s synfuel facility with coal feedstock  assisting sso with the marketing of coal synfuel  and providing rental and other services 
pursuant to our agreement with sso  we are not obligated to make retroactive adjustments or reimbursements if sso s tax credits are disallowed 
in june the irs suspended the issuance of private letter rulings on the significant chemical change requirement to qualify for synfuel tax credits and announced that it was reviewing the test procedures and results used by taxpayers to establish that a significant chemical change had occurred 
in october  the irs completed its review and concluded that the test procedures and results were scientifically valid if applied in a consistent and unbiased manner 
the irs has resumed issuing private letter rulings under its existing guidelines 
sso has advised us that its private letter ruling could be reviewed by the irs as part of a tax audit  similar to the irs reviews of other synfuel procedures 
sso has also advised us that the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the senate committee on governmental affairs subcommittee is reviewing the synfuel industry  that the subcommittee has indicated that they hope to interview almost all taxpayers that are involved in the synfuel business  and that sso has been requested to meet informally with the subcommittee to help enhance the subcommittee s knowledge of the synfuel industry 
one of our business strategies is to continue to make productivity improvements to remain a low cost producer in each region in which we operate 
our principal expenses related to the production of coal are labor and benefits  equipment  materials and supplies  maintenance  royalties and excise taxes 
unlike most of our competitors in the eastern us  we employ a totally union free workforce 
many of the benefits of the union free workforce are not necessarily reflected in direct costs  but we believe are related to higher productivity 
in addition  while we do not pay our customers transportation costs  they may be substantial and often the determining factor in a coal consumer s contracting decision 
our mining operations are located near many of the major eastern utility generating plants and on major coal hauling railroads in the eastern us summary in  we reported record net income of million  an increase of over net income of million 
we grew through a combination of internal expansion and an acquisition 
we added continuous miner units at gibson  warrior and mc mining and completed infrastructure investments such as new mine shafts at dotiki and mc mining and a new slope at warrior 
we acquired warrior in february tons produced increased to million tons 
tons sold increased to million tons 
the combination of adding mining units  realizing benefits from completed infrastructure projects and the absence of adverse geologic conditions encountered at mettiki in the third quarter of contributed to lower operating expenses per ton sold 
the lower operating expenses per ton sold was the primary factor in achieving record net income  offsetting the impact of lower sales prices 
for  we have commitments for substantially all of our production 
for our estimated production  approximately is committed under existing coal sales agreements and approximately is subject to market price negotiations 
in  we will continue our efforts to maximize the cost reduction opportunities created by our increased production capacity 
dotiki plans to increase the number of operating sections that operate with two continuous miners and expand the throughput capacity of its preparation plant approximately 
with the infrastructure created by the capital investments we have made over the past three years  we could  with some additional capital investments  increase production approximately two million tons to respond to increases in market place demand 
on february   the dotiki mine was temporarily idled following the occurrence of a mine fire 
we have successfully extinguished the fire and have totally isolated the affected area of the mine behind permanent seals 
production resumed on march  at this time  we are unable to quantify the financial impact of the fire or to predict when dotiki will return to normal production 
the temporary idling of dotiki will reduce earnings for the first quarter of we have commercial property insurance including business interruption coverage that we currently believe should cover a substantial portion of the financial loss 
assuming that is correct  dotiki s losses recognized in the first quarter of should be substantially offset by an insurance settlement that would be recognized later in the year 
there can be no assurance of the amount or timing of recovery  however  until the claim is resolved with the insurance underwriter 
our insurance program provides for a deductible of million and a ten percent coinsurance 
in addition to the losses associated with business interruption  we have currently identified approximately million of out of pocket expenses that generally fall into the category of extra expenses  expedited expenses and other areas of coverage under the commercial property insurance policy 
we expect that additional out of pocket costs will be identified in the future

results of operations compared with per ton sold in thousands tons sold   n a n a tons produced   n a n a coal sales   operating expenses and outside purchases   operating expenses 
operating expenses were comparable for and at million and million  respectively 
increased operating expenses associated with higher production and sales levels at our active mines were offset by a decrease associated with idling the hopkins complex on june  operating expenses declined on a cost per ton sold basis as production increased at all of our active operations except pattiki 
pattiki s production was essentially the same in and increased production reflects the absence of the adverse geologic conditions encountered at mettiki in the third quarter of and the emerging benefit of several strategic capital investments made during the past two years 
we have added continuous miner units at gibson  warrior and mc mining and have made infrastructure investments  such as new mine shafts  at dotiki  warrior and mc mining 
additionally  operating expenses decreased due to the reversal of an expense accrual of million established in the expense accrual was established in conjunction with the idling of pontiki in that created an expectation of a probable increase in workers compensation costs associated with the terminated workforce 
the anticipated increase in workers compensation claims did not emerge and  with limited exceptions  the statute of limitations expired in december for the filing or reopening of workers compensation claims associated with the employee terminations 
coal sales 
coal sales for increased to million from million for the increase of million was attributable to increased tons sold partially offset by lower sales prices 
sales prices in benefited from coal sales agreements entered into during the second half of when sales prices for deliveries in increased in response to a combination of factors including low coal stockpiles and supply shortages 
tons sold increased to million for from million in  reflecting an increase in tons produced 
tons produced increased to million for from million in please see operating expenses above concerning the increase in tons produced 
other sales and operating revenues 
other sales and operating revenues  which is primarily comprised of services to the coal synfuel production facility  increased to million from million in however  the million increase was primarily attributable to providing additional services for treating  handling and transporting coal unrelated to the coal synfuel services 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for increased to million compared to million for the million increase was primarily attributable to higher expense accruals of million associated with incentive compensation programs  and the remaining increase in expense reflects various other increases in administrative compliance costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization were comparable for and at million and million  respectively 
additional depreciation associated with the capital additions described in operating expenses above was offset by lower depreciation of million at the idled hopkins complex 
please see item business  mining operations  illinois basin operations 
interest expense 
interest expense for declined to million from million in primarily attributable to decreased borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
outside purchases 
outside purchases for decreased to million from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in coal purchases from a third party producer that ceased production in the fourth quarter of transportation revenues and expenses 
transportation revenues and expenses for increased to million from million for the increase of million was primarily attributable to the increase in tons sold 
we reflect reimbursement of the cost of transporting coal to customers through third party carriers as transportation revenues and the corresponding expense as transportation expense in the consolidated statements of income 
no margin is realized on transportation revenues 
income before income tax expense benefit and cumulative effect of accounting change 
income before income tax expense benefit and cumulative effect of accounting change increased to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to lower cost per ton sold operating costs and higher sales volumes  partially offset by lower sales prices and increased general and administrative expenses 
income tax expense benefit

in conjunction with a decision to relocate the coal synfuel facility  agreements for a portion of the services provided to the coal synfuel producer were assigned to alliance service in december approximately million of the increase in income tax expense was associated with coal synfuel related services performed by alliance service 
the balance of the income tax expense increase was attributable to warrior  which had a net income tax benefit for the year of approximately million 
since our acquisition of warrior on february   the financial results of warrior are no longer subject to federal or state income taxes 
compared with we acquired warrior from arh warrior holdings  a subsidiary of alliance resource holdings  in february because the warrior acquisition was between entities under common control  it is accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to that used in a pooling of interests

coal sales for increased to million from million for the increase of million was primarily attributable to higher price sales contracts secured during the second half of for deliveries in and higher productivity and coal sales from gibson 
the higher priced sales contracts reflected a combination of factors including low coal stockpiles and supply shortages 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the domestic coal brokerage market 
tons sold were comparable for and at million tons and million tons  respectively 
tons produced increased to million for compared to million in  primarily reflecting increased production at gibson

please see discussion above under workers compensation and pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
ongoing acquisition activities consistent with our business strategy  from time to time we engage in discussions with potential sellers regarding possible acquisitions by us 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we generally satisfy our working capital requirements and fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations from cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that the cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major capital improvements or acquisitions  scheduled debt payments and distribution payments 
to further develop available financing alternatives  in october  we entered into a master lease agreement 
under the master lease agreement  lease terms and rental payments are negotiated individually when specific pieces of equipment are leased 
during  we had rental expense of million under the master lease agreement 
we had no equipment leased under the master equipment lease at december  our credit facility limits the amount of total operating lease obligations to million payable in any period of consecutive months 
our ability to satisfy our obligations and planned expenditures will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal industry  some of which are beyond our control 
cash flows cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was principally attributable to increased operating income 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in the increased use of cash is principally attributable to purchasing of marketable securities of million in compared to the receipt of proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities in net cash used in financing activities was million for  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the decrease is primarily attributable to the proceeds received from our common unit offering during of million partially offset by an increase of million in distributions to our partners due to an increase in the quarterly distribution rate of per unit to per unit and the additional common units outstanding from the common unit offering  payment of warrior s borrowings of million under a revolving credit agreement and an increase in payments of million on long term debt 
the quarterly distribution rate was increased to per unit for the quarter ended december  we expect to maintain this level of quarterly cash distribution during we have various commitments primarily related to long term debt  operating lease commitments related to buildings and equipment  obligations for estimated reclamation and mining closing costs  capital project commitments  and pension funding 
we expect to fund these commitments with cash generated from operations  proceeds from marketable securities  and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the following table provides details regarding our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands less contractual than after obligations total year years years years long term debt     operating leases      other long term obligations excluding discount effect of million for reclamation liability      capital projects   we expect to contribute million to the defined benefit pension plan pension plan during we estimate that our combined interest and income tax cash requirements will be approximately million and million  respectively in capital expenditures capital expenditures decreased to million in  compared to million in the capital expenditures in of million included million for the warrior acquisition 
excluding the warrior acquisition  capital expenditures for decreased million compared to capital expenditures for the period 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the substantial completion of the extension into an adjacent reserve area at pattiki in late  new infrastructure projects at warrior in  and the new service shaft at dotiki completed in april the majority of the capital expenditures associated with the pattiki  warrior and dotiki projects were incurred during in february  we acquired warrior from an affiliate  arh warrior holdings  pursuant to the terms of a previously existing agreement 
warrior owns an underground mining complex located between and adjacent to our other western kentucky operations near madisonville  kentucky 
we paid million to arh warrior holdings in accordance with the terms of an amended and restated put and call option agreement 
in addition  we repaid warrior s borrowings of million under the revolving credit agreement between our special general partner and warrior 
we funded the warrior acquisition through a portion of the proceeds received from the issuance of  common units in february we currently project that our average annual maintenance capital expenditures will be approximately million 
we also currently expect to fund our anticipated total capital expenditures for of million  with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility described below 
notes offering and credit facility concurrently with the closing of our initial public offering  our special general partner issued  and our intermediate partnership assumed the obligations with respect to  million principal amount of senior notes due august  senior notes 
on august   our intermediate partnership completed a new million revolving credit facility credit facility  which expires september  the credit facility replaced a million credit facility that would have expired august we paid in full all amounts outstanding under the original credit facility with borrowings of million under the credit facility 
the interest rate on the credit facility is based on either the i london interbank offered rate or ii the base rate  which is equal to the greater of the jpmorgan chase prime rate or the federal funds rate plus of  plus  in either case  an applicable margin 
we incurred certain costs aggregating million associated with the credit facility 
these costs have been deferred and are being amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the credit facility 
we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  letters of credit can be issued under the credit facility not to exceed million 
outstanding letters of credit reduce amounts available under the credit facility 
at december   we had letters of credit of million outstanding under the credit facility 
the senior notes and credit facility are guaranteed by all of the subsidiaries of our intermediate partnership 
the senior notes and credit facility contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants  including the amount of distributions by our intermediate partnership and the incurrence of other debt 
we were in compliance with the covenants of both the credit facility and senior notes at december  we have previously entered into and have maintained agreements with two banks to provide additional letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million to maintain surety bonds to secure our obligations for reclamation liabilities and workers compensation benefits 
at december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding under these agreements 
our special general partner guarantees the letters of credit 
critical accounting policies from our summary of significant accounting policies  we have identified the following accounting policies that require the exercise of our most difficult  complex and subjective levels of judgment 
our judgments in the following areas are principally based on estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
please see item financial statements and supplementary data 
actual results that are influenced by future events could materially differ from the current estimates 
long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
the amount of an impairment is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset  which is based on cash flows from that asset  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
events or changes in circumstance that could cause us to perform such a review include  but are not limited to  the loss of a major coal supply agreement  a significant decline in demand for our coal and an adverse change in geologic conditions 
reclamation and mine closing costs the federal smcra and similar state statutes require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
we record the liability for the estimated cost of future mine reclamation and closing procedures on a present value basis when incurred  and the associated cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
those costs relate to sealing portals at underground mines and to reclaiming the final pit and support acreage at surface mines 
other costs common to both types of mining are related to removing or covering refuse piles and settling ponds  and dismantling preparation plants  other facilities and roadway infrastructure 
we had accrued liabilities of million for these costs at december  and  respectively 
workers compensation and pneumoconiosis black lung benefits we provide income replacement and medical treatment for work related traumatic injury claims as required by applicable state laws 
we provide for these claims through self insurance programs 
the liability for traumatic injury claims is the estimated present value of current workers compensation benefits  based on an annual independent actuarial study 
the actuarial calculations are based on a blend of actuarial projection methods and numerous assumptions including development patterns  mortality  medical costs and interest rates 
we had accrued liabilities of million and million for these costs at december  and  respectively 
a one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the liability at december  approximately million  which would have a corresponding increase in operating expenses 
coal mining companies are subject to the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  and various state statues for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients related to coal worker s pneumoconiosis black lung 
we provide for these claims through self insurance programs 
our estimated black lung liability is based on an annual actuarial study performed by an independent actuary 
the actuarial calculations are based on numerous assumptions including disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and interest rates 
we had accrued liabilities of million and million for these benefits at december  and  respectively 
a one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the expense recognized for the year ended december  by approximately million 
under the service cost method used to estimate our black lung benefits liability  actuarial gains or losses attributable to changes in actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate are amortized over the remaining service period of active miners 
effective january   we changed our method of estimating black lung benefits to the service cost method described in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  which method is permitted under sfas no 
employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
in january  governmental regulations regarding the federal black lung benefits claims approval process became effective 
these new regulations specifically define the black lung disability as progressive and also expand the definition of pneumoconiosis to mandate consideration of diseases that are caused by factors other than exposure to coal dust 
we believe the change to the sfas no 
measurement methodology better matches black lung costs over the service lives of the miners who ultimately receive the black lung benefits and is more reflective of the enacted regulations  which place significant emphasis on coal miners future years of employment in the coal industry 
we previously accrued the black lung benefits liability at the present value of the actuarially determined current and future estimated black lung benefit payments utilizing the methodology prescribed under sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which was also permitted by sfas no 
universal shelf in april  we filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement allowing us to issue from time to time up to an aggregate of million of debt or equity securities 
at march   we had approximately million available under this registration statement 
related party transactions administrative services our partnership agreement provides that our managing general partner and its affiliates be reimbursed for all direct and indirect expenses they incur or payments they make on our behalf including  but not limited to  management s salaries and related benefits including incentive compensation  and accounting  budget  planning  treasury  public relations  land administration  environmental  permitting  payroll  benefits  disability  workers compensation management  legal and information technology services 
our managing general partner may determine in its sole discretion the expenses that are allocable to us 
total costs billed by our managing general partner and its affiliates to us were approximately   and  for the years ended december    and respectively 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to higher accruals related to common unit based incentive programs  which were impacted by the increased market value of our common units  and the short term incentive plan stip 
warrior acquisition on february   we acquired warrior from an affiliate  arh warrior holdings a subsidiary of alliance resource holdings  pursuant to an amended and restated put and call option agreement put call agreement 
warrior purchased the capital stock of roberts bros 
coal co  inc  warrior coal mining company  warrior coal corporation and certain assets of christian coal corp 
and richland mining co  inc in january our managing general partner had previously declined the opportunity to purchase these assets as we had previously committed to major capital expenditures at two existing operations 
as a condition to not exercising its right of first refusal  we requested that arh warrior holdings enter into a put and call arrangement for warrior 
we and arh warrior holdings  with the approval of the conflicts committee of our managing general partner  entered into the put call agreement in january concurrently  arh warrior holdings acquired warrior in january for million 
the put call agreement preserved the opportunity for us to acquire warrior during a specified time period 
under the terms of the put call agreement  arh warrior holdings exercised its put option requiring us to purchase warrior at a put option price of approximately million 
the option provisions of the put call agreement were subject to certain conditions unless otherwise waived  including  among others  a the non occurrence of a material adverse change in the business and financial condition of warrior  b the prohibition of any dividends or other distributions to warrior s shareholders  c the maintenance of warrior s assets in good working condition  d the prohibition on the sale of any equity interest in warrior except for the options contained in the put call agreement  and e the prohibition on the sale or transfer of warrior s assets except those made in the ordinary course of its business 
the put call agreement option prices reflected negotiated sale and purchase amounts that both parties determined would allow each party to satisfy acceptable minimum investment returns in the event either the put or call options were exercised 
in january and in december  we developed financial projections for warrior based on due diligence procedures we customarily perform when considering the acquisition of a coal mine 
the assumptions underlying the financial projections made by us for warrior included  among others  a annual production levels ranging from million to million tons  b coal prices at or below the then current coal prices and c a discount rate of percent 
based on these financial projections  as of the date of the acquisition and at december  and  we believe that the fair value of warrior was equal to or greater than the put option exercise price 
the put option price of million was paid to arh warrior holdings in accordance with the terms of the put call agreement 
in addition  we repaid warrior s borrowings of million under the revolving credit agreement between our special general partner and warrior 
the primary borrowings under the revolving credit agreement financed new infrastructure capital projects at warrior that have contributed to improved productivity and significantly increased capacity 
we funded the warrior acquisition through a portion of the proceeds received from the issuance of  common units 
because the warrior acquisition was between entities under common control  it has been accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to that used in a pooling of interests 
under the terms of the put call agreement  we assumed certain other obligations  including a mineral lease and sublease with sgp land  a subsidiary of our special general partner  covering coal reserves that have been and will continue to be mined by warrior 
the terms and conditions of the mineral lease and sub lease remain unchanged 
sgp land dotiki has a mineral lease and sublease with sgp land requiring annual minimum royalty payments of million  payable in advance through or until million of cumulative annual minimum and or earned royalty payments have been paid 
dotiki paid royalties of  for and million in and dotiki has recouped as earned royalties all advance minimum royalty payments made under these lease terms as of december  warrior has a mineral lease and sublease with sgp land 
under the terms of the lease  warrior has paid and will continue to pay in arrears an annual minimum royalty obligation of  until  of cumulative annual minimum and or earned royalty payments have been paid 
the annual minimum royalty periods are from october st through the end of the following september  expiring september  warrior paid royalties of   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
warrior has recouped as earned royalties all advance minimum royalty payments made in accordance with these lease terms except for  as of december  under the terms of the mineral lease and sublease agreements described above  dotiki and warrior also reimbursed sgp land for sgp land s base lease obligations 
we reimbursed sgp land   and  for the years ended december   and respectively  for the base lease obligations 
dotiki and warrior have recouped as earned royalties all advance minimum royalty payments made in accordance with these terms except for  as of december  in  sgp land  as successor in interest to an unaffiliated third party  entered into an amended mineral lease with mc mining 
under the terms of the lease  mc mining has paid and will continue to pay an annual minimum royalty obligation of  until million of cumulative annual minimum and or earned royalty payments have been paid 
mc mining paid royalties of   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
mc mining has recouped as earned royalties all advance minimum royalty payments made under these lease terms as of december  we also have an option to lease and or sublease certain reserves from sgp land  which reserves are contiguous to hopkins 
under the terms of the option to lease and sublease  we paid option fees of  during the years ended december  and the option fee of  was paid in january and is included in the due to affiliates balance as of december  the anticipated annual minimum royalty obligation is  payable in advance through special general partner effective january  gibson entered into a noncancelable operating lease arrangement with our special general partner for its coal preparation plant and ancillary facilities 
based on the terms of the lease  gibson has paid and will continue to make monthly payments of approximately  through january lease expense was  for  and we have previously entered into and have maintained agreements with two banks to provide letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million to maintain surety bonds to secure our obligations for reclamation liabilities and workers compensation benefits 
at december   we had million in outstanding letters of credit 
our special general partner guarantees these letters of credit 
historically  we have compensated our special general partner a guarantee fee equal to per annum of the face amount of the letters of credit outstanding 
our special general partner agreed to waive the guarantee fee in exchange for a parent guarantee from our intermediate partnership and alliance coal on the mineral lease and sublease with dotiki and warrior 
we paid approximately   and  in guarantee fees to our special general partner for the years ended december    and  respectively 
accruals of other liabilities we had accruals for other liabilities  including current obligations  totaling million and million at december  and these accruals were chiefly comprised of workers compensation benefits  black lung benefits  and costs associated with reclamation and mine closings 
these obligations are self insured 
the accruals of these items were based on estimates of future expenditures based on current legislation  related regulations and other developments 
thus  from time to time  our results of operations may be significantly affected by changes to these liabilities 
please see item financial statements and supplementary data 
note reclamation and mine closing costs and note pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
pension plan we maintain a pension plan  which covers certain employees at the mining operations 
our pension expense was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the pension expense is based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of returns on our pension plan assets of and and a discount rates of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
additionally  we base our determination of pension expense on an unsmoothed market related valuation of assets equal to the fair value of assets  which immediately recognizes all investment gains or losses 
in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our investment manager  including their review of asset class return expectations by economists  and our actuary 
at january   our expected long term return assumption is at least 
our advisors base the projected returns on broad equity and bond indices 
our expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of with equity managers  with an expected long term rate of return of  and with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of 
the pension plan trustee regularly reviews our actual asset allocation in accordance with our investment guidelines and periodically rebalanced our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the investment committee reviews our asset allocation with the compensation committee annually 
the discount rate that we utilize for determining our future pension obligation is based on a review of currently available high quality fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
we have historically used the average monthly yield for december of an aa rated utility bond index as the primary benchmark for establishing the discount rate 
the duration of the bonds that comprise this index is comparable to the duration of the benefit obligation in the pension plan 
the discount rate determined on this basis decreased from at december  to at december  we estimate that our pension plan expense and cash contributions will be approximately  and  respectively in future actual pension expense and contributions will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employees participating in the pension plan 
lowering the expected long term rate of return assumption by from to at december  would have increased our pension expense for the year ended december  by approximately  lowering the discount rate assumption by from to at december  would have increased our pension expense for the year ended december  by approximately  inflation inflation in the us has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the three years in the period ended december  recent accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  a cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value for each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
to settle the liability  the obligations for its recorded amount is paid or a gain or loss upon settlement is incurred 
since we have historically adhered to accounting principles similar to sfas no 
 this standard had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
recent accounting issue extractive industry companies have historically classified leased coal interests and advance royalties as tangible assets  which is consistent with the classification of owned coal due to the similar rights of the leaseholder 
sfas no 
 business combinations  identifies mineral rights as an example of a contract based intangible asset that should be considered for separate classification as the result of a business combination 
due to the potential for inconsistencies in applying the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in the extractive industries as they relate to mineral interests controlled by other than fee ownership  the emerging issues task force eitf has established a mining industry working group that is currently addressing this issue 
depending on the conclusions reached by the mining industry working group and the eitf  the classification of our leased coal interests and advance royalties in our consolidated balance sheets may be revised 
risk factors if any of the following risks were actually to occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common units could decline 
risks inherent in our business a substantial or extended decline in coal prices could negatively impact our results of operations 
several of our customers have had their credit rating down graded  and two customers have filed for bankruptcy 
while we have not received notice of  and otherwise are not aware of  the intent of any of these customers to default on their contractual obligations to us  the lowered credit ratings and the bankruptcy filing of these customers indicate that this is a possibility 
several coal companies that compete with us have filed for bankruptcy protection 
if they emerge from bankruptcy with their debt burden reduced or eliminated  those companies may possess a significant competitive advantage over us 
a material portion of our net income and cash flow is dependent on the continued ability by us or others to realize benefits from state and federal tax credits 
if the benefit to us from any of these tax credits is materially reduced  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations and might impair our ability to pay the distributions on our units 
competition within the coal industry may adversely affect our ability to sell coal  and excess production capacity in the industry could put downward pressure on coal prices 
newly constructed power plants may be fueled by natural gas 
any change in consumption patterns by utilities  away from the use of coal  could affect our ability to sell the coal we produce 
from time to time conditions in the coal industry may make it more difficult for us to extend existing or enter into new long term contracts 
this could affect the stability and profitability of our operations 
some of our long term contracts contain provisions allowing for the renegotiation of prices and  in some instances  the termination of the contract or the suspension of purchases by customers 
some of our long term contracts require us to supply all of our customers coal needs 
if these customers coal requirements decline  our revenues under these contracts will also drop 
a substantial portion of our coal has a high sulfur content 
this coal may become more difficult to sell because the clean air act may impact the ability of electric utilities to burn high sulfur coal through the regulation of emissions 
we depend on a few customers for a significant portion of our revenues  and the loss of one or more significant customers could impact our ability to sell the coal we produce 
litigation relating to disputes with our customers may result in substantial costs  liabilities and loss of revenues 
the term of each of the agreements associated with the coal synfuel facility at warrior is subject to early cancellation provisions customary for transactions of these types  including the unavailability of synfuel tax credits  the termination of associated coal synfuel sales contracts  and the occurrence of certain force majeure events 
therefore  the continuation of the operating revenues associated with the coal synfuel production facility cannot be assured 
coal mining is subject to inherent risks that are beyond our control and these risks may not be fully covered under our insurance policies 
these risks include fires and explosions from methane  natural disasters like floods  mining and processing equipment failures  changes or variations in geologic conditions  inability to acquire mining rights or permits  employee injuries or fatalities  and labor related interruptions 
although none of our employees are members of unions  our work force may not remain union free in the future 
any significant increase in transportation costs or disruption of the transportation of our coal may impair our ability to sell coal 
we may not be able to grow successfully through future acquisitions  and we may not be able to effectively integrate the various businesses or properties we do acquire 
our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to replace our coal reserves 
the estimates of our reserves may prove inaccurate  and unitholders should not place undue reliance on these estimates 
cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance 
in addition  our managing general partner s discretion in establishing cash reserves may negatively impact a unitholder s receipt of cash distributions 
our indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds  make distributions to unitholders or capitalize on business opportunities 
risks inherent in an investment in the partnership the president and chief executive officer of our managing general partner effectively controls us through his ownership of a majority of the equity interests in our managing general partner and affiliates 
unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our managing general partner 
we may issue additional common units without the approval of common unitholders  which would dilute existing unitholders interests 
the issuance of additional common units  including upon conversion of subordinated units  will increase the risk that we will be unable to pay the full minimum quarterly distribution on all common units 
cost reimbursements to our general partners may be substantial and will reduce our cash available for distribution 
our managing general partner has a limited call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price 
unitholders may not have limited liability under some circumstances 
our general partners and their affiliates  which are controlled by our management  may in some instances engage in activities that compete directly with us 
regulatory risks we are subject to federal  state and local regulations on health  safety  environmental and numerous other matters 
these regulations increase our costs of doing business  or discourage customers from buying our coal 
we have black lung benefits and workers compensation obligations that could increase if new legislation is enacted 
the clean air act affects our customers and could significantly influence their purchasing decisions 
new regulations under the clean air act could also reduce demand for our coal 
the passage of state and federal legislation responsive to concerns over emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide could result in a reduced use of coal by electric power generators 
any such reduction in use could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we are subject to the clean water act which imposes limitations  and monitoring and reporting obligations  on our discharge of pollutants into water 
those limitations and obligations may become more stringent and result in restricted operations and increased costs 
we are subject to the safe drinking water act  which imposes various requirements on us through coal refuse disposal under the underground injection control program or regulation of our public drinking water systems 
we are subject to reclamation  mine closure and real property restoration regulatory obligations and must accrue for the estimated cost of complying with these regulations 
we could incur significant costs under federal and state superfund and waste management statutes 
tax risks to common unitholders our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to entity level taxation by states 
if the irs treats us as a corporation or we become subject to entity level taxation for state tax purposes  it would substantially reduce distributions to our unitholders and our ability to make payments on our debt securities 
we have not requested an irs ruling with respect to our tax treatment 
you may be required to pay taxes on income from us even if you receive no cash distributions 
tax gain or loss on disposition of common units could be different than expected 
common unitholders  other than individuals who are us residents  may experience adverse tax consequences from owning common units 
we have registered with the irs as a tax shelter 
this may increase the risk of an irs audit of us or a common unitholder 
we treat a purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits as the seller 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of common units 
common unitholders will likely be subject to state and local taxes as a result of an investment in common units 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have significant long term coal supply agreements 
virtually all of the long term coal supply agreements are subject to price adjustment provisions  which permit an increase or decrease periodically in the contract price to principally reflect changes in specified price indices or items such as taxes  royalties or actual production costs 
for additional discussion of coal supply agreements  please see item business 
coal marketing and sales and item financial statements and supplementary data 
note concentration of credit risk and major customers 
almost all of our predecessor s transactions were  and all of our transactions are  denominated in us dollars  and as a result  we do not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks 
at the current time  we do not have any interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price hedging transactions outstanding 
on august   our intermediate partnership completed a million revolving credit facility which replaces a million credit facility 
borrowings under the new revolving credit facility and the previous credit facility are and were at variable rates and  as a result  we have interest rate exposure 
our earnings are not materially affected by changes in interest rates 
if interest rates would have increased by basis points  interest expense for the year ended december  would have increased by approximately  we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
the fair values of long term debt are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses  based upon our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of december   and the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments are as follows in thousands fair value expected maturity dates december  as of december  thereafter total senior notes fixed rate        weighted average interest rate fair value expected maturity dates december  as of december  thereafter total senior notes fixed rate       weighted average interest rate term loan floating rate     weighted average interest rate
