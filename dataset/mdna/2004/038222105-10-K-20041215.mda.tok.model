item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied s business and results of operations 
this md a should be read in conjunction with applied s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
md a consists of the following sections overview a summary of applied s business  measurements and opportunities 
results of operations a discussion of operating results 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources an analysis of cash flows  sources and uses of cash  contractual obligations and financial position 
critical accounting policies a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates 
trends  risks and uncertainties a discussion of significant risks that could affect applied s operating results 
overview applied develops  manufactures  markets and services integrated circuit fabrication equipment for the worldwide semiconductor industry 
product development and manufacturing activities occur in north america  the united kingdom and israel 
applied s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and  as a result  are sold through a direct sales force 
customer demand for spare parts and services is fulfilled through a global spare parts distribution system and trained service engineers located around the world in close proximity to customer sites 
as a supplier to the global semiconductor industry  applied s results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for integrated circuits  which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products 
the global semiconductor industry is volatile 
the downturn that began in fiscal and continued into fiscal constituted what management believes to be the longest and most severe downturn experienced by the semiconductor equipment industry 
a recovery began in the fourth fiscal quarter of and continued throughout fiscal applied s results in fiscal through reflect this volatility 
the following table presents certain significant measurements of the past three fiscal years fiscal year in millions  except per share amounts and percentages new orders net sales gross margin gross margin percent net income loss earnings loss per share during fiscal and  lower sales volume and under absorption of manufacturing and field service costs resulted in lower gross margins 
in response to the difficult economic environment that began in fiscal  applied implemented a series of actions that were intended to better align applied s cost structure with anticipated business conditions 
during fiscal  when business conditions did not improve significantly  
table of contents applied implemented a realignment plan  which concluded in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal and operating results were negatively affected by lower net sales  reduced gross margins and charges related to realignment activities 
operating results for fiscal reflected a recovery in the semiconductor industry and the global economy  as well as applied s realized savings from completed realignment activities 
in addition  applied gained market share in critical areas  including mm equipment and copper interconnect  improved operational efficiencies  and increased its strong cash position 
applied s long term opportunities depend in part on successful execution of a growth strategy  including increasing market share in existing markets  expanding into related markets  and cultivating new markets and business models 
these opportunities are also subject to global economic conditions  advanced technology and or capacity requirements of semiconductor manufacturers and their capital investment trends  the profitability of semiconductor manufacturers  supply and demand for semiconductors  continued investment in rd e and relative competitiveness of applied s equipment and service products 
for this and other reasons set forth in the section entitled trends  risks and uncertainties  applied s prior results of operations may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
results of operations applied s fiscal year ends on the last sunday in october of each year 
fiscal contained weeks  whereas fiscal and each contained weeks 
the first fiscal quarter of contained weeks  whereas the first fiscal quarter of and each contained weeks 
net sales applied s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal  and as a result of these conditions  there were significant fluctuations in applied s quarterly new orders and net sales  both within and across fiscal years 
demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in semiconductor supply and demand and other factors  including rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 
quarterly and full fiscal year financial information follows fiscal quarter fiscal first second third fourth year in millions  except per share amounts new orders net sales gross margin net income loss earnings loss per share new orders net sales gross margin net income loss earnings loss per share new orders net sales gross margin net income earnings per share 
table of contents net sales by geographic region  which were attributed to the location of the customers facilities  were as follows fiscal year in millions taiwan asia pacific japan north america korea europe includes china 
primarily the united states 
during fiscal year  slowing worldwide demand for semiconductors resulted in a rapid decline in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
inventory buildups in telecommunication products  slower than expected personal computer sales and slower global economic growth caused semiconductor companies to reduce their capital spending and reschedule or cancel existing orders 
this decline in demand deepened sequentially throughout fiscal into a severe industry downturn due to continued weakness in the macro economic climate and reduced consumption of electronic products  which resulted in further capital spending cutbacks by applied s customers 
this industry downturn extended from through the third fiscal quarter of beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of and continuing into fiscal  customers made increased investments in capital equipment for capacity and technology  responding to higher spending for consumer electronics and business information technology and an increase in semiconductor demand 
applied experienced a decline in demand for its products in the first fiscal quarter of in the second fiscal quarter of  customers ordered equipment for mm advanced capacity to satisfy demand driven by consumer related and wireless devices 
customers also continued to place technology orders to invest in mm wafer processing  copper and smaller line width technologies 
however  second quarter demand levels proved to be unsustainable as the global economic environment weakened through the middle of the year  and customers reduced their level of capacity spending accordingly  while maintaining advanced technology spending 
net sales peaked in the third fiscal quarter of and flattened in the fourth fiscal quarter of included in fiscal net sales was the remaining million of revenue that was recognized as part of the cumulative effect of implementing sab net sales declined percent from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal new orders declined from billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of to billion for each of the first and second fiscal quarters of  reflecting the continued and prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry 
however  new orders increased to billion for the third fiscal quarter and billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of  reflecting customers continued investments in dram and logic and their transition to mm  along with the increased capacity utilization in both advanced and established technologies 
following these new order trends  net sales decreased to approximately billion for each of the first three fiscal quarters of  reflecting the impact of the prolonged industry downturn 
net sales increased to billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of  indicating the beginning of an industry recovery 
net sales increased percent from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal orders increased from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal  reflecting a broad based increase in capital investment by both dram and logic manufacturers for mm technology to meet rising demand for semiconductors 
following the new order trends  net sales increased to approximately billion for fiscal  reflecting the fulfillment of higher levels of orders for capital equipment received in prior quarters to support customers manufacturing capacity expansion and new technology requirements 

table of contents realignment activities during fiscal  in response to the continuing difficult business conditions  applied implemented a series of activities to better align applied s cost structure with prevailing economic conditions 
realignment activities consisted of consolidation of facilities  reductions in workforce  and refocused product efforts  such as the electron beam mask pattern product line and implementation of the global spare parts distribution system which included the closure of a central warehouse 
as a result of the realignment activities  applied vacated approximately two million square feet and reduced approximately  positions during realignment activities resulted in charges across multiple categories  as incurred  including cost of products sold  research  development and engineering rd e expenses  and restructuring and asset impairment charges 
during the first fiscal quarter of  realignment activities were completed and reported as restructuring  asset impairments and other charges as discussed below 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased from percent for fiscal to percent for fiscal  and then increased to percent for fiscal in fiscal  applied experienced unprecedented new order and revenue growth 
accordingly  applied expanded its manufacturing facilities to accommodate anticipated growth 
the decreased business volume in fiscal  and  due to the industry downturn  was insufficient to fully absorb the overhead costs of these facilities  resulting in lower gross margins for all respective periods 
the continued decline in gross margin for fiscal was principally attributable to under absorption of manufacturing and field service costs as a result of prolonged lower business volumes  and inventory writeoffs and charges associated with refocused product efforts  including an electron beam mask pattern product and implementation of the global spare parts distribution system 
the increase in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was principally attributable to improved revenue levels  changes in product mix  decreased product costs  and increased manufacturing volume  resulting in higher absorption of manufacturing and field service costs and the completion of refocused product efforts discussed previously 
the improvement in gross margin was partially offset by increased variable compensation costs as a result of improved operating performance 
research  development and engineering applied s future operating results depend  to a considerable extent  on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services it provides 
applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rd e to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers most advanced semiconductor designs 
applied has historically maintained its commitment to investing in rd e in order to continue to offer new products and technologies 
as a result  rd e expenses were billion percent of net sales for fiscal  million percent of net sales for fiscal and million percent of net sales for fiscal development cycles range from to months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of existing technology or a new product 
most of applied s existing product lines are the result of internal product development activities 
in certain instances  applied acquires technologies either in its existing areas of development or through new product opportunities to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 
throughout the periods covered by this report  applied has developed products designed to enable our customers to fabricate chips with nm and below feature sizes  to make use of new materials such as copper and low k dielectrics  and to transition to mm wafer processing 
in fiscal  applied invested in critical development activities to meet its customers rapid move to sub nm dimensions in their most advanced designs  which began entering production in fiscal this difficult and challenging dimensional shift was compounded by the need to provide much of the technology for both mm and mm wafers  requiring additional process and hardware development 
for the sub nm chip generations  inspection and metrology tools became more important to assure enhanced device performance as well as adequate manufacturing yields 
accordingly  applied focused its rd e resources on these technologies 
in addition  development of innovations such as atomic layer deposition  which deposits materials in increasingly smaller structures  and advanced wafer wet cleaning  addressed new market opportunities for applied 
within virtually all of the technology areas  including fab and yield management  applied invested in more advanced software capabilities 

table of contents in fiscal  applied refocused its product efforts and made investments in strategic products 
applied focused on the development of several important processing technologies to enable the production of new chips using copper and low k dielectric materials  as well as to meet the challenges of smaller  nm and below  feature sizes 
in addition to interconnect solutions  applied continued to invest resources in the development of systems for advanced transistor designs with smaller gate structures that enable faster signal propagation and reduced power 
applied also continued the development of its process diagnostic and control capabilities with systems to inspect and measure smaller dimensions and defects 
in fiscal  applied continued its investment in developing new technologies for future generation manufacturing 
advances were made in several key areas  including technology for enhancing transistor and interconnect performance 
applied introduced ten major new products in these areas  including the endura  ecmp  quantum x andg fib systems  all targeted for nm and below chip manufacturing 
in addition  applied introduced the gen akt flat panel system 
marketing  selling  general and administrative marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million percent of net sales for fiscal to million percent of net sales for fiscal  and increased to million percent of net sales for fiscal the decrease from fiscal to was due primarily to headcount reductions and cost reduction activities  limiting discretionary expenditures to align costs to lower business volumes 
the increase from fiscal to correlated to the increase in business volume  as well as increases in variable compensation as a result of improved operating performance 
restructuring  asset impairments and other charges the restructuring actions taken in fiscal  and were intended to better align applied s cost structure with prevailing market conditions due to the industry downturn at the time 
these actions  which were necessary as a result of reduced business volume  reduced applied s global workforce and consolidated global facilities 
restructuring  asset impairments and other charges for fiscal totaled million  consisting of a charge of million for acquired in process research and development and million for restructuring and asset impairment charges 
the restructuring and asset impairment charges consisted of million for headcount reductions  million for consolidation of facilities and million for other costs  primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility consolidation 
restructuring  asset impairments and other charges for fiscal totaled million  consisting of million for headcount reductions  million for consolidation of facilities and million for other costs  primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility consolidation 
as of october   the majority of the fiscal and restructuring actions have been completed  and restructuring reserve balances consist principally of remaining lease commitments associated with facilities 
restructuring  asset impairments and other charges for fiscal totaled million  consisting of million for facility consolidations  million for severance and benefits  and million for other costs  primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility consolidations 
for further details  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation settlements  net litigation settlements  net were million for fiscal and included costs of million related to two separate patent litigation settlements  net of a gain of million related to a legal settlement in favor of applied 
net interest income net interest income was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the decrease in net interest income in fiscal and was due primarily to lower average 
table of contents portfolio yields 
while there were increases in interest rates during fiscal  the benefit to interest income on applied s investment portfolio was limited by the moderate rate of portfolio turnover throughout the year 
income taxes applied s effective income tax provision benefit rate was percent for fiscal  percent for fiscal and percent for fiscal applied s actual effective rate of percent for fiscal differed from the anticipated effective rate of percent primarily due to significant export tax benefits  which resulted from an increase in qualified export sales 
applied expected and experienced an actual effective benefit rate of percent in fiscal applied s actual effective rate of percent for fiscal differed from the anticipated effective rate of percent primarily due to a change in estimates with respect to foreign tax credits  export tax benefits and the geographical composition of worldwide earnings 
applied s future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation  the geographic composition of applied s pre tax income and non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions 
in october  the united states enacted the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act provides for a three year phase out of current extraterritorial income tax eti benefits and replaces eti with a phased in nine percent domestic production activity deduction that will not be fully effective until the act will not fully replace applied s current eti tax benefits 
the act also includes a deduction of for certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the act 
applied may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations 
applied is evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision 
this provision of the act is not expected to have a material effect on applied s results of operations or financial position in the period of implementation 
business combinations on june   applied acquired torrex equipment corporation  a developer of a multi wafer system that utilizes chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition processes to address front end semiconductor manufacturing applications  for million in cash 
on april   applied acquired boxer cross  inc  a producer of in line monitoring systems that provide customers with critical electrical measurement data for controlling semiconductor processes  for million in cash

recent accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity investments  as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance of eitf has been temporarily deferred by the fasb  but the disclosure requirements of eitf are effective for applied s fiscal annual consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  additional disclosures as required by eitf are included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources applied increased its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments from billion at october  to billion at october  applied has not undertaken any significant external financing activities for several years 
applied generated cash from operating activities of million for fiscal  million for fiscal and billion for fiscal the primary sources of cash from operating activities have been net income  as adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges  and changes in working capital levels  including accounts receivable and inventories 
applied utilized programs to sell accounts receivable of million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the sales of these accounts 
table of contents receivables increased cash and reduced accounts receivable and days sales outstanding 
days sales outstanding was days at the end of fiscal  compared to days at the end of fiscal and days at the end of fiscal a portion of these sold accounts receivable is subject to certain limited recourse provisions 
however  applied has not experienced any losses under these programs 
availability and usage of these accounts receivable sale agreements depend on many factors  including the willingness of financial institutions to purchase receivables and the cost of such arrangements 
for further details regarding accounts receivable sales  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventories increased by million in fiscal  which corresponds to the increase in business volume and sales activity from fiscal to fiscal applied used million of cash for investing activities for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal capital expenditures were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal  totaling million for the past three years 
application laboratories  equipment and related facilities have comprised the majority of the capital spending 
fiscal capital expenditures also included million for the purchase of properties in santa clara  california that were previously held under a synthetic lease 
fiscal capital expenditures also included million for the purchase of facilities in hillsboro  oregon that were previously held under a synthetic lease 
investing activities also included purchases and sales of short term investments and acquisitions of technology or of other companies to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies 
fiscal capital expenditures consisted principally of laboratory and demonstration equipment 
applied generated cash of million from financing activities for fiscal and million for fiscal  and used cash of million for fiscal financing activities included issuances and repurchases of common stock 
since march  applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market to partially fund its stock based employee benefit and incentive plans 
cash used to repurchase shares totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal cash generated from issuances of common stock totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal financing activities also included borrowings and repayments of debt 
applied generated cash of million in fiscal from debt borrowings  and did not borrow any cash in fiscal years and cash used for debt repayments totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal on march   applied s board of directors approved a two for one stock split of applied s common stock  which was distributed in the form of a percent stock dividend on or about april  to stockholders of record as of april  although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above  applied s management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy applied s liquidity requirements for the next months 
for further details regarding applied s operating  investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended october   see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this annual report on form k 
off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries 
as of october   the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately million 
applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
applied does not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements 
applied also has additional guarantee arrangements on behalf of certain subsidiaries 
as of october   applied has not recorded any liability related to guarantees of subsidiary obligations 
applied does not expect  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements 
subsidiary guarantees as of october  totaled 
table of contents approximately million and were associated with the following types of arrangements short term borrowing facilities  overdraft facilities  customs guarantees and leases 
in the event of use and subsequent default of these facilities by applied s subsidiaries  such arrangements would be guaranteed by applied 
in addition  certain subsidiaries have lease arrangements guaranteed by applied 
these leases will expire between and in the event that the subsidiaries do not make the required payments  applied could be required to pay the leases on behalf of the subsidiaries 
as of october   annual lease obligations under these arrangements approximated million 
applied materials ventures i  lp the fund invests in privately held  early stage companies engaged in developing systems  components and devices based on nanotechnology and or communications technology for specific applications and products 
the fund is a limited partnership  with applied as the sole limited partner and an independent party as the general partner 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  applied exercised its right to limit capital contributions to the fund to million and to elect to terminate the partnership 
as a result  under the provisions of the partnership agreement  the partnership will be dissolved  and the activities of the partnership will be concluded six months following the election to terminate the partnership 
applied s cumulative capital contributions to the fund totaled approximately million through october  and million through october  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on the fund 
applied also has operating leases for various facilities 
total rental expense for operating leases was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal contractual obligations the following table summarizes applied s contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in millions long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities represents applied s agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied s a outstanding purchase orders for goods and services  b contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods  and c contractual requirements to pay a penalty if the contract is cancelled 
while the amount above represents applied s purchase agreements as of october   the actual amounts to be paid by applied may be less in the event that any agreements are renegotiated  cancelled or terminated 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied s consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied s financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  these policies have the following attributes applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates applied could reasonably have 
table of contents used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as applied s operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section below entitled trends  risks and uncertainties 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that applied s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and provide a meaningful presentation of applied s financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs 
applied s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period 
as applied s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally  labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs 
the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs 
unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs 
if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also reviews goodwill annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  applied may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples approach  and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar industry 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents income taxes applied accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 
applied provides for income taxes based upon an annual estimated effective income tax rate 
the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits 
management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate on a timely basis 
if actual results differ from these estimates  applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied s expectations could have a material impact on applied s results of operations and financial condition 
applied accounts for income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
legal matters applied is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted  that arise in the ordinary course of business 
applied evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and reasonably estimates the amount of the loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of the probability and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
when applied determines that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable  the effect is recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty  applied does not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
however  significant changes in legal proceedings and claims or the factors considered in the evaluation of those matters could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
trends  risks and uncertainties the industry that applied serves is volatile and unpredictable 
as a supplier to the global semiconductor industry  applied is subject to the industry s business cycles  the timing  length and volatility of which are difficult to predict 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand for semiconductors and manufacturing capacity  including capacity using the latest technology 
the rate of changes in demand  including end customer demand  is accelerating  and the effect of these changes on applied is occurring sooner  exacerbating the volatility of these cycles 
these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers capital equipment purchases and investments in technology  and continue to affect applied s orders  net sales  gross margin and results of operations 
during periods of decreasing demand for integrated circuit manufacturing equipment  applied must be able to appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions and effectively motivate and retain key employees 
conversely  during periods of increasing demand  applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand  and must be able to attract  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals 
if applied is not able to timely align its cost structure with business conditions and or to effectively manage its resources and production capacity during changes in demand  applied s business  financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid ongoing changes  including changes in customers capacity requirements and capital spending  which depend in part on customers inventory levels relative to demand for their products  the importance of driving down cost of ownership of systems  more complex technology requirements  the increasing significance of consumer electronics as a driver for chip demand and the related focus on lower prices  varying levels of business information technology spending  the growing types and varieties of integrated circuits and applications  an increasing number of applications across multiple substrate sizes in the semiconductor industry  resulting in divergent interests among semiconductor manufacturers  a rising percentage of business from customers in asia and emergence of customers and competitors in new geographical regions  customer demands for shorter lead times for the manufacture and installation of semiconductor manufacturing equipment  and higher capital requirements for new semiconductor fabrication plants 
these changes  individually or in combination  are increasing the need for customer partnering  use of foundries  collaborative research and development efforts and process integration support 
these changes also heighten the importance of spare parts and service product offerings as a competitive advantage for semiconductor equipment manufacturers  even though service products historically have resulted  and may in the future result  in lower gross margins than system products 
in addition  key integrated circuit manufacturers have become influential in technology decisions made by their global partners 
if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry  its business  financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected 
applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 
in fiscal  more than percent of applied s net sales were to regions outside the united states 
certain manufacturing facilities and suppliers of applied are also located outside the united states 
managing applied s global operations presents challenges including  but not limited to  those arising from periodic regional economic downturns  global trade issues  varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands  variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights in different jurisdictions  differences in the ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses  changes in united states and international laws and regulations  including united states export restrictions  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates  the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations  cultural differences and shipping delays 
many of these challenges are present in china  a large potential market for integrated circuit equipment and an area that applied anticipates will continue to present a significant opportunity for growth over the long term 
these challenges  as well as global uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries  consumer confidence  sustainability  timing  rate and amount of demand for electronics products and semiconductors  capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers  price trends for certain semiconductor devices  and political instability  terrorism or acts of war where applied has operations or sales  including asia  israel and the united states  may materially and adversely affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by increasingly rapid technological changes 
as applied operates in a highly competitive environment  applied s future success is heavily dependent on effective development  commercialization and customer acceptance of its new products and services over those of its competitors 
in addition  applied must also successfully execute its growth strategy  including increasing market share in existing markets  expanding into related markets  and cultivating new markets and business models 
applied s success is subject to many risks  including  but not limited to  its ability to timely and cost effectively develop and market new products  services and technologies  improve existing products  services and technologies  expand into or develop related and new markets for integrated circuit products and services  achieve market acceptance and accurately forecast demand for its products and services  achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings  qualify new or improved products for volume manufacturing with its customers  commence and adjust production to meet customer demands  price products and services appropriately  and lower customers cost of ownership 
the development  introduction and support of an increasingly broad set of new or improved products  services and technologies  
table of contents including those enabling the transition to smaller device feature sizes  new materials and mm wafers  have grown increasingly complex and expensive over time 
such new or improved products and services may involve higher costs and reduced efficiencies compared to applied s more established products and services and could adversely affect applied s gross margins 
in addition  applied must successfully implement changes in its design engineering methodology  including changes that result in significant decreases in material costs and cycle time  greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems  and more effective product life cycle management 
if applied does not develop and introduce new or improved products  services and technologies in a timely and cost effective manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  price such products and services appropriately to reflect changes in costs  or successfully implement changes in its product design processes  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 
applied s customer base is and has been highly concentrated 
although no single customer accounted for percent or more of applied s consolidated net sales in fiscal  orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers of integrated circuits have accounted for  and likely will continue to account for  a substantial portion of applied s net sales 
during fiscal and  there were one and two customers  respectively  that individually accounted for percent or more of applied s consolidated net sales 
in addition  sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
if customers do not place orders  or delay or cancel orders  applied may not be able to replace this business 
as applied s products are configured to customer specifications  changing  rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant  non recoverable costs 
major customers may also demand and receive pricing  payment terms or other conditions which are less favorable to applied 
in addition  certain customers have formed strategic alliances or collaborative efforts that result in additional complexities in managing individual customer relationships and transactions 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is exposed to risks associated with expanded service product offerings and strategic transactions 
in order to improve customers manufacturing productivity and efficiency  applied has entered into  and may in the future enter into  agreements that expand its service product offerings beyond those relating to applied s systems 
these service products include on site support as well as supply chain and spare parts management 
these new service products are offered in part through strategic relationships and alliances formed with  or acquisitions of  other suppliers to the semiconductor industry 
in order to develop this market opportunity  applied must cultivate new business models  form and maintain strategic relationships with appropriate companies  achieve customer acceptance  and successfully and cost effectively provide these services 
applied s inability to achieve any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions 
applied has made  and may in the future make  acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses with complementary or aligned products  services and or technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including but not limited to diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  inability to complete acquisitions as anticipated or at all  inability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition  failure to commercialize purchased technologies  ineffectiveness of an acquired company s internal controls  impairment of acquired intangible assets as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance of the acquired company or its product offerings  unknown and or undisclosed commitments or liabilities  failure to integrate and retain key employees  and ineffective integration of operations 
mergers and acquisitions are inherently subject to significant risks  and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied s ability to meet customer demand  while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory 
applied s business depends on its ability to supply products and services that meet the rapidly changing requirements of its customers  which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts  components and subassemblies collectively  parts from suppliers 
some key parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
in addition  applied outsources certain manufacturing activities 
significant interruptions of manufacturing operations as a result of the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts  outsourcing difficulties  natural disasters such as earthquakes or tornadoes  or other causes such as information technology or infrastructure failures  regional economic downturns  political instability  terrorism or acts of war could result in delayed product or service deliveries or manufacturing inefficiencies 
moreover  if actual demand for applied s products and services is different than expected  applied may purchase more fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling  postponing or expediting delivery of parts 
any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the failure to successfully implement outsourcing activities could adversely affect results of operations 
to better align costs with market conditions and to increase productivity and operational efficiency  applied outsources certain functions to third parties  including companies in india and china 
these functions include engineering  manufacturing  customer support and administrative activities 
the expanding role of third party providers has required changes to applied s existing operations and its adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers 
if applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing strategy  or if third party providers do not perform as anticipated  applied may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties and increased costs  which could materially and adversely affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the ability to attract  retain  and motivate key employees is vital to applied s success 
applied s success depends in large part on its ability to attract  retain and motivate key employees  including those in managerial  technical  marketing and support roles 
achieving this objective may be difficult due to changes in the global economy  the industry  applied s management and proposed changes in accounting rules that would require expensing of stock options 
if applied does not successfully attract  retain and motivate key employees  applied s operating results and ability to capitalize on its opportunities may be materially and adversely affected 
changes in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect future results 
as a global company  applied is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries 
significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities 
applied s future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates  changes in the valuation of applied s deferred tax assets and liabilities  or changes in the tax laws 
for example  recent us legislation governing taxation of extraterritorial income eti repealed certain export subsidies that were prohibited by the world trade organization and enacted different tax provisions 
these new tax provisions are not expected to fully offset the loss of the repealed tax provisions and  as a result  applied s us tax liability may increase 
in addition  applied is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes 
although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable  there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in applied s historical income tax provisions and accruals

applied from time to time is  and in the future may be  involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement  intellectual property rights  antitrust  environmental regulations  securities  contracts  product performance  product liability  unfair competition  employment and other matters 
in addition  applied on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third parties 
these legal proceedings and claims  whether with or without merit  are time consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and divert management s attention and resources 
there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims 
the company has entered into a mutual covenant not to sue arrangement with one of its competitors to avoid patent infringement lawsuits in the future 
there can be no assurance that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved or that applied will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated with such a covenant 
in addition  applied s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented  invalidated  rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change  or applied does not adequately assert these rights 
furthermore  the laws of other countries permit the protection of applied s rights to varying extents  compared to united states laws 
applied s success is dependent in part upon the protection of its intellectual property and other rights 
infringement of applied s rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied 
if applied is not able to resolve a claim  negotiate a settlement of the matter  obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  and or successfully prosecute or defend its position  applied s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment 
applied is subject to various risks related to new  different  inconsistent or even conflicting laws  rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies and or regulatory agencies in the countries in which applied operates and with which applied must comply  and disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade

based on applied s ratios of investments to total assets and of interest income to net income  applied could be deemed to be covered by the investment company act

if the sec does not grant the exemption  applied may have to take other actions that could adversely affect its results of operations in order not to be subject to the investment company act 
applied is subject to risks of non compliance with environmental and safety regulations 
applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its business operations  including  but not limited to  regulations related to the development  manufacture and use of its products

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at october   applied s investment portfolio included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately billion 
applied s primary objective for investing in fixed income securities is to preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
based on applied s investment portfolio at october  and october   an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately million and million  respectively 
while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio  applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery 
applied s long term debt bears interest primarily at fixed rates 
as such  applied s interest expense would increase only to the extent that applied significantly increased the amount of variable rate obligations outstanding 
due to the short term nature and relatively low amount of applied s variable rate obligations  an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies  such as japanese yen  british pound  euro and israeli shekel 
applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within months 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on applied s results of operations for fiscal  or forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions primarily japanese yen  british pound  euro and israeli shekel  and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions 
applied s outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged  therefore  the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
applied s risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option 
premiums paid for options outstanding at october  were not material
