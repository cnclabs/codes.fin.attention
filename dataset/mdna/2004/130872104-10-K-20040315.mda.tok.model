part item business overview caliper life sciences  formerly caliper technologies corp  uses its core technologies of liquid handling  automation  and labchip microfluidics to create leading edge tools for the life sciences industry 
in  caliper acquired zymark corporation  a pioneer and worldwide leader in the field of liquid handling  laboratory automation and robotics 
following this acquisition  caliper reorganized its senior management team  including a new chief executive officer  and adopted new strategies to deliver applications to the life sciences industry that we believe will have more immediate commercial relevance 
within the life sciences industry  caliper is currently addressing three major markets drug discovery and development  genomics and proteomics and molecular diagnostics 
we believe that our products and technologies are uniquely capable of addressing these markets in a number of ways 
for example  with the recent advances in genomics research and subsequent surge of interest in protein functionality  there is an increased industry need for high throughput  cost efficient tools for dna and protein experimentation 
products such as our labchip system for high throughput dna and protein analysis directly address this need by integrating and automating the multiple steps required by conventional gel electrophoresis experiments 
in the drug discovery and development market  pharmaceutical companies face the new challenge of their increased research and development spending yielding fewer new drugs 
caliper is focused on helping pharmaceutical companies address this challenge by providing tools that help researchers make better choices earlier in their drug discovery process  as well as tools that are designed to increase the general speed and efficiency of their high throughput screening efforts 
molecular diagnostics  another significant scientific frontier that has evolved from the genomics revolution  holds enormous potential to impact human health through earlier detection of disease 
however  existing molecular diagnostic tests tend to be expensive  limiting their acceptance by health care organizations already burdened by high costs 
we believe that our labchip technologies can address the cost issues through integration and miniaturization of the various steps required to carry out these tests 

table of contents we have three channels of distribution for our products direct to customers  indirect through our international network of distributors  and through original equipment manufacturer oem channels 
through our direct and indirect distributor channels  we sell complete systems solutions  developed by caliper  to end customers 
our oem distribution channel  of which agilent technologies  inc agilent is a prime example  is core to our business strategy and complementary to our direct sales and distribution network activities as it enables us to extend the commercial potential of our microfluidic labchip and advanced liquid handling technologies into new industries and new applications with experienced commercial partners 
in the oem channel we provide liquid handling products  chips and enabling technologies to commercial partners who then typically integrate the application solution and market it to their end customers 
by using direct  indirect distribution  and oem channels to maximize penetration of our products and technologies into the marketplace  caliper seeks to position itself as a leader in the life science tools market

table of contents technologies microfluidic labchip technologies we have developed our microfluidic labchip technology to provide significant advances in laboratory experimentation for the pharmaceutical and other industries 
microfluidic chips are the key components of our labchip systems  which also include a specific labchip instrument together with experiment specific reagents and software 
our chips contain a network of miniaturized or microfabricated channels through which fluids and chemicals are moved to perform experiments 
a single type of chip used with customized reagents and software to perform a particular experiment make up one labchip application 
depending on the chip format  reagents are introduced either automatically or by the user 
the chip is then placed in the instrument  which uses software to control the movement of fluids with pressure or voltage 
the instrument also has an optical system for detecting the results 
because we have great flexibility in channel design and can exert split second computer control over fluid flow  we have the ability to create chips for a multitude of applications 
our labchip systems miniaturize  integrate and automate experiments with the goal of providing the benefits of improved data accuracy  reduced cost  and higher speed  leading to expanded individual researcher capability and improved enterprise wide productivity 
features of labchip systems miniaturization 
conventional laboratory equipment typically uses at least a drop of fluid  to microliters  to perform each experiment 
in many labchip applications  the sample volume needed from external sources is reduced to below nanoliter  an improvement of up to  fold over conventional systems 
in some processes within the chip  reagents are dispensed in the microchannels in volumes down to tens of picoliters  another fold reduction  which speeds analysis times and increases sample throughput 
a microliter is one millionth of a liter  a nanoliter is one billionth of a liter  and a picoliter is one trillionth of a liter 
integration 
integration is the compression of multiple processes into a single process  or the inclusion of multiple functions into one device 
today most laboratory systems perform only one or two steps of an experimental protocol 
our labchip systems can integrate complete experiments involving half a dozen or more steps into one continuous process performed on a single chip 
automation 
many laboratory experiments are performed in multiple manual steps 
with our labchip systems  entire experiments can be automated and performed inside a chip using one instrument  freeing up valuable research time and laboratory space 
key benefits of labchip systems improved data quality and accuracy 
our labchip systems are designed to produce more accurate and consistent data by reducing human error and the variability caused by the use of multiple instruments 
with higher quality data  our customers can make better decisions 
for example  biochemical determinations typically require accurate liquid measurements and precise incubation times 
when these are manually performed significant variations can occur in liquid dispensing and in the duration of reaction times 
improved sensitivity 
when screening against drug targets such as kinases  the higher quality data from our labchip systems allows customers to detect candidate compounds that inhibit the drug target at lower levels than can be detected with traditional microplate well based assays 
the ability to detect these low level inhibition hits has two advantages increasing the pool of potential lead compounds by finding candidate compounds not detectable using other methods and compounds that are active at lower inhibition levels potentially have higher selectivity for the drug target of interest  giving them a higher probability of becoming actual drug products 
reduced reagent and labor cost 
our labchip systems utilize only a small fraction of the usual amount of expensive reagents used in experiments performed in test tubes  well plates  or well plates  and also reduce labor involved in each experiment 
we believe that saving on reagent cost and 
table of contents labor can enable pharmaceutical companies to expand the scale of experimentation in ways that would otherwise not be feasible 
high speed 
we believe our labchip systems can accelerate some experiments as much as fold or more  depending on the application 
for example  molecular separations such as electrophoresis may take two hours or more using conventional equipment 
on a chip  we can perform these separations in less than one minute 
another example is that chemical reactions are routinely incubated for minutes or more before the results are determined 
often  these long incubation periods are necessary only to provide sufficient time for manual steps to be performed on large numbers of samples 
by integrating sample processing and detection  we can perform reactions in one minute or less and achieve comparable results 
our customers may be able to take advantage of this acceleration to increase throughput or to complete experiments faster  depending on their needs 
expanded individual researcher capability 
because our labchip systems can collapse a multi step  complex experiment into one step  we believe that individual researchers can perform experiments previously outside their areas of expertise 
by comparison  with conventional  non integrated equipment  researchers need to acquire the equipment and master the complexities of performing each individual step 
improved enterprise wide productivity 
we believe our labchip systems can improve data quality to the point where researchers can rely on data generated outside their laboratory or organization 
we believe this would improve enterprise wide productivity by supporting data sharing and reducing the need to repeat experiments 
when different research groups use different assortments of conventional equipment to perform experiments  they often produce data that are not strictly comparable 
we believe that our microfluidic labchip systems have the potential to expand the capabilities and improve the productivity of individual researchers and  on an institutional level  to streamline and bring greater efficiency and speed to the drug discovery and development process 
not all laboratory processes  however  are ideally suited to be performed using our labchip systems 
for example  detecting clinically important materials that appear in low concentrations in a sample  such as the virus that causes aids  is not always practical with our microfluidic labchip systems 
this is because there is a risk that the virus will not be present in the very small volumes employed by our chips 
as a result  in certain applications use of our microfluidic labchip system may require the pre processing of a sample to increase concentration 
furthermore  if the analysis of a sample must involve even one process that cannot currently be performed in the microfluidic labchip system  then use of the microfluidic labchip system for the parts it can perform is often impractical 
this is because the very small scale of the chip experiment does not generally produce enough material to be analyzed by conventional laboratory equipment 
liquid handling automation technologies zymark  prior to the acquisition  had a long history of advanced liquid handling and laboratory automation expertise that has resulted in a variety of proprietary technologies  including software  that we use in robotics and precision liquid handling systems 
current technologies in development include the miniaturization of fluidic systems  robotics for transportation of higher density testing platforms  such as biochips  high efficiency liquid handling workstations  and the development of software to automate  control and promote integration capability 
our liquid handling systems provide fast and accurate liquid transfers and plate reformatting in multiple microplate formats and are characterized by their open and modular design to address a wide range of applications 
we have developed some key technologies such as interchangeable pipetting heads  a feature of our sciclone alh  and multi channel pipetting capability  a feature of the sciclone inl  that differentiate our liquid handling systems from those of our competitors 
the sciclone inl is our most advanced liquid handling system 
in addition to many of the features of the sciclone alh  the sciclone 
table of contents inl has high speed solenoid valves that ensure efficient non contact through the air dispensing of nanoliter volumes of liquids and reliable delivery to microplates 
this technology is able to generate real time performance data and automatically reacts to changing conditions such as temperature that can alter the sample viscosity 
each pipetting channel can dispense an independent volume and offers its own liquid level detection capability  allowing scientists to poll a plate to determine the liquid level volume in each well 
the benefit of this type of control over the dispensing and monitoring of fluids is higher quality data and increased probability that a particular experiment will not have to be repeated 
products and services our portfolio of products includes high and ultra high throughput screening systems  liquid handlers  advanced robotics  storage devices  dissolution  extraction and evaporation workstations  and easy to use software that controls scheduling  integration and data management 
in addition  we derive a substantial portion of revenue from service and aftermarket products  including consumable and accessory products such as labchip devices  pipette tips  filters  glassware  and storage trays 
high throughput screening systems and integrated workstations allegro automated systems 
our allegro platform is designed to eliminate screening bottlenecks while offering maximum flexibility and performance across a range of drug discovery applications  including high throughput screening hts  ultra high throughput screening uhts  and high speed preparation of or well microplates  which are plates that have wells in them in which the reagents are stored 
the demand for maximum throughput in screening procedures often requires a larger industrial process rather than a laboratory workstation approach 
the allegro system connects independent workstation modules consisting of storage and incubation carousels  washers  liquid handlers and readers in an assembly line format 
modules are added to incorporate additional steps or increase a system s capabilities 
allegro s ultra high throughput is realized when intramodule process times are kept under one minute 
under these conditions  allegro can process approximately  well plates  assays per day two shifts 
labchip drug discovery system second generation of the caliper drug discovery system 
the labchip system is our next generation microfluidic system for the drug discovery market 
the labchip replaced the caliper which was launched in september and was a very early version of a microfluidic based screening application system 
the labchip represents a significant advancement in industrial design  functional reliability and reduced cost 
the automated drug discovery system performs unattended high volume screening  producing high quality data that minimizes false positives and false negatives  and detects weak inhibitors with high accuracy  potentially identifying drug candidates that conventional techniques can miss 
a broad suite of assays has been developed for enzymatic drug targets such as kinases  proteases and phosphatases 
the labchip is also capable of running cell based assays that screen the effects of candidate drug compounds directly on cells 
the labchip system uses our proprietary sipper chips  which allow automated sampling from or well plates 
each chip has either or sippers  small glass tubes that are part of the chip 
once the researcher prepares the chip and places it into a labchip system  minute quantities of sample can be introduced  or sipped  through the capillary to the chip 
this sipping process can be repeated many times  enabling a single chip to analyze thousands of samples quickly and without human intervention 
samples on sipper chips are processed utilizing continuous flow designs with integrated channel networks for complete experiments 
compared to its predecessor  the caliper  the labchip is more robustly engineered  with a completely new commercial design that reduces the overall size of the platform to approximately one third of its original size 
we have reduced the cost of manufacturing in order to produce acceptable profit margins for the product  while also allowing for a lower price to the end user 
assays developed for the caliper are directly transferable to the labchip system

management believes that our ability to service clients through its global service infrastructure is an important competitive strength of our company and will be a critical ingredient to growth in the near and long term future 
service contracts are typically for one year terms 
key corporate partnerships a key element of our growth strategy is the formation of strategic collaborations with other life science technology providers and our customers 
we believe these relationships will allow us to enhance our strong market position by increasing our research and development capabilities 
under these arrangements  our collaborators typically fund a portion of our development costs for a particular product and work with our research and development team to develop new products that meet the needs of our customer base 
agilent technologies agilent is a global  diversified technology company focusing on high growth markets in the communications  electronics  life sciences and healthcare industries 
from may through may  agilent and caliper collaborated to create and distribute commercial research products based on caliper microfluidic labchip technologies 
the relationship effectively combined agilent s expertise in the life sciences marketplace with caliper s microfluidic innovation to bring novel products to market 
in september  agilent introduced the bioanalyzer system  which uses caliper s labchip devices 
since that time  agilent and caliper have expanded the agilent bioanalyzer application menu to nine labchip kits capable of rna  dna  protein and cell analyses 
effective in may  the collaboration agreement was terminated by us as permitted under the terms of the agreement 
the existing collaboration agreement with agilent sets forth the nature of the companies commercial product supply relationships for a three year period after termination 
our principal motivation in terminating the formal agreement with agilent was to give us more flexibility in developing new applications with other commercial partners 
termination of the agreement will also provide us with greater ability to market and sell existing products in the field of the collaboration directly to end user customers  in part utilizing the reciprocal supply arrangements set forth in the termination provisions of the agreement 
both parties will operate under the existing termination provisions of the collaboration agreement unless we establish new terms with agilent 
in our collaboration with agilent  we had primarily focused on developing core labchip technology and product applications 
we have also manufactured the chips and supplied the chips and reagents to agilent 
agilent has primarily focused on developing instruments and software  manufacturing instruments and marketing  selling and supporting complete systems 
agilent and caliper have worked in a collaborative manner to identify new applications for development and distribution 
historically agilent has also provided product development funding to us 
we are presently only receiving minimal development funding from agilent as a result of the termination of the agreement 
however  we anticipate some level of product development funding will be received from agilent this year 
under the continuing terms of the collaboration  agilent purchases chips and reagents at a price which reimburses us for our costs of manufacturing chips and reagents and pays us a share of the gross margin on sales by agilent of all components of labchip systems  including instruments 
we recognize revenue related 
table of contents to the reimbursement of costs for the supply of chips and reagents to agilent upon shipment and we recognize the related costs as components of cost of sales 
we recognize as revenue our share of gross margin on components of the systems sold by agilent upon shipment to the end user 
this general structure for existing products survives termination of the agreement 
our gross margin share varies depending on the type of collaboration product  and on whether agilent or we manufacture the collaboration product 
our gross margin share for existing products will remain the same until november in november  our gross margin share for chips and reagents will decrease  and in may our gross margin share for chips and reagents will decrease again 
our gross margin share for existing instruments will also decrease in the same time periods  although at somewhat different rates 
agilent has a non exclusive license in the field of the collaboration to our labchip technology as it existed in may to develop  manufacture and sell new products in that field 
agilent will be required to pay royalties to caliper based on its net revenue from sales of such products at the established royalty rates set forth in the termination provisions of our collaboration agreement 
affymetrix in january  we established a collaboration and supply agreement to develop and provide automated target preparation instruments for affymetrix commercialized proprietary microarray system  its new high throughput array system and other future microarray platforms 
these new automation systems are expected to substantially reduce array processing time  reduce variability and labor costs  and enable researchers to industrialize their genomic research

affymetrix will market and distribute the line of automation products developed under the multi year agreement 
we will serve as an oem provider and partner with affymetrix to provide installation  training and field support for these new automated systems 
amphora discovery corp 
amphora  a company we created in september  has engaged in large scale implementation of labchip drug discovery systems purchased directly from us 
however  we no longer have a significant ownership interest in amphora 
under our agreement with amphora  we charge amphora both for systems purchased as well as datapoints generated 
since its inception and through december   amphora has purchased caliper drug discovery systems and million in datapoints 
total revenues from amphora decreased from million in to million in  or 
of the million in total sales   related to drug discovery system products sold to amphora prior to  and million related to datapoints 
we expect amphora to buy one additional labchip drug discovery system in under our agreements with amphora  which we renegotiated in december  amphora is not obligated to make any further datapoint payments to us until they have generated the number of datapoints that amphora is entitled to as a result of the following payments they paid or are required to pay us a million minimum datapoint payment for the months ending november   and b any payments made pursuant to a million deferred contingent obligation through quarterly payments based on amphora s revenue or commissions earned by amphora for marketing assistance 
if amphora generates fewer datapoints than the number to which they are entitled due to the minimum payment and any contingent payments made  our future datapoint revenues will be adversely affected to the extent of this shortfall 
bio rad laboratories in june  caliper and bio rad entered into a multi year product development and commercialization agreement to develop and market a novel microfluidics instrument system for worldwide distribution 
caliper is contributing its expertise in microfluidic labchip technologies to automate  integrate and 
table of contents miniaturize multiple experimental steps on a small chip for ease of use  increased efficiency and higher quality results versus conventional methods 
under the terms of the agreement  caliper will receive research and development funding from bio rad  will be paid royalties on all future sales of instruments and software  and will be the exclusive manufacturer of labchip devices 
wako pure chemical industries in  caliper established a collaboration with wako of japan to develop a new microfluidics based instrument and chips designed for the worldwide immunodiagnostics market 
the new system is intended to provide a faster  more highly automated  and more cost effective approach to running diagnostic blood panels in the clinical laboratory setting 
under the terms of the agreement  wako will provide immunodiagnostic reagents for the system  while caliper will develop chips and microfluidic assays 
an undisclosed third party will be responsible for manufacturing the instrument system  with wako retaining primary distribution rights 
further terms of the agreement are not being disclosed 
backlog we define backlog as the total value of open orders for products and services that management has concluded have a reasonable probability of being delivered over the subsequent twelve month period 
the level of backlog at december  was approximately million and at december  was zero 
the increase year over year in backlog is the result of our acquisition of zymark  prior to which we did not maintain a backlog 
for a portion of our sales  we manufacture product based upon our forecast of customer demand and maintain inventories of completed modules in advance of receipt of orders from our customers 
our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter and shipments from backlog  and from recognition of revenues that had been previously recorded as deferred revenue pursuant to our revenue recognition policy 
many of our products are typically shipped within ninety days of purchase order receipt 
as a result  we do not believe that the amount of backlog at any particular date is indicative of our future level of sales in any succeeding quarter 
our backlog at the beginning of each quarter does not include all product sales needed to achieve expected revenues for that quarter 
consequently  we are dependent on obtaining orders for products to be shipped in the same quarter that the order is received 
moreover  customers may reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
accordingly  we have limited visibility of future product shipments  and our results of operations are subject to variability from quarter to quarter 
customers prior to acquiring zymark  we received a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of sources 
in the year ended december   revenue from agilent  our major collaboration partner  accounted for of our total revenue and of our product revenue 
agilent represented of pro forma total revenue for see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the acquisition of zymark resulted in an immediate broadening of our customer base  as well as a broadening of our product line  and as such we anticipate that the sources of revenue will be significantly diversified in the future 
in addition  the global commercial infrastructure we acquired through the zymark acquisition enhances our ability to expand into new geographical markets  further increasing the diversity of our customer base 
our current customers include the world s leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as oem providers of complementary life science solutions 
approximately  and of our total revenues for  and  respectively  were derived from customers in the united states 
see note to our financial statements located at the end of this annual report for a description of revenues from external customers attributable to geographic areas 
substantially all of our long lived assets are located in the united states 

table of contents research and development we have made substantial investments in lab on a chip research since our inception  and believe that we have established a leading position in lab on a chip technology 
we explored fundamental issues of lab on a chip technology as early as possible in order to find solutions to important technical challenges and seek patent protection for our solutions 
with the re alignment of caliper following our acquisition of zymark  we have made some important changes to our approach to research and development 
first  we are now emphasizing what we refer to as a sequential  rather than parallel  approach to our r d projects  meaning that we are now undertaking r d projects in a more sequential manner  rather than pursuing all of our projects at the same time 
in doing this  we are prioritizing those projects that we believe have the greatest potential commercial value 
second  we are now also emphasizing a shared investment risk approach to r d in which we have our customers or potential customers share in the expense of an r d project 
we believe that this shared investment risk model is important not only because it reduces our own r d expense  but also provides important customer validation that a particular r d project has potential commercial value to our customers 
through all of these measures  we anticipate that in the future we will be able to gain greater control of our significant r d expenses 
today we are supplementing these core technology research efforts with applied product development efforts in several areas technology research our technology research activities fall into several classes 
chip design 
we are increasing our understanding of the design rules guiding the development of new chips 
using the principles of engineering  we create patterns of interconnected channels that permit execution of the various common steps of experimentation 
designs from one chip can be used for other chips needing similar fluidic functions for a different application 
mathematics and computer models also help minimize the number of iterations necessary to achieve new functional chip designs 
chip manufacturing 
we continue to seek ways to improve the yield and decrease the cost of manufacturing our chips 
we are exploring novel fabrication techniques and the use of new materials that offer functional advantages  such as manufacturing in quartz to take advantage of its superior optical features 
we have development programs in manufacturing technology for chips made of plastic 
plastic devices potentially offer cost advantages and can offer favorable surface chemical features for some applications 
a major area of development is micromachining technology for precisely attaching capillaries to our sipper chips to access reagents 
in automated experimentation  the number of capillaries and channels running in parallel determines the level of throughput 
accordingly  we have developed high yield fabrication methods to enable us to cost effectively manufacture chips with many capillaries to perform high throughput experimentation 
instrument manufacturing and software design 
we use the skills of electrical engineers  optical engineers  mechanical engineers  product designers and software engineers to create new instrumentation and software 
the instruments are designed to optimize liquid handling and automation of life science laboratory applications  or to control fluid movement and detection functionality for our microfluidic chips 
software engineers write computer programs to manage tasks such as controlling chip functionality  collecting data  communicating between different instrument modules or communicating between caliper s and other manufacturer s instruments 
currently  our instrument research and development efforts are focused on the miniaturization of fluidics  robotics for transportation of higher density testing platforms  such as biochips  high efficiency liquid handling workstations  the development of software to promote integration capability  and continued development of productivity workstations for genomics and biotech 
systems integration 
when developing commercial labchip products  we ensure that we incorporate all the features necessary for performing a specific experiment and configure the assay so that it offers tangible 
table of contents benefits to users 
by carefully characterizing the problem  as well as the microfluidic solution  we are able to define precise product specifications 
for instance  in each application  we determine how to manipulate flow conditions and how to control surface interactions in order to create novel functions and or suppress undesirable effects 
the resulting complete solution includes the labchip device  the instrument interface  computer software and reagents needed for each total microfluidic application 
applications development we have developed a large amount of expertise at discovering new functions that microfluidic chips can perform 
we have generated proprietary computer models of how an experiment can be carried out 
we store these functional designs  and we can incorporate them into new designs that simulate complete experimental pathways 
in this way  we believe the value of new microfluidic inventions can be rapidly expanded across many application development projects 
we have also developed expertise conducting a variety of laboratory experiments in our chips 
a current area of focus is kinase selectivity screening  for which we use our labchip devices to address the need of pharmaceutical drug discovery labs to understand how candidate drug compounds react with a particular kinase drug target relative to other kinase molecules in the human body  with potential impact on the safety and efficacy of the resultant drug 
our research efforts in this area have included the development of more than methods that are provided to the customer to facilitate easy implementation of their kinase selectivity screening efforts 
we have also developed sipper chips  which enable automated sample input into the chip  allowing for high throughput experimentation 
these sipper chips perform enzyme reactions using part of the channel design as a tiny  continuously operating electrophoresis machine 
thus  reactions with one sample are going on in one area of the chip while electrophoretic separation of the products of another sample is taking place in a different part of the chip 
such an assembly line approach yields highly reproducible data unmatched by macroscopic formats 
in general  our experience is that microfabrication and microfluidics provide a rich tool set with which to create innovative new applications 
we have increased our application focus on our more traditional macrofluidic automation products as well such as our products for liquid handling  plate handling  and complete automated systems 
our applications group works closely with key customers to understand their critical application needs 
these needs are then addressed directly by developing specific automation configurations and software specified methods  optimized for key applications such as cell based assays  nucleic acid purification  mass spectrometry sample preparation and others 
for example  our staccato platform has been configured specifically for cell based assays and is now marketed as a standard application system 
product development our product development efforts are currently focused principally on new applications and capabilities for our existing instruments and the development of new instrument platforms 
extensions of existing product lines 
for our labchip instrument systems  we are expanding the menu of applications to include assays that measure many important activities of cells and proteins 
our recently introduced products include a new sipper labchip device and an on chip mobility shift assay available on an early release basis  both well suited to kinase testing 
for the labchip automated electrophoresis system  we recently announced a new labchip device for higher throughout protein separations  that is scheduled to be released in april extensions to our liquid handling and automation product lines are ongoing 
these include the development of additional application based staccato systems that take advantage of our iblox technology to rapidly reconfigure these systems for specific applications and the further development of our liquid handling automation to include nanoliter dispensing and feedback control capability 
we are also developing extensions of certain existing products to address applications of high interest to our partners such as the automation of target preparation for affymetrix commercialized proprietary microarray system 

table of contents rare molecule detection 
rare molecule detection has potential utility for a variety of molecular diagnostic applications including early detection and screening for a variety of cancers 
like all experimentation processes  this application is a combination of various fluid manipulations  biochemical reactions and detection 
we are developing an integrated application that is designed to perform the steps of reagent assembly  amplification and readout in rapid  serial fashion inside the channels of a microfluidic chip 
we believe that our rare molecule detection technology will offer the advantages of nanoliter scale processing of valuable reagents  automated reagent assembly and computer controlled heating and mixing for high quality data production 
though our nanoliter scale system is still in development  we are capable of doing hour unattended runs involving thousands of nanoliter reactions with starting material down to single copies of genomic dna 
compared to conventional methods  which take about hours  we can do a complete amplification and detection reaction in about minutes 
this underscores the benefits that can be achieved by integrating and automating multiple complex experimental steps on a single chip 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december    and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we expect research and development spending to decrease in the future as we slow the pace of discretionary spending on research programs  focus on those opportunities with maximum commercial viability and share the funding of r d programs with other partners 
manufacturing effective in november  we consolidated all instrument manufacturing into our hopkinton  massachusetts iso compliant manufacturing facility 
iso  the international standards organization  sets international standards for quality in product design  manufacturing and distribution 
we manufacture some subassemblies ourselves and other components are made to our specifications by outside vendors 
the workstations are produced from components based on a wide variety of proprietary technologies  including intricate mechanical actuators  precision fluid handling systems  computers and software 
our top suppliers are tracked monthly using a scorecard to insure the quality and on time delivery of parts and subassemblies 
the subassemblies are inspected and tested using on line procedures within each work cell before being placed into final product assemblies 
the workstations are then put through an extensive testing cycle before being released for shipment 
production cycle times range from several hours to five days for more complex workstations 
we produce the systems by combining our products with third party vendor equipment  primarily detection instrumentation 
the systems are a combination of standard components assembled in either standard or custom configurations to meet a customer s specific needs 
the components are built exactly like the workstation products  and using clara software  the components are integrated to create an application to effectively run complex assays on these system configurations 
a typical production cycle ranges from to days from receipt of order to shipment of a system 
customer acceptance at both our factory and the customer s site guarantees that the system is performing to the customer s specifications 
we manufacture all of our chips in a class clean room facility in mountain view  california 
caliper is iso compliant for the development  manufacture and distribution of its chips  reagents and systems 
agilent manufactures and distributes the agilent bioanalyzer under a license from caliper 
we contract with third parties to supply raw materials  component parts and sub assemblies used in our chips  reagents and instrument systems 
we intend to continue to invest in our infrastructure for the manufacture and distribution of our chips and to continue to work with third parties for outsourcing opportunities for non chip based products 
for a discussion of the methods we use to manufacture our chips see technology and research and development 
suppliers key components of our chips  instruments and reagent based products are obtained from a number of single source or limited source suppliers 
we rely on a privately held company for the supply of proprietary dyes used in many of our labchip products 
furthermore  we depend on a foreign single source supplier for 
table of contents the manufacture of glass stock used in the manufacture of certain types of our chips 
the majority of our key components for our chip and instrument products are readily available from our suppliers to meet production requirements 
the only component requiring any significant lead time to acquire is our proprietary glass stock  as our supplier requires a minimum order to cover an entire production run 
we anticipate that inventories of this proprietary material  at current production levels  will be sufficient for the next months 
although we have established licensing arrangements and supply agreements with these suppliers  as well as other single or limited source suppliers  there can be no assurances that these companies would not in some way be adversely affected in the future and be unable to meet our critical supply needs 
in the event that the supply of components from these suppliers and other single source or limited source suppliers were interrupted  we may not be able to manufacture  or manufacture in a timely fashion or in significant quantities  our products  which would delay our ability to deliver products to our customers 
commodity price risk some of the raw materials we use are subject to price volatility caused by supply conditions  economic variables and other unpredictable factors 
historically we have not experienced significant supply or price constraints and we do not expect our financial position  profitability and liquidity to be affected materially by the supply level fluctuations 
competition we encounter competition from a number of life science tools companies  especially in the areas of high throughput screening  liquid handling  and separations analysis 
we anticipate that our competitors will come primarily from companies providing competitive liquid handling and automation products for screening applications similar to ours  including systems integrators  but based on established technologies  and incremental improvements to these products  companies developing new non chip technologies that can be used in applications similar to the ones that can be served by our labchip technology 
in order to compete against vendors of conventional products  we will need to demonstrate the advantages of our products over alternative well established technologies and products 
we will also need to demonstrate the potential economic value of our products relative to these conventional technologies and products 
lastly  we will need to demonstrate the value of combining our labchip products with our own conventional liquid handling and automation solutions to further differentiate our products from our competitors products 
some of the companies that provide conventional products include the applied biosystems division of applera  agilent  amersham biosciences  beckman coulter  bio rad laboratories  molecular devices  perkinelmer and tecan 
we will also need to compete effectively with companies developing their own microfluidics or lab on a chip technologies and products  such as fluidigm  gyros  micronics  microfluidic systems and nanostream 
other companies known to have initiated microfluidic programs include aclara biosciences  motorola  m  applied biosystems  and cepheid 
microfluidic technologies have undergone and are expected to continue to undergo rapid and significant change 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in these and future technologies  which we may not be able to do 
rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete 
products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies 
in addition  there is the possibility that we may experience competition from agilent in the future 
under the terms of our agreement  agilent has a non exclusive  royalty bearing license to certain of our labchip technologies 
under the terms of this license  agilent is able to develop  make and sell products in the field of our collaboration with agilent 

table of contents in many instances  our competitors have or will have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than we do 
moreover  competitors may have greater name recognition than we do  and may offer discounts as a competitive tactic 
we cannot assure you that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products  or that would render our technologies and products obsolete 
also  we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our technologies 
intellectual property we seek patent protection on our lab on a chip technologies 
as of december   we owned or held licenses to issued us patents and approximately pending us patent applications  some of which derive from a common parent application 
the issued us patents expire between and foreign counterparts of many of these patents and applications have been filed and or issued in one or more other countries  resulting in a total of more than issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states and foreign countries 
these patents and applications are directed to various technological areas which we believe are valuable to our business  including control of movement of fluid and other material through interconnected microchannels  continuous flow high throughput screening assay methods and systems  analytical and control instrumentation  analytical system architecture  automated liquid handling systems  chip based assay chemistries and methods  chip compatible sample accession  software for control of microfluidic based systems and data analysis  and chip manufacturing processes 
we also rely upon copyright protection  trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes  to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets  to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products used with our lab on a chip technology 
we are party to various exclusive and non exclusive license agreements with third parties which give us rights to use certain technologies 
for example  we have licenses in the fields we are currently operating in from ut battelle  llc  relating to patents covering inventions by dr 
j 
michael ramsey  and from the trustees of the university of pennsylvania covering microfluidic applications and chip structures 
a failure to maintain some or all of the rights to these technologies could seriously harm our business 
environmental matters we continuously assess the compliance of our operations with applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
our policy is to record liabilities for environmental matters when loss amounts are probable and reasonably determinable 
our manufacturing site utilizes chemicals and other potentially hazardous materials and generates both hazardous and non hazardous waste  the transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of which are regulated by various governmental agencies 
we have engaged environmental consultants on a regular basis to assist with our compliance efforts 
we believe we are currently in compliance with all applicable environmental permits and are aware of our responsibilities under applicable environmental laws 
any expenditures necessitated by changes in law and permitting requirements cannot be 
table of contents predicted at this time  although such costs are not expected to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
other business risks in addition to the risks to our business associated with suppliers  competition and intellectual property discussed above  our business is subject to a number of other significant risks  including the risks that our labchip products may not achieve wide market acceptance  we may not be successful in developing new and enhanced liquid handling products  and we may not be successful in obtaining all of the cost saving and other synergies expected from the zymark acquisition 
these and other risks that may cause our actual results  financial performance or achievements to be materially different from our present expectations are discussed in more detail below under factors affecting operating results contained in part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which discussion is incorporated by reference here

since its founding in  the strategy of the company has been to invest in microfluidic technology in order to develop innovative solutions to improve  and in some cases provide new  applications in the life science tools space 
that investment over the last eight years has been considerable and the company has  in fact  developed numerous products by itself and in collaboration with partners eg  agilent 
these products have been introduced commencing in up through the present 
however  during this time a number of factors occurred that hindered caliper from becoming financially self sufficient from an operating cash flow perspective 
the general economy has been extremely challenging for suppliers of capital equipment used for research in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  combined with the challenge of gaining adoption of caliper s radically new microfluidic technology in markets where established alternatives are available  especially with caliper s undeveloped commercial infrastructure 
the process and challenges of building and maintaining a commercial organization of sufficient scale were significant 
early in it became apparent to caliper s management that the overall adoption rate of our products was not robust enough to support caliper s ongoing r d and commercialization expenses 
even though caliper s cash balances were significant  there was no assurance that the cash resources would provide sufficient liquidity for the company to get to a positive cash flow state 
zymark acquisition in an effort to address these challenges and not sacrifice the core strategy of the company caliper acquired zymark corporation  a pioneer and leader in the field of laboratory automation  robotics and advanced liquid handling solutions  in july zymark  founded in  manufactured and sold products and services to a multitude of customers in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical  agriculture and food industries worldwide 
our strategy now is to evolve the company s various product platforms into technologically advanced liquid handling and labchip systems that offer efficiency  versatility  and high quality data to customers for genomics and proteomics  and drug discovery research applications 
additionally  the company is focusing research efforts in the molecular diagnostics market to develop labchip systems for early disease diagnosis  and is actively pursuing technical feasibility studies with partners 
we utilize three distribution channels for our products 
in some cases  we sell instruments and chips directly to end users 
in other instances we sell products to commercial partners  who in turn sell these products to end users 
following the acquisition of zymark  we also sell our products through a global network of approximately independent distributors  who in turn sell our products to end users 
on july   we completed the acquisition of zymark 
the principal goals of the acquisition included gaining access to a global sales and marketing distribution platform to accelerate adoption and 
table of contents penetration of our microfluidic technologies  accelerating our commercial transition by building upon the capabilities of a more commercially experienced management team  and bolstering caliper s path to profitability by increasing revenues  reducing expenses through combination synergies and reducing our net losses and cash utilization 
the acquisition of zymark resulted in a substantial increase in our overall customer base and expanded our ability to market our products  including into new geographic territories 
we anticipate the acquisition of zymark will allow us to leverage our microfluidic labchip technology and product discovery engine with zymark s proven substantial commercial organization focused on laboratory automation 
we acquired zymark from the berwind company llc berwind for approximately million in cash  million in acquisition costs and million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of million based on our average closing stock price for the five days preceding the definitive stock purchase agreement with berwind dated june  the purchase terms also provide for caliper to issue berwind an additional million shares if certain financial targets are met 
these targets were not met in  causing  contingent shares to lapse 
if targets are met in  we will be obligated to issue the remaining  contingent shares 
strategy and objectives following the completion of the zymark acquisition  we established the following strategies and objectives continue development of innovative product solutions  using our microfluidic technologies and laboratory automation expertise  to develop key applications in the life sciences industry 
penetrate new markets using our expanded commercial infrastructure and via a shared r d investment model with oem partners 
commercialize new products for drug discovery and development  and genomics and proteomics research 
achieve positive cash flows from operations by the th quarter of increase the percentage of our total revenue from sales of aftermarket sources such as chips  services and annual maintenance contracts to of total revenues by as part of this strategy  we are focused on realizing synergies that we expected from the acquisition by reducing costs  creating a more efficient company  and increasing our sales and marketing focus and adoption of our technologies 
since the completion of the acquisition  we have integrated sales  marketing  manufacturing  service and administration and have conducted two reductions in force to reduce our overall combined expense structure 
we are working on fewer research and development project areas at any given time  enabling us to be more focused  productive and efficient with this investment 
we are also using our combined direct and strategic partnership channels to maximize penetration within the life science research and diagnostics markets 
while these initiatives are providing early positive indications  there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful 
key issues for future performance as our performance unfolds the company must address certain key issues revenues we must grow revenues significantly to meet the company s goal of reaching positive cash flow from operations by the th quarter of improvement in gross margins we need to improve our gross margins by increasing volume  especially in the area of chips  to increase capacity utilization  and by achieving a larger proportion of our sales from higher margin products such as consumable products and services 
cost control it is essential for us to continue to control costs in order to allow an operating cash flow break even point to occur at lower overall revenues 

table of contents we may consider other actions to further control costs  as well as suitable acquisition candidates  over the next several years to help us address these factors 
many of our microfluidic technologies  which we developed prior to our acquisition of zymark in july  are still in the early stages of development  and our drug discovery systems incorporating these technologies have only recently begun to be used commercially 
if our drug discovery systems do not gain further market acceptance  we will be unable to generate significant sales of these products and our revenue may decline 
the commercial success of our drug discovery systems will depend upon capital spending by our potential customers  and market acceptance of the merits of our drug discovery systems by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic research centers and other companies that rely upon laboratory experimentation 
to increase the likelihood that our microfluidic technologies gain market acceptance  a core element of our business strategy is to broaden our network of commercial oem partners in order to access new applications and new markets 
we believe that this will allow us to more effectively leverage the commercial potential of microfluidics in ways that would be difficult to achieve  from both a research investment and infrastructure perspective 
this strategy allows us to combine our proprietary technical expertise with a partner who has complementary capabilities 
these types of collaborations diminish our risk and reduce our costs while leveraging larger  established partners strengths to tap new markets 
as we create new relationships of this type  we expect the financial implications for us to be modest in the early years primarily product development funding until product revenues are generated  beginning generally in the second or third year of a relationship 
even though we experienced significant revenue growth as a result of the zymark acquisition  we believe our revenues during the last two years have been adversely impacted by the sluggish economic climate with its effect of reducing capital spending by pharmaceutical and other research companies 
in the future  we believe that our strategy to expand the proportion of our revenue from higher margin  recurring sources such as labchip products  datapoints generated  and automated disposable dispenser tips  and to continue to expand our base of service business revenues will lessen the potential negative impact of reduced capital spending patterns on our business 
zymark s business has historically experienced a modest level of seasonality in the pattern of sales 
typically  in the second half of the year  the number of customer orders received is greater than those received in the first half of the year 
this trend may not continue  however  given our management s intention to emphasize sources of higher margin  recurring revenues that have the potential to drive greater operational efficiency and less seasonal impact 
customer concentration prior to  we derived our revenues principally from a fee based technology access program model pursuant to which caliper obtained funds from customers in return for such customers early access to caliper s technology 
during  caliper transitioned away from the technology access program model to a commercial product business 
for the year ended december   sales of products accounted for of our revenue and licensing and contract services accounted for of our revenue 
during  amphora alone accounted for of our total revenue and of our product revenue  and agilent alone accounted for of our total revenue and of our product revenue 
with the acquisition of zymark  we expect services will be a more significant source of revenue 
for the year ended december   which included the financial results of zymark after july   sales of products accounted for of our revenue  licensing and contract services accounted for of our revenue  and services accounted for of our revenue 
during the year ended december   agilent  which accounted for of total revenues on a pro forma basis  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and of our product revenues  was our only customer to account for more than of our overall revenues 
amphora  which was no longer considered a related party as of december   accounted for just of our overall revenues during as a result of our expanded commercial revenue base following our acquisition of zymark  we expect ongoing revenues from agilent and amphora to account for a lesser percentage of our overall revenues 

table of contents highlights in addition to the acquisition of zymark  the following highlights and events occurred during and the first part of we terminated our collaboration agreement with agilent on may  in order to gain more flexibility in commercializing new products with other commercial partners  and gain greater ability to market and sell our products in the field of collaborations directly to end users 
due to this termination  we are now operating with agilent under the terms of the collaboration agreement that survived the termination of the agreement  including reciprocal supply agreements set forth in the termination provisions of the agreement 
we entered into a multi year product development and commercialization agreement with bio rad to develop and market a novel microfluidic instrument for worldwide distribution 
we completed a multi year  multi million dollar agreement with affymetrix to automate target preparations for affymetrix proprietary microarray system platforms 
we launched several new products and product extensions that leverage our expertise in commercial product development including labchip drug discovery system  labchip automated electrophoresis system  sciclone inl automated liquid system  and staccato iblox automated workstation we settled the patent infringement lawsuit against molecular devices  which resulted in a nonexclusive license agreement pursuant to which molecular devices paid caliper a one time license fee and will pay royalties on future sales of its imap products 
we expanded our intellectual property portfolio 
caliper was granted or assigned us patents  bringing our us patent count to at december  we also filed new us patent applications  increasing the total number of us patents in prosecution to approximately at year end 
we reorganized our senior management team  including the appointment of a new ceo  in connection with the integration of zymark and caliper  relocated our headquarters to hopkinton  massachusetts  and consolidated all of our instrument manufacturing into our hopkinton  massachusetts manufacturing operation 
we completed several reductions in force to reduce our expenses and closed one of our three facilities in mountain view  california 
we launched the new company name  caliper life sciences  inc  reflecting our unified strategy of focusing on life sciences applications 
we appointed two new board members who contribute significant healthcare business expertise to the board 
we completed a voluntary stock option exchange program initiated in november that allowed employees having stock options with exercise prices per share or lower to exchange for new  lower prices options 
the exchange was completed on may  certain of the key events summarized above are further explained in the discussion that follows 
relationship with agilent technologies in may  we notified agilent of our election to terminate the collaboration agreement between the companies  effective as of may  we established a broad relationship with agilent in may to create a line of commercial research products based on our microfluidic labchip technologies 
in september  agilent introduced our first labchip system for use by individual researchers 
subsequently  agilent and caliper have expanded the application menu for this product and engaged in other new product development activities 
the collaboration agreement provided for agilent to fund our research and development expenditures related to the collaboration  reimburse us for our costs of supplying chips and reagents to agilent and pay us a 
table of contents share of the gross margin earned on all components of labchip systems they sell 
we record revenue from development and support activities under our collaboration agreement in the period in which the costs are incurred 
we report direct costs associated with this contract as research and development expense 
we recognize revenue related to the reimbursement of costs for the supply of chips and reagents to agilent upon shipment and we recognize the related costs as components of cost of sales 
we recognize as revenue our share of gross margin on components of the systems sold by agilent upon shipment to the end user 
under the termination provisions of the collaboration agreement our gross margin share for existing products will remain the same until november in november  our gross margin share for chips and reagents will decrease  and in may our gross margin share for chips and reagents will decrease again 
our gross margin share for sales of the agilent bioanalyzer will also decrease in the same time periods  although at somewhat different rates 
in addition  agilent received a non exclusive license in the field of the collaboration  to caliper s then existing labchip technology as of the date of termination  to develop  manufacture and sell new products in that field 
agilent will be required to pay royalties to caliper based on its net revenue from sales of such products at the established royalty rates set forth in the termination provisions of our collaboration agreement 
as a result of the termination of the collaboration agreement  we are presently only receiving minimal development funding from agilent 
however  it is possible that the parties may decide to collaborate on the development of new commercial research products in the future 
in  we experienced a million decline in contract revenues from agilent  but as further described in results of operations  other new sources of contract revenues  including revenue under our collaboration with bio rad laboratories  helped to more than offset this decline 
effective november  caliper has the right to market and sell collaboration products  with reciprocal supply arrangements with agilent 
our principal motivation in terminating the formal agreement with agilent was to give us more flexibility in commercializing new products with other commercial partners 
termination of the agreement also provides caliper with greater ability to market and sell existing products in the field of the collaboration directly to end user customers  in part utilizing the reciprocal supply arrangements set forth in the termination provisions of the agreement 
both parties will either operate under the existing termination provisions of the collaboration agreement or establish new terms  as yet to be determined 
given the success of the agilent bioanalyzer products and the changing relationship between caliper and agilent  we are actively working to expand the number and scope of our commercial partnerships 
relationship with bio rad laboratories 
in june  caliper and bio rad entered into a multi year product development and commercialization agreement to develop and market a novel microfluidics instrument system for worldwide distribution 
caliper  is contributing its expertise in labchip technologies to automate  integrate and miniaturize multiple experimental steps on a small chip for increased efficiency  ease of use  and higher quality results versus conventional methods 
under the terms of the agreement  caliper will receive research and development funding from bio rad  will be paid royalties on all future sales of instruments and software  and will be the exclusive manufacturer of labchip devices 
relationship with affymetrix 
on january   caliper and affymetrix entered into a multi year collaboration and supply agreement to develop and provide automated target sample preparation instruments for affymetrix commercialized proprietary microarray system and future genechip platforms 
we expect these new automation systems to substantially reduce array processing time  reduce variability and labor costs  and enable researchers to industrialize their genomic research 
the two companies will develop products that leverage caliper s expertise in high throughput automation and microfluidics with affymetrix expertise in microarray technology and applications 
we expect the first products to be launched by late and that they will automate microarray target preparation steps including hybridization  washing and staining 
relationship with amphora discovery corp 
we no longer have a significant ownership interest in amphora 
we initially had a ownership interest in amphora  which was reduced to as of december   and to less than as of december  as a result of equity financings by amphora 
for the period from september  when caliper owned of amphora  through amphora s latest financing in december  we accounted for our interest in amphora under the equity method of accounting 
under this method  which required deferral of our gross profit on sales of drug discovery systems 
table of contents to amphora based upon our ownership level  we recognized the deferred amount as revenue as amphora recorded depreciation on its caliper drug discovery systems 
as of december   since amphora is no longer a related party  we have fully recognized revenue from all prior sales to amphora 
we do not intend to make future equity investments in amphora 
since its inception and through december   amphora has purchased caliper drug discovery systems and million in datapoints 
total revenues from amphora decreased from million in to million in  or 
of the million in total sales   related to drug discovery system products sold prior to amphora is not obligated to make any further datapoint payments to us until they have generated the number of datapoints that amphora is entitled to as a result of the following payments they paid or are required to pay us a million minimum datapoint payment for the months ending november   and b any payments made pursuant to a million deferred contingent obligation through quarterly payments based on amphora s revenue or commissions earned by amphora for marketing assistance 
if amphora generates fewer datapoints than the number to which they are entitled due to the minimum payment and any contingent payments made  our future datapoint revenues will be adversely affected to the extent of this shortfall 
intellectual property 
key to our business strategy has also been the development of an extensive intellectual property portfolio 
consistent with this strategy  we have endeavored to protect our patent portfolio as appropriate 
this resulted in litigation with aclara biosciences  which began in  and with molecular devices  which began in in january  we announced a comprehensive settlement agreement with aclara on all pending litigation between the two companies 
as a result  aclara agreed to pay us million over a three year period in a combination of stock  cash and committed minimum royalties 
during the year ended december   we collected the final million for minimum royalties from aclara 
in november  we settled the patent infringement lawsuit against molecular devices  which resulted in a nonexclusive license agreement pursuant to which molecular devices paid caliper a one time license fee and will pay royalties on future sales of its imap products 
restructuring activities 
since early september of and over the course of the following months  the continuing broad economic slowdown and the adverse impact of reduced research and development spending by biopharmaceutical companies required us to streamline our business to better align our organizational structure with these depressed market conditions and customer demand 
prior to and independent of the zymark acquisition  we conducted two reductions in force as follows in september  we conducted our first reduction in force that resulted in a downsizing of our employee work force by people  primarily in our research and development staff  incurring a restructuring charge of  and in may  we further downsized of our employee workforce by people  again primarily in our research and development staff incurring a restructuring charge of  as a result of the zymark acquisition  we conducted two reductions in force in order to properly size our efforts to the marketplace and increase organizational efficiencies within our newly combined company  and closed one of our facilities  as described below in august  we downsized our newly combined workforce by people with all functional groups affected except for research and development  incurring a restructuring charge of  in december  we downsized our workforce by people  mainly affecting research and development and executive management  incurring a restructuring charge of million 
in december  we recorded a million charge  based upon the estimated net present value of our future lease payments related to the closure of one of our mountain view facilities  net of anticipated sublease rentals  including leasehold improvement write offs and other asset disposals of  related to the building closure 
the facility lease accrual charge involved certain key assumptions including the amount  if any  of any future sublease rentals 
our current assumptions take into consideration the going market rate for leases of similar properties  which is approximately 
table of contents below our current lease 
as such  a decrease in anticipated sublease rentals would not materially affect our estimated liability 
when fully concluded  we estimate the annualized savings of the above reductions in force to be approximately million 
stock option exchange 
on october   we announced that our board of directors approved a voluntary stock option exchange program for employees 
under the exchange program  we offered employees the opportunity to exchange outstanding stock options with exercise prices of per share or lower for new stock options to be granted at an exercise price determined on the date the new stock options were granted 
participating employees received new stock options in exchange for outstanding stock options at an exchange ratio of one for one 
in accordance with the exchange program  on november   we cancelled stock options covering approximately million shares of our common stock 
we granted new options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock on may   the first business day that was six months and one day after the cancellation of the exchanged options 
employees received the same vesting as with their previous options  except that any future vesting of the replacement options was delayed during the exchange period 
in addition  participating employees were prohibited from exercising the replacement options for six months after the date of exchange 
the exercise price per share of the new options is  the fair market value of caliper common stock at the close of regular trading on may  critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses  and assets and liabilities during the periods reported 
we use estimates when accounting for certain items such as warranty expense  sales and marketing programs  employee compensation programs  depreciation and amortization periods  taxes  inventory values  and valuations of investments and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to changing conditions or the validity of our assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize instrument  labchip products  datapoint and service support revenues on shipment or when the related services are performed  as applicable  net of credits and adjustments for discounts 
in instances where we have customers who have requested acceptance provisions  we do not recognize revenue until such customer acceptance has been obtained 
in connection with our adoption of eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  revenue arrangements entered into after july  that include multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the delivered items have stand alone value and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  we allocate the consideration among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and consider the applicable revenue recognition criteria separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
we determine fair value of undelivered items based upon our historic selling prices  or where no historic information exists  based upon management s estimate of the probable selling prices for such undelivered items 
customer and accounts receivables 
we currently have an allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  based on the aging of our accounts receivable balances and our historical experience of defaults and write offs 
we evaluate the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our analysis of factors including accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  changes in customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to further deteriorate  we will need to add to this allowance for doubtful accounts the estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
inventory reserves and write offs 
we make inventory commitment and purchase decisions based upon sales forecasts 
to mitigate the component supply constraints that have existed in the past and to fill 
table of contents orders with non standard configurations  we build inventory levels for certain items with long lead times and enter into certain longer term commitments for certain items 
we reserve for or write off of the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfill future sales estimates 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that we project will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
we generally define excess inventory as inventory in excess of projected usage  which we determine using our best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory levels 
we use a twelve month demand forecast and  in addition to the demand forecast  we also consider parts and subassemblies that can be used in alternative finished products  parts and subassemblies that are unlikely to be engineered out of our products  and known design changes which would reduce our ability to use the inventory as planned 
significant differences between our estimates and judgments regarding future volume and mix of customer demand for our products and actual volume and demand mix may result in additional write offs in the future 
goodwill 
we perform a test for the impairment of goodwill annually following the related acquisition  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
because we have a single operating and reportable business segment  we perform this test by comparing the fair value of the company with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the book value  goodwill is not impaired 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  we would calculate the potential impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the book value 
if the implied goodwill is less than the book value  an impairment charge would be recorded 
impairment 
we review long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we perform the recoverability measurement and estimating of undiscounted cash flows at the lowest possible level for which there are identifiable assets 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate the resulting impairment charge to be recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in december  we recorded an impairment charge of  related to caliper drug discovery instruments carried in property and equipment 
warranty expense 
at the time we recognize revenue  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenue 
our standard warranty period extends months from the date of sale on the automated drug discovery systems and months on chips 
our warranty accrual represents our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty accrual is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what actually transpire in the future 
if our actual warranty costs are greater than the accrual  costs of revenue will increase in the future 
warranty expense was million during restructuring charges 
we established exit plans for each of the restructuring activities which took place in and and accounted for these plans in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  restructuring and impairment 
in accordance with such standards  management makes certain judgmental estimates related to these restructuring charges 
we specifically identified all positions which were to be eliminated and notified the affected employees prior to the end of the quarter in which the related restructuring charge was recorded 
the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates including with respect to contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space being vacated and related costs  and leasehold improvement write downs  offset by estimated sub lease income 
we review on at least a quarterly basis our sub lease assumptions 
these estimates include anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant and the timing of the sub lease arrangement 
if the rental markets change  our sub lease 
table of contents assumptions may not be accurate and changes in these estimates might be necessary and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
for a further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note  restructuring charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  derivatives 
in connection with the adoption of statements of financial accounting standards sfas nos 
and  we recognize derivative financial instruments in the financial statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument 
we recognize changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments either periodically in income or in stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income loss depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting  and if so  whether it is designated as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedge ie  hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk  we recognize the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values 
as of december   we have no derivative financial instruments 
stock options 
we have elected to continue to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock based compensation apb  and its related interpretations  to account for employee stock options because the alternative fair value method of accounting prescribed by sfas no 
requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
under apb  we do not recognize compensation expense because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
we amortize deferred compensation related to stock options  if recorded  using the graded vesting method 
statement of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 requires the disclosure of pro forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share as if we had accounted for its stock options under the fair value method 
if we were to adopt this approach  we would incur significantly higher compensation expenses 
see summary of significant accounting policies note to the financial statements for further discussion 
we account for stock option grants to non employees in accordance with the emerging issues task force consensus no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  which requires the options subject to vesting to be periodically re valued and expensed over their vesting periods 
deferred tax assets 
we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate a significant deferred tax asset 
however  we have recorded a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset as we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to fully utilize the nols 
should our assumptions regarding the utilization of these nols change  we may reduce some or all of this valuation allowance  which would result in the recording of an income tax benefit 
in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions  we accrue charges for possible exposures 
based on the annual evaluations of tax positions  we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted 

table of contents results of operations our financial results for the year ended december  include the financial results of zymark from the date of acquisition  july   through december  revenue year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  change change change change in thousands product revenue service revenue   n a related party revenue license fees and contract revenue total revenue total revenue 
the increase in total revenue in was due almost exclusively to the additional revenues from zymark  offset  in part  by the decrease in related party sales to amphora 
in  total revenues decreased as a result of a significant decline in license and contract revenues after the discontinuation of our technology access program in  offset in part by increased product sales  including related party sales to amphora  and sales to our commercial collaboration partner  agilent 
product revenue 
the increase in product revenue in was due almost exclusively to the revenue added by the acquired zymark products 
the remainder of the product revenue increase resulted from higher revenue from agilent  offset by a net decline in sales of our other products  especially caliper drug discovery system sales 
in  product revenue increased primarily as a result of a increase in revenue from agilent 
sales of our drug discovery products increased overall in  driven by increased datapoint revenues of  which offset a decline in caliper drug discovery system sales and a decline in caliper system revenues  the later due to lack of sizable market demand for this product 
sales of ams products were relatively unchanged in as compared to service revenue 
prior to the acquisition of zymark  we did not have significant service revenue 
the increase in primarily consisted of annual maintenance contracts and support services associated with the installed base of zymark products 
related party revenue 
in  related party revenue from amphora declined primarily due to a decrease in caliper drug discovery system sales 
as of december   amphora was no longer considered a related party as caliper s ownership interest in amphora declined to less than 
in  related party revenue increased primarily due to increases of approximately  in caliper drug discovery system sales  million in datapoint revenues  and  in contracted assay development services 
caliper no longer employs the equity method of accounting for its investment in amphora  and fully recognized  of previously deferred revenues on sales to amphora as of december license fees and contract revenue 
in  license fees and contract revenues increased primarily due to an increase in license fees and contract revenues from non agilent collaborations  including zymark research and development collaborations  and an initial license fee received from molecular devices under a non exclusive license arrangement entered into as a result of a comprehensive settlement of our patent infringement lawsuit against molecular devices in november these sources of revenue were partially offset by a million decline in research and development funding from agilent as we concluded several development programs related to the agilent bioanalyzer product line 
in  license and contract revenue decreased primarily due to a million decrease in contract revenue from our technology access program partners after discontinuance of this program in  a million decrease in license fees from aclara for the ramsey family of patents  a million decrease in agilent contract revenue and a  
table of contents decrease in government contract research revenue 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in application development contract services provided to ams customers 
cost of revenue year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  change change change change in thousands cost of product revenue service revenue related party revenue total cost of revenue cost of product revenue 
in  cost of product revenue increased primarily due to the increase in product revenues generated from sales of zymark products 
in addition  this overall increase included a million write off of excess or obsolete caliper instrument inventory that has been replaced by the labchip drug discovery system  and amortization of  related to the purchase accounting step up of acquired zymark inventories 
following the prioritization of our r d programs  some of our chip manufacturing labor and overhead costs are no longer being utilized for r d programs 
with our increased commercial focus following the zymark acquisition  the idle capacity within chip manufacturing is now classified as cost of product revenues 
this shift in expense increased cost of product revenue by million for the four month period ended december   including million in the fourth quarter of  and we expect will have a similar continuing impact on cost of product revenue in  thereby adversely affecting our product gross margins 
in  cost of product revenue increased primarily due to the increase in agilent product revenue in the agilent case we sell our labchip kits and reagents at cost  and share in the gross margin received by agilent on sales of agilent bioanalyzer instruments and labchip kits and reagents generally  this results in a lower profit margin compared to when we sell our own products directly 
in addition  we incurred  of product warranty cost and wrote off  of excess or obsolete inventory in versus no such cost and writeoffs in as we had only begun to commercialize in profit margins on product revenues were  and respectively in  and the decrease in product gross margin percentage in was caused by several factors including percentage points attributable to the inventory write off and amortization discussed above  percentage points caused by the shift of chip manufacturing costs from r d programs  and the effects of a partial year of zymark included in operating results 
the decrease in product gross margin percentage in was caused by several factors including percentage points attributable to the inventory write off  the percentage points attributable to the increased warranty costs and the remainder primarily due to the increase in lower margin agilent revenues 
cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue in represents costs incurred in relation to providing billable services and supporting installed systems under annual maintenance contracts  including parts replacement and service labor and overhead 
cost of related party revenue 
in  cost of related party revenue decreased as a result of the significant decline in sales of caliper drug discovery system sales to amphora  with revenues in coming primarily from datapoints and non product related sources 
in  cost of related party revenue increased primarily due to warranty costs of  related to installed systems at amphora   related to higher component costs with the remainder driven by product mix due to increased labchip product volume offset by a decline in the number of drug discovery systems purchased in as compared to

in  research and development expenses declined despite the acquisition of zymark which contributed million to our overall ongoing r d expenses  primarily due to our r d prioritization efforts and the associated employee downsizing actions  which are described in restructuring charges below 
in  r d expenses increased due to expanded efforts to increase revenues through the development of new products and applications  including initial labchip development  and activities associated with continuing microfluidic chip development  partner collaborations and product scale up 
we expect research and development spending to decline in as compared to as a result of our downsizing activities in and r d prioritization efforts  only expanding in subsequent years based on customer demand  market conditions and our commercial growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
in  sg a expenses increased primarily due to the additional costs of zymark  offset in part by cost synergies realized through our integration efforts 
in  sg a expenses increased primarily due an increase in employment costs related to our first full year of a marketing and sales function  and general increases in other sg a expenses as a result of our expanded commercial activities 
we expect selling  marketing and product promotion expenses to increase over the next several years to support the more global commercialization of our products through the experienced sales force and commercial infrastructure provided by the acquisition of zymark 
we anticipate general and administrative expenses to increase only as revenue increases  but at a lesser rate 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
deferred stock compensation represents the difference  at the date of grant  between the deemed fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of stock awards including stock options 
during and  we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million 
we are amortizing this amount over the respective vesting periods using the graded vesting method 
in  we recorded deferred compensation of million related to stock awards granted to retain certain key executives and employees in connection with our acquisition and subsequent integration with zymark 
we recorded amortization expense related to deferred stock compensation in and net of reversals of  and million  respectively  of stock compensation expense recognized in previous periods as a result of forfeited options 
of the million of remaining deferred stock compensation included within stockholder s equity as of december   we expect to record amortization of deferred compensation expense of  during and the remaining million during future periods beyond the amount of deferred compensation expense to be recorded in future periods may further decrease if unvested options and restricted stock awards for which deferred compensation has been recorded are subsequently canceled 
restructuring charges 
we recognized restructuring charges in and related to the following a million charge  based upon the estimated net present value of our future lease payments related to the closure of one of our mountain view facilities  net of anticipated sublease rentals  including leasehold improvement write offs and other asset disposals of  related to the building closure 

table of contents the facility lease accrual charge involved certain key assumptions including the amount  if any  of any future sublease rentals 
our current assumptions take into consideration the going market rate for leases of similar properties  which is approximately below our current lease 
as such  a decrease in anticipated sublease rentals would not materially affect our estimated liability 
we recorded total charges of million during for three downsizing actions related to severance and benefits  including  of non cash charges related to acceleration of stock option vesting for certain terminated employees 
two of such reductions in force were completed following our acquisition of zymark  and were principally related to elimination of redundant positions  the relocation of instrument manufacturing to hopkinton  ma  and the prioritization of research and development programs 
these actions resulted in the elimination of positions  including in research and development  in manufacturing operations and service  and in selling  general and administration 
as of december   approximately million of the million remained in accrued restructuring charges  most of which will be paid out through april we recorded a charge of  in september  in response to depressed market conditions and to be better aligned with customer demand

interest income decreased in both and primarily due to lower cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  on average  over the previous years due to cash used in operating and investing activities and  to a lesser extent  the declining interest rate yields occurring each year 
in  interest income was particularly lower due to approximately million of cash used to acquire zymark in july interest expense decreased in both and due to the reduction of our financing obligations 
other income  net 
other income net  consists primarily of mark to market unrealized gains and losses related account balances denominated in another currency  and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments 
other income  net of million in resulted primarily from the effect of realized and unrealized foreign currency gains  offset in part by the disposal of surplus manufacturing equipment no longer needed in our operations 
other income net  in was primarily due to realized gains on marketable securities 
litigation settlement and reimbursement 
in january  we recognized million in a litigation settlement resulting from a comprehensive settlement agreement with aclara for the dismissal of all suits and countersuits between the two companies

royalty obligations to ut batelle  which exceeded certain minimums set forth in the amendment  were  and  in and  respectively 
caliper also has an exclusive license from the trustees of the university of pennsylvania to certain patents relating to microfluidic applications and chip structures 
the minimum royalty obligations under these licenses rise over time  but never exceed  per year 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  acquisitions and other factors 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to expand our support and product development activities  and for other general corporate activities 
based on our long term strategic plan updated for the recent acquisition of zymark  we believe that our current cash balances  together with the revenue to be derived from our commercial partners  our commercial sales from our microfluidic and lab automation products and services will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the year our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  among others continued market acceptance of our microfluidic and lab automation products  continued scientific progress in our microfluidic  lab automation and robotic research and product development programs  the magnitude and scope of our research and product development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  the time and costs involved in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities

we ended with million in total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we have provided financial projections that we expect to attain positive cash flows from operations by the fourth quarter of  and we believe our current cash balances are more than adequate to satisfy our cash needs at least through the end of our actual cash needs could vary considerably  however  depending on opportunities that arise over the course of and during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to reduce our research and development efforts  or sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit arrangements 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the inability to obtain additional financing may force delays in research and product development activities and  ultimately  cause us to cease operations 
financial projections 
we are providing financial projections for the first quarter and full year  and our longer range objectives for generating positive cash flows from operations  as set forth below 
the key financial projections we are providing are as follows we expect full year revenues for to be approximately to million  and first quarter revenues to be approximately to million 
we expect total selling  general and administrative  and research and development expenses to be between and million  incorporating the effects of the shift in r d costs described below 
we expect our gross profit  calculated by subtracting projected cost of product and service revenues from our total projected revenues  to be between and of total revenues  depending significantly on our overall mix of total revenues 
included in cost of revenues are estimated expenses of approximately million per quarter that were previously included in research and development expenses prior to september the change reflects the current utilization of chip manufacturing labor and overhead costs as indirect costs of product revenue  whereas prior to september this production capacity was used to satisfy r d program needs 
we expect to use cash of between million and million during  including an estimated to million to be used for capital expenditures including a new enterprise resource management system to replace our current systems which we deem inadequate to support our expected future growth 
we expect cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to be in excess of million at december  we expect to attain positive cash flows from operations by the fourth quarter of we have incurred operating losses since our inception and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
while we have significantly reduced our research and development expenses  we will continue to make significant investments in r d over the next several years 
we believe that our acquisition of zymark will have the effect of increasing revenues and decreasing our overall net loss in the near terms 
the financial projections that we have provided above forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and are only made as of the date of the filing of this form k 
these projections are based upon assumptions that we have made and believe to be reasonable 
however  actual results may vary significantly from these projections due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business as described in the section entitled factors affecting operating results below

this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either i the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest  or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that the primary beneficiary  as well as all other enterprises with a variable interest in a variable interest entity  make additional disclosures

sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity status 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   otherwise it is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we do not believe there will be a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations from the adoption of the provisions of sfas factors affecting operating results risks related to our business our labchip products may not achieve market acceptance  which could cause our revenue to grow slowly or decline 
many of our microfluidic technologies  which we developed prior to our acquisition of zymark on july   are still in the early stages of development  and our drug discovery and automated electrophoresis systems incorporating these technologies have only recently begun to be used commercially 
if these systems do not gain further market acceptance  we will be unable to generate significant sales of these products and our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline 
the commercial success of our labchip products will depend upon capital spending by our potential customers  and market acceptance of the merits of our drug discovery and automated electrophoresis systems by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic 
table of contents research centers and other companies that rely upon laboratory experimentation 
market acceptance will depend on many factors  including our ability to demonstrate the advantages and potential economic value of our drug discovery systems over alternative well established technologies and labchip products  capital spending by our customers and potential customers  which has been sluggish as a result of current economic conditions and other industry specific factors  and our ability to market our drug discovery systems 
because the labchip products and automated electrophoresis systems have been in operation for only a limited period of time  their accuracy  reliability  ease of use and commercial value have not been fully established 
if the first customers do not endorse our initial drug discovery systems because these systems fail to generate the quantities and quality of data they expect  are too difficult or costly to use  or are otherwise deficient  market acceptance of these drug discovery systems would suffer and further sales may be limited 
we cannot assure you that these customers efforts to put our high throughput systems into use will continue or will be expeditious or effective 
potential customers for our drug discovery systems may also wait for indications from our initial drug discovery system customers that our drug discovery systems work effectively and generate substantial benefits 
further  non acceptance by the market of our initial drug discovery systems could undermine not only those systems but subsequent drug discovery systems as well 
our microfluidic based drug discovery systems are now being marketed and sold principally by the sales and marketing organization we acquired with our recent acquisition of zymark 
these systems and the technologies on which they are based are new to this sales and marketing organization  which may limit our ability to effectively market and sell these systems 
if we are not successful in developing new and enhanced liquid handling and other life sciences products  our products may not gain market acceptance and we may lose market share to our competitors 
the life sciences productivity tools equipment market  the principal market for the traditional products of zymark  is very competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions 
the commercial success of our liquid handling systems and other products depends upon continued and expanding market acceptance of our systems and products by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and genomics research organizations  and upon availability to address quickly any performance problems that our customers encounter 
we anticipate that our competitors will introduce new  enhanced products in this market in the near future 
our future success will depend on our ability to offer new products and technologies that researchers believe are an attractive alternative to current products and technologies  that address the evolving needs of our customers and that are technologically superior to new products that may be offered by our competitors 
we may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts for new products  and we may not ultimately be successful in developing them 
any significant delay in releasing new products in this market could adversely affect our reputation  give a competitor a first to market advantage or cause a competitor to achieve greater market share 
if we do not successfully introduce newer  lower cost versions of our drug discovery systems  and expand the range of applications for these systems  we may experience a decline in revenue or slow revenue growth and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we intend to continue developing new  lower cost versions of our microfluidic based drug discovery systems with enhanced features that address existing or emerging customer needs  such as novel assay functionalities 
if we are unable to do so  our drug discovery systems may not become more widely used and we may experience a decline in revenue or slow revenue growth and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
further  we currently have several assays in development including assays that measure many important activities of cells and proteins 
we are developing line extensions that are particularly well suited for the evaluation of kinases  one of the largest focus areas of drug discovery efforts today 
we are creating new tools to make it easier for our customers to develop their own custom assays in a microfluidic format 
we are also developing kinase profiling and selectivity screening kits 
if we are not able to complete the development of 
table of contents these applications and tools  or if we experience difficulties or delays  we may lose our current customers and may not be able to obtain new customers 
we are subject to the capital spending patterns of the pharmaceutical industry  which over the past several years have been adversely impacted by general economic conditions  industry consolidation and increased competition 
many of our instrument products represent relatively large capital expenditures by our customers 
during the past several years many of our customers and potential customers  particularly in the pharmaceutical industry  have reduced their capital spending budgets because of generally adverse prevailing economic conditions  consolidation in the industry and increased pressure on the profitability of pharmaceutical companies  due in part to more competition from generic drugs 
if our customers and potential customers do not increase their capital spending budgets  because of continuing adverse economic conditions or further consolidation in the industry  we could face weak demand for our products  in particular our products used for high throughput screening 
if the demand for our instrument products is weak because of constrained capital spending by our pharmaceutical industry customers and potential customers  we may not achieve our targets for revenue and cash flow from operations 
our recent acquisition of zymark and other potential acquisitions may have unexpected consequences or impose additional costs on us 
our business is highly competitive and our growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
one of the ways we may address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies  such as our acquisition of zymark 
from time to time  we consider and evaluate potential business combinations both involving our acquisition of another company and transactions involving the sale of caliper through  among other things  a possible merger or consolidation of our business into that of another entity 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential cost and disruptions caused by the integration of financial reporting systems and development of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  accounting consequences  including amortization of acquired intangible assets or other required purchase accounting adjustments  resulting in variability or reductions of our reported earnings  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in these markets have stronger market positions  the potential loss of key employees of caliper or the acquired company due to the employment uncertainties inherent in the acquisition process  the assumption of known and potentially unknown liabilities of the acquired company  we may find that the acquired company or assets do not further our business strategy or that we paid more than what the company or assets are worth  our relationship with current and new employees and customers could be impaired  the acquisition may result in litigation from terminated employees or third parties who believe a claim against us would be valuable to pursue  
table of contents our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture and legal contingencies  among other matters  and insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions 
acquisitions may also cause us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  incur reductions in deferred revenue of the acquired company  resulting in lower future revenues  or incur other large and immediate write offs 
we cannot assure you that our acquisition of zymark and any future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business 
we must also maintain our ability to manage any growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business 
we expect to incur future operating losses and may not achieve profitability 
we have experienced significant operating losses each year since our inception and expect to incur substantial additional operating losses for the years and  primarily as a result of a current sluggish economic climate  dampened life sciences research spending by many of our customers and expected continuing expenses for manufacturing capabilities  research and product development costs and general and administrative costs 
we may never achieve profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development  product marketing and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
these costs have exceeded our interest income and revenue which  to date  have been generated principally from product sales  collaborative research and development agreements  technology access fees  cash and investment balances 
our operating results fluctuate significantly and any failure to meet financial expectations may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and we expect they will continue to fluctuate in the future  even with our combination with zymark  as a result of many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
for example  many of our products represent relatively large capital expenditures for our customers  which leads to variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our products because customers may take several months or longer to evaluate and obtain the necessary internal approvals for the purchase of our products 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales of relatively high priced products  and these sales are generally made by purchase orders and not long term contracts 
delays in receipt of anticipated orders for higher priced products could lead to substantial variability of revenue from quarter to quarter 
furthermore  zymark has historically received purchase orders and shipped a significant portion of each quarter s product orders near the end of the quarter 
if that pattern continues  even short delays in the receipt of orders or shipment of products at the end of a quarter could result in shipment during the next quarter  which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the quarter in which the shipment did not occur 
in addition  zymark s business has historically been affected by capital spending patterns of its customers with a greater percentage of purchases  and therefore higher revenues  occurring in the second half of the year 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
for all of these and other reasons  it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters  our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock may fall abruptly and significantly 
because our revenue and operating results are difficult to predict  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indication of our future performance 

table of contents if revenue declines in a quarter  whether due to a delay in recognizing expected revenue or otherwise  our earnings will decline because many of our expenses are relatively fixed 
in particular  research and development and general and administrative expenses and amortization of deferred stock compensation and intangible assets are not affected directly by variations in revenue 
we have limited experience in manufacturing our products and may encounter manufacturing problems or delays  which could result in lost revenue 
although agilent manufactures the agilent bioanalyzer  we manufacture the chips used in this instrument and also currently manufacture instruments and sipper chips for our drug discovery systems 
we currently have limited manufacturing capacity for our labchip products and automated drug discovery system products and experience variability in manufacturing yields for chips and automated drug discovery products 
if we fail to deliver chips and automated drug discovery products in a timely manner  our relationships with our customers could be seriously harmed  and revenue would decline 
we currently have one manufacturing location for labchip products in mountain view  california  and one manufacturing location for instruments and other products located in hopkinton  massachusetts 
the actual number of chips we are able to sell or use depends in part upon the manufacturing yields for these chips 
we have only recently begun to manufacture significant numbers of sipper chips and are continuing to develop our manufacturing procedures for these chips 
in order to offer sipper chips with more than four capillaries for drug discovery applications  we will need to continue to achieve consistently high yields in this process 
we have experienced difficulties in manufacturing both our chips and instruments 
we cannot assure you that manufacturing or quality problems will not arise as we attempt to scale up our production of chips or that we can scale up manufacturing in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable costs 
if we are unable to consistently manufacture sipper chips or chips for the agilent bioanalyzer on a timely basis because of these or other factors  our product sales will decline 
we are currently manufacturing drug discovery instruments in house and in limited volumes 
if demand for our drug discovery instruments increases significantly  we will either need to expand our in house manufacturing capabilities or outsource to other manufacturers 
our ability to scale up chip manufacturing may be compromised by uncertainty regarding the volume of chips for the agilent bioanalyzer that we will need to supply to agilent in the future 
as our exclusive collaboration with agilent terminated in may pursuant to the notice we delivered to agilent  agilent now has the option to manufacture chips itself rather than continue to receive its supply of chips from caliper 
accordingly  we face uncertainty regarding future demand for these chips from our manufacturing operations 
because a small number of customers and agilent have accounted for  and may continue to account for  a substantial portion of our revenue  our revenue could decline due to the loss of one of these customers or the termination of our agreement with agilent 
historically  we have had very few customers and one commercial partner  agilent  from which we have derived the majority of our revenue 
although our acquisition of zymark in july expanded our customer base  zymark has also historically obtained a significant portion of its revenue from a relatively small number of customers 
during the year ended december   agilent accounted for of total revenues  on a pro forma basis see note to consolidated financial statements  and our next three largest customers collectively accounted for another of total revenues 
accordingly  if we were to lose any one or more of these important customers  our revenue could decrease significantly 
our revenue could decline due to the termination of our agreement with agilent because of a number of different factors  including a reduction in our gross margin share of agilent bioanalyzer and labchip products sold by agilent or reduced sales of such products by agilent due to competition from us or our other commercial partners 
our commercial relationship with agilent is currently in a state of transition due to our termination of the collaboration agreement with agilent  effective in may we are now operating under the surviving provisions of that agreement 
we will continue to receive revenue from agilent based on a formula for gross margin sharing on sales by agilent of instruments and chips developed under our collaboration agreement 

table of contents although we anticipate that future sales of the agilent bioanalyzer system will further expand our revenue base  under the surviving provisions of our agreement with agilent our gross margin share of collaboration products sold by agilent will begin to decline at the end of if sales of these products do not increase fast enough to offset the decline in our gross margin share  the amount of revenue we receive from agilent will decline 
in addition  under the surviving terms of our agreement with agilent  we granted to agilent a non exclusive  royalty bearing license to certain of our labchip technologies existing as of the termination date for agilent to develop  make and sell products in the field of the collaboration 
consequently  there is the possibility that agilent may manufacture its own supply of labchip products  rather than purchasing them from us  or that we may experience competition from agilent in the future  which would reduce our ability to sell products independently or through other commercial partners 
now that our agreement with agilent is terminated  agilent s sales of collaboration products could be reduced due to competition from us or our other commercial partners 
in such event  the revenue we would realize from agilent could be reduced by more than the revenue we receive from other commercial partners 
further  agilent may decide for reasons wholly independent of competition to reduce its sales efforts and or pricing for these products 
if agilent does so  our revenue may decline 
finally  we anticipate research and development funding from agilent to continue to decline in unless we enter into new research and development funding agreements 
if we do not negotiate a new agreement with agilent  we could cease to receive development funding from agilent for new products 
furthermore  the revenue we receive from agilent for existing collaboration products may grow more slowly or decline 
we depend on our key personnel  the loss of whom would impair our ability to compete 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management  especially our chief executive officer  and certain of our scientific staff 
the loss of services of any of these persons could seriously harm our product development and commercialization efforts 
in addition  research  product development and commercialization will require additional skilled personnel in areas such as chemistry and biology  software engineering and electronic engineering 
our business is located in silicon valley  california  and  with the acquisition of zymark  in the boston metropolitan area  where demand for personnel with these skills remains high despite the current economic climate 
as a result  competition for and retention of personnel  particularly for employees with technical expertise  is intense and the turnover rate for these people is high 
if we are unable to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  our ability to conduct and expand our business could be seriously reduced 
the inability to retain and hire qualified personnel could also hinder the planned expansion of our business 
our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and  if we are not successful  could also cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products 
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us 
we may have to pay substantial damages  including treble damages  for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third party s proprietary rights 
further  we may be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license  which  if available at all  may require us to pay substantial royalties 
even if these claims are without merit  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns 
we are aware of third party patents that may relate to our technology or potential products 
we have also been notified that a third party has attempted to provoke an interference with one issued us patent that we have exclusively licensed to determine the priority of inventions 
any public announcements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our stock price to decline 
in  we settled intellectual property litigation with aclara concerning one family of aclara patents 
however  aclara could assert other patent infringement 
table of contents claims against us in the future in alternative dispute resolution proceedings established under our settlement agreement 
we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents  which would be expensive and  if we lose  may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights  which would reduce our ability to compete in the market 
we rely on patents to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position  especially in our microfluidics business 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties  such as the patent infringement suit against molecular devices as described under part i item legal proceedings 
these lawsuits could be expensive  take significant time  and could divert management s attention from other business concerns 
they would put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
we may also provoke these third parties to assert claims against us 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving and  consequently  patent positions in our industry are generally uncertain 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies awarded  if any  will be commercially valuable 
during the course of these suits  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive any of these results to be negative  it could cause our stock price to decline 
the rights we rely upon to protect our intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and would reduce our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products 
if they do not protect our rights  third parties could use our technology  and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 
for a variety of reasons  we may decide not to file for patent  copyright or trademark protection outside of the united states 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights or design around our proprietary technologies 
we are dependent on a single source supplier for the glass used in our labchip products and if we are unable to buy this glass on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver our labchip products to customers 
we currently purchase a key component for our chips from a single source supplier located in germany 
although we keep surplus inventory in our mountain view manufacturing facility  if we are unable to replenish this component on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver our chips to our customers  which would harm our business 
we obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a single source or a limited group of suppliers  and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenue 
we rely on outside vendors to manufacture many components and subassemblies for our products 
certain components  subassemblies and services necessary for the manufacture of our products are provided by a sole supplier or limited group of suppliers  some of which are our competitors 
we currently purchase additional components  such as optical  electronic and pneumatic devices  in configurations specific to our 
table of contents requirements that  together with certain other components  such as computers  are integrated into our products 
we maintain only a limited number of long term supply agreements with our suppliers 
our reliance on a sole or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks  including the following we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of required components  we have reduced control over pricing and the timely delivery of components and subassemblies  and our suppliers may be unable to develop technologically advanced products to support our growth and development of new systems 
because the manufacturing of certain of these components and subassemblies involves complex processes and requires long lead times  we may experience delays or shortages caused by suppliers 
we believe that alternative sources could be obtained at the same prices and on substantially the same terms and conditions  if necessary  for most sole and limited source parts 
however  if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components or subassemblies internally  we might be forced to redesign our systems  which could prevent us from shipping our systems to customers on a timely basis 
some of our suppliers have relatively limited financial and other resources  and  therefore  their businesses could fail 
any inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and subassemblies  or any other circumstance that would restrict our ability to ship our products  could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our business 
if a natural disaster strikes our manufacturing facility we would be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and we would experience lost revenue 
we rely on a single manufacturing location to produce our chips and drug discovery systems  and a single location to produce zymark s laboratory automation and robotics systems  with no alternative facilities 
these facilities and some pieces of manufacturing equipment are difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead time 
our manufacturing facilities may be affected by natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods 
earthquakes are of particular significance since the microfluidic manufacturing facility is located in mountain view  california  an earthquake prone area 
in the event our existing manufacturing facilities or equipment is affected by man made or natural disasters  we would be unable to manufacture products for sale  meet customer demands or sales projections 
if our manufacturing operations were curtailed or ceased  it would harm our business 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenue 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations at least through the year however  we premise this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
our inability to raise needed capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital 
to the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 

table of contents our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may expire if we do not achieve or maintain profitability 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year through if not utilized 
the state net operating losses will begin to expire in year  if not utilized 
utilization of the federal and state net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
because of our lack of earnings history and the uncertainty of realizing these net operating losses  the deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
risks related to owning our common stock our stock price is extremely volatile  and you could lose a substantial portion of your investment 
our stock has been trading on the nasdaq national market only since mid december we initially offered our common stock to the public at per share 
since then our stock price has been extremely volatile and has ranged  through march   from a high of approximately per share on march  to a low of per share both on january  and february  our stock price may drop substantially following an investment in our common stock 
we expect that our stock price will remain volatile as a result of a number of factors  including announcements by analysts regarding their assessment of caliper and its prospects  announcements by our competitors of complementary or competing products and technologies  announcements of our financial results  particularly if they differ from investors expectations  our ability to successfully integrate zymark s and caliper s operations  and general market volatility for technology stocks 
these factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we have been sued  and are at risk of future securities class action litigation 
in the spring and summer of  class action lawsuits were filed against certain leading investment banks and over companies that did public offerings during the prior several years  including lawsuits against caliper and certain of its officers and directors as described under part i item legal proceedings 
this and other securities litigation could result in potential liability  cause us to incur litigation costs and divert management s attention and resources  any of which could harm our business 
in addition  announcements of future lawsuits of this or some other nature  and announcements of events occurring during the course of the current and any future lawsuits  could cause our stock price to drop 
provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover  which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition  merger in which we are not the surviving company or changes in our management 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or 
table of contents more of the outstanding voting stock  from consummating a merger or combination including us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency as a multinational company  we are subject to changes in foreign currency fluctuations 
as our international sales grow  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
the exchange risk is generally related to non dollar intercompany receivables and advances with our european and asian subsidiary operations 
to date  exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our financial results 
interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would not have materially impacted net income or materially affected the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments 
our equipment sale leaseback financings  amounting to million as of december   are all at fixed rates and  therefore  have minimal exposure to changes in interest rates 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities  asset backed securities  and corporate bonds 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objective 
as of december  and  the average remaining maturity of our investment portfolio was approximately year 
all of our instruments are held other than for trading purposes
