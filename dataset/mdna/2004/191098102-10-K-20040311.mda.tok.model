the company had net sales of over billion in overview the following overview provides a summary of key information concerning the company s financial results for fiscal year and changes from fiscal year net income the company reported net income of million or per basic share in compared with net income of million or per basic share in lower interest expense and minority interest expense in offset a million decline in income from operations  resulting in income before income taxes in of million  unchanged from significant favorable income tax expense adjustments in led to an effective tax rate of in versus in significant items which impacted net income net income in was favorably impacted by 
million as a result of changes in certain benefit programs 
the company also recorded several adjustments  primarily resulting from a reduction in the valuation allowance for the company s deferred tax assets as a result of the completion of a state tax audit and a reorganization of the company s subsidiaries  which reduced income tax expense by million 
net income in was favorably impacted by the reversal of an accrual of approximately million related to a retirement benefit payable to j 
frank harrison  jr  the former chairman of the board of directors of the company  who passed away in november as a partial offset  net income was reduced by approximately million due to the termination of two interest rate hedging agreements in the fourth quarter 
operations net sales and gross margin increased by approximately in compared to the prior year 
bottle can volume decreased by approximately while average revenue per case increased by 
the decline in bottle can volume resulted primarily from the introduction of fewer new brands and packaging in than in  certain large customers promoting the company s products less aggressively  difficult economic conditions in certain portions of the company s territories  and unusually cool and wet weather during key holiday periods and summer months 
the soft drink industry has seen a rapid increase in the number of brand and package combinations over the past few years as a result of changing consumer tastes combined with slowing industry wide volume growth rates 
average revenue per case increased in as the company focused on maintaining gross margins while offsetting increases in raw material costs 
the company anticipates further selling price increases in in order to offset a significant projected increase in the cost of aluminum cans and to maintain its gross margins 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses increased only in compared to the prior year despite significant increases in pension expense  fuel costs and property and casualty insurance costs 
over the last two years  the company has converted the majority of its distribution system from a conventional sales method to a pre sell method in which sales personnel either visit or call a customer to determine the customer s requirements for their order 
this pre sell method has enabled the company to add a significant number of new product and package combinations and provides the capacity to add additional product offerings in the future 
in addition  the company closed four sales distribution centers in as part of a multi year effort to reduce overall costs and improve productivity 
the combination of fewer sales distribution centers and the use of the pre sell sales method will enable the company to make its distribution network more efficient over time 
income from operations in declined by million or compared to as modest increases in net sales and gross margin were not sufficient to offset higher s  g a expenses 
interest expense decreased by million or in primarily due to lower average interest rates 
minority interest expense declined by million in due to the purchase by the company of an additional interest in piedmont coca cola bottling partnership piedmont in march financial condition over the past several years  the company has been focused on decreasing financial leverage primarily by reducing its outstanding debt and capital lease obligations 
during  debt and capital lease obligations declined by million despite the purchase of an additional interest in piedmont in march for million 
another key performance indicator the company uses to monitor its financial health is the ratio of income from operations divided by interest expense  which improved from in to in the improvement in this ratio resulted primarily from lower debt balances and a reduction in interest rates 
the company anticipates further reduction in debt and capital lease obligations in basis of presentation the statements of operations  statements of cash flows and the consolidated balance sheets for the years ending december  and december  include the consolidated operations of the company and its majority owned subsidiaries including piedmont 
minority interest consists of the coca cola company s interest in piedmont  which was for the last three quarters of  for the first quarter of and all of and in and prior years 
due to the increase in the company s ownership in piedmont resulting from the additional interest purchased on january   the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of piedmont have been consolidated with those of the company beginning in the first quarter of the company s investment in piedmont had been accounted for using the equity method for and prior years 
generally accepted accounting principles require that results for be presented on an historical basis with the company s investment in piedmont accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
management s discussion and analysis for compared to compares actual results to pro forma results assuming that piedmont had been consolidated in significant events of prior years on june   the company executed a management agreement with south atlantic canners  inc sac  a manufacturing cooperative located in bishopville  south carolina 
the cooperative consists solely of coca cola bottlers 
sac produces bottle and can product for its members 
the company is a member of the cooperative and receives a fee for managing the day to day operations of sac pursuant to a ten year management agreement 
this management agreement expires in may the company anticipates negotiating a new agreement with sac on terms substantially comparable to the current arrangement 
on july   the company and the coca cola company formed piedmont to distribute and market soft drink products of the coca cola company and other third party licensors  primarily in certain portions of north carolina and south carolina 
the company provides a portion of the soft drink products to piedmont and receives a fee for managing the business of piedmont pursuant to a management agreement 
the company and the coca cola company  through their respective subsidiaries  each beneficially owned a interest in piedmont at december  as discussed below  the company has increased its ownership interest in piedmont since december  to and the coca cola company s ownership in piedmont has been reduced to 
acquisitions on january   the company purchased an additional interest in piedmont from the coca cola company for million  increasing the company s ownership in piedmont to

the company recorded million of franchise rights and million related to customer relationships in connection with these acquisitions of additional interests in piedmont 
as of december   the coca cola company owned of the company s outstanding common stock and class b common stock on a combined basis and had a interest in piedmont 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  addressing the recognition and income statement classification of various considerations given by a vendor to a customer 
among its requirements  the consensus requires that certain cash consideration received by a customer from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the price of the vendor s products  and therefore should be characterized as a reduction of cost of sales when recognized in the customer s income statement  unless certain criteria are met 
eitf was effective for the first quarter of previously  the company classified marketing funding support received from the coca cola company and other beverage companies as an adjustment to net sales 
in accordance with eitf  the company began classifying marketing funding support as a reduction of cost of sales in the first quarter the application of eitf did not have a significant impact on results of operations 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities with certain defined characteristics 
application of fin is required in the company s financial statements for interests in variable interest entities that are considered to be special purpose entities for the year ended december  the company has determined that it does not have any arrangements or relationships with special purpose entities 
application of fin for all other types of variable interest entities is required for the company effective march  the company anticipates that application of fin will not have a significant impact on its financial statements at this time 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  that requires additional financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans 
this revised statement replaces existing fasb disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans 
the revised standard requires more disclosure about plan assets  benefit obligations  cash flows  benefit costs and other relevant information 
the company has adopted these disclosure provisions beginning with its year end financial reporting 
discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company has not made changes in any critical accounting policies during the company changed its estimate relating to the realizability of certain income tax assets during the second quarter and third quarter of as discussed below 
any significant changes in critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company during the quarter in which a change is contemplated and prior to making any change 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the company believes will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on the company s recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding 
the company s review of potential bad debts considers the specific industry a particular customer operates in  such as supermarket retailers  convenience stores and mass merchandise retailers  and the general economic conditions that currently exist in that specific industry 
we then consider the effects of concentration of credit risk in a specific industry and for specific customers within that industry 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the company s capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s current estimates 
factors such as changes in the planned use of manufacturing equipment  vending equipment  transportation equipment  warehouse facilities or software could also result in shortened useful lives 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property  plant and equipment should be shortened  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated salvage value over its revised remaining useful life 
the company evaluates long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover an asset s carrying amount  the asset is written down to its fair value and the company recognizes an impairment loss 
franchise rights the company considers franchise rights with the coca cola company and other franchisers to be indefinite lived because the agreements are perpetual or  in situations where agreements are not perpetual  the company anticipates the agreements will continue to be renewed upon expiration 
the cost of renewals is minimal and the company has not had any renewals denied 
the company considers franchise rights as indefinite lived intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
and therefore  does not amortize the value of such assets 
instead  franchise rights are tested at least annually for impairment 
impairment testing of franchise rights and goodwill the only intangible assets the company classifies as indefinite lived are franchise rights and goodwill 
sfas no 
requires testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill for impairment at least annually 
the company completed its annual impairment test for in the third quarter 
for the annual impairment analysis of franchise rights  the fair value for the company s acquired franchise rights is estimated using a multi period excess earnings approach 
this approach involves projecting future earnings  discounting those estimated earnings using an appropriate discount rate and subtracting a contributory charge for net working capital  property  plant and equipment  assembled workforce and customer relationships to arrive at excess earnings attributable to franchise rights 
the present value of the excess earnings attributable to franchise rights is their estimated fair value and is compared to the carrying value on an aggregate basis 
based on this analysis  there was no impairment of our recorded franchise rights in the projection of earnings includes a number of assumptions such as projected net sales  cost of sales  operating expenses and income taxes 
changes in the assumptions required to estimate the present value of the excess earnings attributable to franchise rights could materially impact the fair value estimate 
for the annual impairment analysis of goodwill  the company develops an estimated fair value for the enterprise using an average of three different approaches market value  using the company s stock price plus outstanding debt and minority interest  discounted cash flow analysis  and multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization based upon relevant industry data 
the estimated fair value of the enterprise is then compared to the company s carrying amount including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of the company exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill will be considered not impaired and the second step of the sfas no 
impairment test will not be necessary 
if the carrying amount including goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step of the impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
based on this analysis  there was no impairment of our recorded goodwill in the discounted cash flow analysis includes a number of assumptions such as projected sales volume  net sales  cost of sales and operating expenses 
changes in these assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimate of the enterprise 
deferred tax assets the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of its deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 
a reduction in the valuation allowance and corresponding adjustment to income may be required if the likelihood of realizing existing deferred tax assets were to increase 
the company regularly reviews the realizability of deferred tax assets and initiates a review when significant changes in the company s business occur 
the company s valuation allowance of million at december  relates principally to state net operating loss carryforwards 
during the second and third quarters of  the company adjusted its valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets 
during the second quarter of  the company reduced its valuation allowance upon the completion of a state income tax audit which resulted in a favorable adjustment to income tax expense of million 
during the third quarter of  in conjunction with a reorganization of certain of the company s subsidiaries and corresponding assessment of the company s ability to utilize certain state net operating loss carryforwards  the company reduced its valuation allowance related to such carryforwards 
this reduction in the valuation allowance reduced income tax expense by million in the third quarter 
pension and postretirement benefits obligations the company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all full time nonunion employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  employee turnover  age at retirement and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost recorded by the company in future periods 
in  the discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for the company s nonunion pension plans decreased to from in due to declining interest rates for long term corporate bonds  which serve as the benchmark for determination of the discount rate 
the discount rate assumption is generally the estimate which can have the most significant impact on net periodic pension cost and the projected benefit obligation for these nonunion pension plans 
the company determines an appropriate discount rate annually based on the annual yield on long term corporate bonds as of the measurement date 
a 
increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption at the beginning of fiscal year would have impacted the projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost as follows impact on 
increase 
decrease in thousands projected benefit obligation at december  net periodic pension cost in the weighted average expected long term rate of return of plan assets was reduced from for to for determination of pension expense 
this rate reflects an estimate of long term future returns for the pension plan assets 
this estimate is primarily a function of the asset classes equities versus fixed income in which the pension plan assets are invested and the analysis of past performance of these asset classes over a long period of time 
this analysis includes expected long term inflation and the risk premiums associated with equity and fixed income investments 
the company sponsors a postretirement health care plan for employees meeting specified qualifying criteria 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the net periodic postretirement benefit cost and postretirement benefit obligation for this plan 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate and the expected growth rate for the cost of health care benefits 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected liability under this plan 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
in  the discount rate used in the actuarial estimates for the company s postretirement health care plan decreased to from in due to declining interest rates for long term corporate bonds 
the discount rate assumption  the annual health care cost trend and the ultimate trend rate for health care costs are key estimates which can have a significant impact on the net periodic postretirement benefit cost and postretirement obligation in future periods 
the company annually determines the health care cost trend based on recent actual medical trend experience and projected experience for the following year 
a 
increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption at the beginning of fiscal year would have impacted the projected benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost as follows impact on 
increase 
decrease in thousands postretirement benefit obligation at december  net periodic postretirement benefit cost in a increase or decrease in the annual health care cost trend for would have impacted the postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost as follows impact on increase decrease in thousands postretirement benefit obligation at december  net periodic postretirement benefit cost in on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was enacted 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans 
the postretirement benefit obligation as of december  and the net periodic postretirement benefit cost in do not reflect the effects of the act since enactment occurred after the company s postretirement plan measurement date of september  the company has not determined what  if any  impact the act will have on the company s costs for future postretirement benefits 
results of operations compared to net income the company reported net income of million or per basic share for fiscal year compared with net income of million or per basic share for fiscal year significant items which impacted net income during and are discussed in the overview section 
net sales and gross margin the company s net sales increased approximately in compared to this increase in net sales reflected growth in average revenue per case and contract sales  which more than offset an approximate decline in bottle can volume 
for  average revenue per case increased by compared to some of the factors contributing to the decline in bottle can volume in are discussed below while saw the introduction of numerous new brands and packages  there were not as many new product introductions during brand and package introductions during included sprite remix  ounce pet bottles in fridge pack for future consumption channels and a ml pet bottle package for immediate consumption channels 
new brands and packaging in included vanilla coke  diet vanilla coke  diet cherry coke  fanta flavors  the dasani fridge pack  minute maid lemonade  minute maid pink lemonade and the full rollout of fridge pack cans in all of the company s territories 
new brands and packaging usually stimulate consumer demand resulting in increased sales 
the short term increase in sales from new brands and packages generally exceeds sustained growth as evidenced during some of the company s largest customers are chain grocery stores 
during  certain chain grocery store customers were less aggressive in their promotion of the company s products resulting in volume declines for those customers 
the company believes that some of the volume declines in these chains are offset by higher volume in other retail outlets that more aggressively promoted the company s products 
general economic conditions also impacted the company s results during higher unemployment levels  particularly in certain areas of north carolina  negatively impacted the company s sales channel that includes manufacturing plants  where volume for the year declined 
operating results for were also adversely affected by unusually cool and wet weather throughout much of the company s territory during the key memorial day holiday period  the early weeks of june and most of july and august 
noncarbonated beverages  which include bottled water  juices and isotonics  grew at a much slower rate in than in the past several years and comprised of the company s total sales volume in compared to in contract sales to other coca cola bottlers  which totaled million in  increased by during compared to sales to other bottlers allowed the company to achieve a higher utilization of its production facilities  thus improving overall efficiency of operations 
as previously discussed  the company adopted the provisions of eitf at the beginning of as a result  the company has recorded marketing funding support from the coca cola company and other beverage companies as a reduction in cost of sales 
prior year marketing funding support was reclassified from net sales to cost of sales to conform to the current year presentation 
the company s products are sold and distributed directly by its employees to retail stores and other outlets 
during and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s physical case volume was sold for future consumption 
the remaining and in and  respectively  of the company s volume was sold for immediate consumption through various cold drink outlets 
the company s largest customer wal mart stores  inc accounted for approximately of the company s total sales volume in gross margin increased by in compared to as the increase in average revenue per case more than offset both a decline in bottle can volume and a modest increase in cost of sales on a per unit basis 
gross margin on contract sales to other coca cola bottlers was flat compared to the prior year 
the company s gross margin percentage of in was unchanged compared to the company s gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some entities include all costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales and the company excludes a portion of these costs from gross margin  including them instead in s  g a expenses 
cost of sales and operating expenses cost of sales on a per unit basis increased for compared to the increase in cost of sales on a per unit basis resulted primarily from modest increases in raw material costs 
cost of sales includes the following raw material costs  manufacturing labor  manufacturing overhead  inbound freight charges related to raw materials  receiving costs  inspection costs  manufacturing warehousing costs and freight charges related to the movement of finished goods from manufacturing locations to sales distribution centers 
the company anticipates that the cost of aluminum cans will increase significantly in as compared to prior years 
as a result  the company is focused on managing its selling prices in in order to offset higher raw material costs and to maintain its gross margins 
during  the company and all other coca cola bottlers in the us formed coca cola bottling sales and services company ccbss for the purpose of facilitating various procurement functions and distributing certain specified beverage products of the coca cola company 
ccbss is responsible for negotiating contracts for most of the significant raw materials other than concentrates and syrups purchased by the company 
the company anticipates that in future years ccbss will increase purchasing efficiency for coca cola bottlers and help reduce future increases in cost of sales 
the company relies extensively on advertising and sales promotion in the marketing of its products 
the coca cola company and other beverage companies that supply concentrates  syrups and finished products to the company make substantial marketing and advertising expenditures to promote sales in the local territories served by the company 
the company also benefits from national advertising programs conducted by the coca cola company and other beverage companies 
certain of the marketing expenditures by the coca cola company and other beverage companies are made pursuant to annual arrangements 
although the coca cola company has advised the company that it intends to provide marketing funding support in  it is not obligated to do so under the company s bottle contracts 
significant decreases in marketing funding support from the coca cola company or other beverage companies could adversely impact operating results of the company 
total marketing funding support from the coca cola company and other beverage companies  which includes direct payments to the company  payments to customers for marketing programs and the strategic growth initiative sgi payments  was million in versus million in and was recorded as a reduction in cost of sales

the company recorded million and million as a reduction in cost of sales related to sgi during and  respectively 
in  the company could have received a total of million in cash in incremental marketing funding support under sgi as a result of its volume performance 
instead  the company requested the coca cola company reinvest million of this funding in additional local media and the balance of the funding  or million  was received by the company in cash 
s  g a expenses for increased by compared to the prior year
