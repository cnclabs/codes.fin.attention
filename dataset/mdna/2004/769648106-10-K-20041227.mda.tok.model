critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s financial statements 
these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity include revenue recognition using percentage of completion estimates and the assessment of asset impairments 
the company uses the following methods and assumptions in its estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on time and material contracts utilizing the completed contract method 
revenue is recognized on all other contracts utilizing the percentage of completion method 
under the completed contract method  the contract is considered complete when all costs except for insignificant items have been incurred and has been approved by the customer 
under the percentage of completion method  estimated contract earnings are based on total estimated contract profits multiplied by the ratio of labor hours incurred to total estimated labor hours on the contract 
provisions for total estimated losses on contracts in process are recognized in the period such losses are determined 
changes in job performance  conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period such revisions are determined 
net book value of long lived assets the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets held and used 
this review is performed using estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount that the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value

basis of presentation the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
during  the company sustained a loss from operations of  and a net loss of  this loss resulted in an accumulated deficit of  as of august  further  the company was not in compliance with the covenants of its long term loan agreement causing the company s debt to be classified as current in the financial statements 
the company s agreement was extended to december  the company is currently negotiating a three month extension of such agreement 
these factors  among other things  raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
the company believes that the revolving line of credit and the funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to cover anticipated cash needs through fiscal however  depending on company s primary lenders willingness to extend the due date of the facility as well as the level of future sales  terms of such sales  financial performance and cash flow of existing contracts  such financing may not be sufficient to support operations 
therefore  the company may be required to seek additional sources of funding 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value may not be recoverable 
an asset is deemed impaired and written down to its fair value if estimated related total future undiscounted cash flows are less than its book carrying value 
the company  in performing its evaluation of long lived assets for impairment  utilized financial projections for five future years including total undiscounted cash flow 
in developing the projections  the company estimated revenues for each year and estimated resulting margins based upon various assumptions including future market pricing trends and historical financial costs 
the analysis concluded that the estimated total undiscounted future cash flows were in excess of the carrying value of long lived assets 
had the analysis concluded that the total undiscounted future cash flows been below the carrying value  an impairment charge of the difference between the carrying value and the lower of the total discounted cash flows or fair value would have been recorded 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue 
total revenue decreased from approximately million in to million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was a result of the company completing its significant tooling programs for a major european automaker for a sports utility vehicle and a new crossover vehicle to be manufactured in the united states 
the company s customer for these vehicles is the tier supplier to mercedes benz for these particular vehicles 
during the fourth quarter  the company had significant difficulties in completing the contracts  which had a severe negative effect on revenue  cost of sales  and related earnings 
the company  due to many various circumstances  incurred significant cost overruns on many of the parts under the contracts 
many of these cost overruns involve customer timing changes  material specification changes and the company outsourcing the completion of many dies to meet customer deadlines 
all of the aforementioned issues resulted in the company incurring approximately million in additional outsourcing costs and million in additional labor costs 
the company has accrued million of estimated losses on these contracts and others as of august   and believes this reserve will be adequate to complete the contracts 
the outsourcing costs were incurred as a result of the company having certain bottlenecks in its production 
these bottlenecks were a result of changes to material specifications combined with an increase in the number of engineering changes required 
the material specification changes involved customer changes from a grade of steel the company had previous experience with to a new grade of high strength steel which  not only had the company had no experience working with  was also new to the customer 
as a result of this new material  the company could not simulate the flow of the steel in the dies 
due to the lack of historical data as to the material flow  the company  in some cases  had to re cut the dies up to eight times to get the part within specifications with this material 
this created capacity constraints in the company s machining and tryout areas 
as a result of these constraints  the customer required that the company utilize specified outside die shops to complete certain dies  which were constructed internally 
the customer decided that the company s internal capacity had become overburdened as a result of the rework being performed by the company to obtain part specifications with the new high strength steel 
had the company not outsourced this work  the customer may have cancelled the contracts and charged the company for all of the added costs incurred 
in addition  the customer may have discontinued the scheduled progress payments  which would have caused severe cash flow problems for the company 
management took the position that by outsourcing this work directly the added costs were better controlled and prevented potential cash flow difficulties

as a result the company has negotiated a million revolving line of credit with a balance outstanding of approximately million as of december   and term notes with an aggregate outstanding balance of  expiring december  the revolving line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus percent an effective rate of at november  and the term notes bears interest at bank s prime rate plus percent an effective rate of at november  
the company also has two subordinated debt notes payable totaling  which includes  bearing interest at and  bearing interest at plus deferred interest of 
the table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of august less than more than total year years years years debt   operating lease      deferred compensation      capital lease     total obligations      the company believes that the revolving line of credit and the funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to cover anticipated cash needs through fiscal however  depending on company s primary lenders willingness to extend the due date of the facility as well as the level of future sales  terms of such sales  financial performance and cash flow of existing contracts  such financing may not be sufficient to support operations 
therefore  the company may be required to seek additional sources of funding 
inflation the company has no long term  fixed price supply contracts 
although the average set of dies takes approximately ten months from inception to shipment  any significant direct material costs are incurred at the beginning of the die manufacturing process 
historically  the company has been able to reflect increases in the prices of labor and material in its selling prices  however under current industry pricing pressures  the company is unsure if this will continue to be the case in the future
