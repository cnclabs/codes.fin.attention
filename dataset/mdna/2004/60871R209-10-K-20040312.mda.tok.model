item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary overall  was a difficult year for us  especially in the us we faced extremely soft industry demand throughout the year in the us  and  although we made significant progress in key areas of our business  our americas segment profits came in only slightly above our prior year results 
the us beer industry faced many challenges in  including continued weakness in the us economy during and  specifically  high unemployment levels among the key year old male consumer population  unfavorable weather  particularly in the northeast  for a significant part of the peak summer selling season  the popularity of low carbohydrate diets that softened demand for beer  the rise in popularity of distilled spirits and other alternative beverages  particularly among year olds  and a protracted grocery store strike in california that likely impacted sales in the largest beer state 
two additional issues were unique to our us business during first  we did not offer a product with low carbohydrate positioning 
second  late in the year  when most of the industry was showing signs of recovery  we experienced significant product supply problems that left us unable to meet all the needs of our wholesale and retail customers 
we are addressing these issues early in in order to optimize our supply chain systems capabilities 
our performance in the europe segment  specifically in the uk  reflected strong volume and market share growth 
results were negatively impacted by the lack of benefits in from revenue producing transitional activities which occurred in following our acquisition of the uk business  as well as high levels of discounting in the off trade channel during the first two thirds of the year 
later in the year  however  our performance in the uk showed the positive profit impact of our strong volume growth  reduced off trade discounting levels  and productivity improvements from supply chain initiatives 
one critical area of accomplishment in was our cash generation and debt reduction 
full year debt repayments totaled million  more than greater than the million we repaid in cash flow during the year benefited from higher operating cash flow  a temporary reduction in cash taxes  improvements in working capital  and continually improving capital spending disciplines in the us those are the key highlights for looking forward  we have four major strategies we re focused on to succeed in the global beer industry first  we are striving to capture an increasing share of each new generation of legal drinking age beer drinkers in order to gain their brand loyalty for the long term 
we intend to accomplish this by building our big brands in big markets coors light in the americas  carling and grolsch in the uk which are the young adult beer drinker s point of entry into our portfolio 
to achieve this goal  we continued during to refine our sales and marketing initiatives supporting our flagship brands 
as a result  volume momentum in the uk behind carling and grolsch has been outstanding 
in canada  coors light has continued to grow volume and market share 
despite a poor volume year in the us  we ve made progress among key demographics and retail channels  and we are taking steps to make all of our initiatives even more effective 
second  we intend to capture more than our fair share of the product news opportunities in the category each year through both new products and brands  or product developments with existing brands  such as coors light and carling 
in march  we launched aspen edge our entry in the low carb segment here in the us 
we are also repositioning zima in the us  continuing to expand carling extra cold in the uk  and launching our coors fine light beer in the uk 
third  we need to strengthen our access to retail by building the capabilities that are key to partnering and being successful with our wholesalers and retailers 
our biggest investment to strengthen our access to retail in was the initiative to improve our americas supply chain systems and processes 
making these investments was a necessity for the long term success of our business 
our start up problems were greater than expected  but in early  product supply has improved as wholesale and retail stock outs are now a fraction of what they were in our most difficult period early in the fourth quarter of when the capabilities of our new supply chain systems and processes are more fully optimized later this year  our distributors will have more control over their orders  better visibility throughout the shipping process  and better service  which we anticipate will result in efficiencies and cost savings for us and for our distributors 
fourth  we need to lower our cost structure so that we can grow profits and afford the investments needed to grow and succeed 
in we made significant progress in both the americas and europe 
productivity from operations in the us was solid in  despite soft volume 
in the uk  we right sized our production assets in  and we expect to see the benefits in we believe these four strategies represent the right business model for succeeding in our current environment 
despite our results and the challenges ahead  we have made significant progress in key areas of our business that make us optimistic about our future prospects 
results of operations our consolidated results are driven by the results of our two operating segments  americas and europe  and our unallocated corporate expenses 
when comparing to  note that we only include cbl results since february   the date of acquisition  thus excluding cbl s january results 
consolidated income before income taxes decreased in compared to our consolidated volume increased from million barrels to million barrels 
these results were driven by improved performance in the second half of the year in our major businesses outside the united states  including europe  canada  and the caribbean 
our business was also helped by favorable foreign exchange rates  better margins  and improved uk operations productivity 
however  offsetting these positive factors  our us business suffered from soft industry demand throughout the year  increased popularity of beers with low carbohydrate positioning  and our product supply disruptions related to implementation of our new supply chain systems and processes late in the year 
our effective tax rate in at was significantly lower than our tax rate in at 
the lower rate was primarily the result of the favorable completion of tax audits for the years through and benefits realized from the tax structure related to the acquisition of our uk business 
this lower tax rate is directly responsible for net income and earnings per share increasing in from the prior year 
from to  consolidated income before taxes increased significantly  primarily as a result of our acquisition of cbl on february  from to  our net sales and income before income taxes increased and  respectively  as a result of the additional business 
we also experienced a significant increase in interest expense  from million to million  during as a result of debt incurred to acquire the cbl business 
we achieved an increase from million barrels to million barrels of beverages  an increase of 
our americas business reported a modest increase in income before income taxes and basically flat volume from to these results are expanded upon in the americas segment discussion that follows 
our consolidated effective tax rate was in  down from for the decrease was driven by the benefits realized from our uk business 
americas segment the americas segment is focused on the production  marketing and sales of the coors portfolio of brands in the united states and its territories 
this segment also includes the coors light business in canada that is conducted through a partnership investment with molson  coors canada  and the sale of molson products in the united states that is conducted through a joint venture investment  molson usa 
the americas segment also includes the small amount of volume that is sold outside of the united states and its territories and europe

gain from the sale of company owned distributorships consists primarily of equity share of molson usa losses and gains from sales of water rights and warehouses 
n m not meaningful foreign currency impact on results in  our americas segment benefited from a year over year increase in the value of the canadian dollar cad against the us dollar 
as a result of this exchange rate fluctuation  net sales  operating income  and income before taxes are higher than in the prior year by approximately million 
net sales and volume net sales for the americas segment increased slightly from to on a per barrel basis  net sales increased while volume decreased year over year 
net sales were impacted positively by continued favorable pricing in the united states  as well as significant growth in our canadian business 
likewise  net sales were impacted positively by a one time million increase in revenue during the first quarter that resulted from the settlement of a contract interpretation dispute between cbc and one of our wholesalers 
however  we experienced challenges in our americas segment as our volume was impacted negatively by a weak industry demand throughout the year caused by a very wet summer in the northeast and a sluggish economy 
in addition  we were negatively impacted by a mix shift toward lower revenue per barrel brands such as keystone light  which experienced a volume growth of 
growing consumer interest in low carbohydrate food and beverage products hurt sales for coors light and other premium light beers that did not have low carbohydrate positioning 
as a result of this change in consumer tastes and the mix shift away from premium products  coors light sales volume declined in we also experienced significant challenges in the fourth quarter of when we implemented new supply chain systems and processes 
due to a difficult start up early in the fourth quarter  we were unable to ship sufficient quantities of beer in some brand and package configurations 
while our supply chain improved by the end of the year  the supply disruptions caused by this implementation had a meaningful negative impact on volume and earnings 
our net sales decreased from  while volume for the americas segment remained relatively flat 
net revenue per barrel declined from the declines were mostly due to the sale of company owned distributorships in whose volumes were included in results until the date of sale  a decline in volume in puerto rico as a result of a increase in a beer excise tax that took effect during the summer of  and a negative sales mix in the united states where consumer preferences moved toward our lower revenue per barrel brands  geographies  and packages 
partially offsetting these declines in sales and volume was improved domestic pricing and reduced price promotions 
from a brand perspective  growth in domestic coors light and keystone light brands in versus were partially offset by declines in zima  killian s and exported coors light 
zima was impacted disproportionately by the influx of new flavored alcohol beverages fabs in the united states during much of cost of goods sold and gross profit americas cost of goods sold increased approximately per barrel in versus the overall increase in cost of goods sold per barrel in was the result of higher depreciation costs stemming from recent additions to fixed assets  higher pension and other labor related costs  increased fuel costs  and the de leveraging of fixed costs resulting from the decline in volume 
our higher pension costs were the result of the unfavorable impacts of lower returns on pension assets in recent years and lower discount rates 
in addition to these more pervasive factors  we incurred approximately million of increased costs in the fourth quarter of  primarily related to extra freight  direct labor and finished goods loss associated with our new supply chain processes and systems implementation 
these costs were in addition to the impacts from decreased volume 
however  our controllable operations costs  which make up about of our americas cost of goods sold  declined slightly per barrel during the year as a result of operations efficiency initiatives and improved packaging costs 
compared to  our gross profit increased  or on a per barrel basis 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased by nearly 
increases were driven primarily by price increases and improved operations efficiencies and lower packaging costs 
in  we experienced a decrease in cost of goods sold 
on a per barrel basis  the decline was 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold was approximately in compared to in these decreases are attributable primarily to the sale of company owned distributorships in  lower transportation and packaging costs and continued operations efficiency initiatives in our breweries 
offsetting these decreases were higher costs associated with adding capacity to our golden and memphis manufacturing facilities and bottle packaging capacity in shenandoah  virginia 
we also incurred higher pension and other labor related costs 
our gross profit increased in over as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased nearly 
increases were driven by the decline in cost of goods sold 
marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative expenses increased  or on a per barrel basis  in compared to this increase was driven by higher costs for employee benefits  primarily pension costs  and higher spending levels related to information technology 
selling and marketing expense was also slightly higher year over year 
in  marketing  general and administrative expenses increased over the previous year  driven by higher marketing expense as we invested more behind our brands in advertising and sales promotion  higher systems investments and labor related costs 
partially offset by this increase in selling and marketing expense was a decline in general and administrative expense due to the sale of company owned distributorships in europe segment the europe segment consists of our production and sale of the cbl brands  principally in the united kingdom but also in other parts of the world  our joint venture arrangement relating to the production and distribution of grolsch in the united kingdom and republic of ireland  and our joint venture arrangement for the physical distribution of products throughout great britain tradeteam 
it also includes the sale of coors fine light in the united kingdom and coors light in the republic of ireland

accordingly  the historical europe segment results include only our pre acquisition europe operation  which generated very small volume and revenue 
our discussion on the comparative results of the europe segment from to has been excluded  as comparative results are not meaningful 
other income  net was composed primarily of tradeteam income included in cost of goods sold in  offset by leasehold expenses and losses on asset sales see item  note 
in  other income  net primarily related to income from a small investment in an internet marketing venture in the uk 
n m not meaningful foreign currency impact on results in  our europe segment benefited from an year over year increase in the value of the british pound sterling gbp against the us dollar  partially as a result of this exchange rate fluctuation  all results from our europe segment in are significantly higher than in the prior year 
the following table summarizes the approximate effect this change in exchange rate had on the europe results in increase due to currency effects in thousands net sales us cost of goods sold gross profit marketing  general administrative operating income interest income other income  net income before income taxes net sales and volume net sales for the europe segment increased in  while volume increased from the previous year 
the significant increase in net sales and volume was partly due to our owning the cbl business for the full year in versus forty seven weeks in of the sales increase represents the effect of currency exchange rates 
on a full year comparative basis  our sales volumes increased 
this growth was driven by the carling and grolsch brands  both of which grew volume by more than during the year 
our on trade business  which represents approximately two thirds of our europe volume and an even greater portion of margin  grew volume by approximately compared to the full year as a result of strong sales execution  particularly with carling and carling extra cold  and unusually hot weather in the united kingdom this summer 
in a declining on trade market  this yielded a market share gain of approximately percentage points 
our off trade volume for increased approximately over the comparable period in  led by carling and grolsch 
contributing factors to this volume growth were the favorable summer weather and aggressive discounting  primarily in the first half of the year 
our off trade market share growth for the year was approximately 
our positive volume in both the on and off trade and positive pricing in the on trade were partially offset by a decline in our on trade factored brand sales and  in the off trade  heavy price discounting and mix shift toward lower revenue per barrel sales 
the decline in sales of factored brands in the on trade was driven by some of our large on trade chain customers changing to purchase non coors products directly from the brand owners 
cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold increased in versus on a per barrel basis  cost of goods sold increased 
the aggregate increase in cost of goods sold was driven by increased volume and higher foreign exchange rates  coupled with our owning the business for the full year versus only a partial period in also driving this increase  and the increase in the per barrel cost  was the reclassification of tradeteam earnings from cost of goods sold to other income beginning in and the loss of income from contract brewing arrangements that substantially ceased near the end of additionally  during the first three quarters of  we incurred higher production costs as we contracted with regional brewers to package some of our off trade volume while we were commissioning the new and upgraded packing lines in our burton brewery 
we were able to realize some benefit from right sizing and improving our uk production infrastructure towards the latter half of the year  which partially offset the increases noted above 
the increases in cost of goods sold were also reduced by the decrease in factored brand volume where the purchase cost is included in our cost of goods sold  but the related volume is not included in reported volumes 
gross profit in the europe segment increased  however  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  gross profit was essentially flat despite the inclusion of a full year of sales in gross profit per barrel decreased and gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased during as a result of the reclassification of tradeteam earnings and our contract packaging costs incurred as we commissioned the packaging lines in burton 
marketing  general and administrative expenses europe marketing  general and administrative expenses increased during almost entirely due to exchange rates and the impact of the full year of ownership 
on a per barrel basis  marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased year over year 
various factors impacted marketing  general and administrative expense during  which effectively off set each other a we had higher investments in sales staff and increased depreciation charges from investments in information systems and dispense equipment  the latter supporting the sales growth in the on trade  b we were impacted by the loss of reimbursements from the transitional services arrangements with interbrew sa that were set up following the cbl acquisition in february and largely concluded by the end of that year 
these reimbursements were recorded as a reduction to marketing  general and administrative expenses in  c we realized savings in employee bonus costs and directors costs  and d the one time gain of million before tax on the sale of the rights to our hooper s hooch fab brand in russia during the third quarter 
interest income interest income is earned on trade loans to uk on trade customers 
interest income increased in as a result of favorable foreign exchange rates  the inclusion of an additional five weeks of results in and a lower debt balance in corporate corporate currently includes interest expense and certain other general and administrative costs that are not allocable to either the americas or europe operating segments 
corporate contains no sales or cost of goods sold 
in  we changed our allocation methodology between the americas and europe segments for general and administrative expenses  leaving certain of these costs in corporate 
the and amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation 
the majority of these corporate costs relates to worldwide finance and administrative functions  such as corporate affairs  legal  human resources  insurance and risk management 
fiscal year ended december  percent change december  percent change december  in thousands  except percentages net sales cost of goods sold gross profit marketing  general and administrative expenses special charges n m n m operating loss n m interest income interest expense n m other income  net loss before income taxes n m relate primarily to acquisition costs for cbl  including accounting  appraisal and legal fees not eligible for capitalization

n m not meaningful marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative expenses for corporate increased in compared to due to increased pension and benefit costs and management of a larger global business 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased significantly from for the same reasons 
interest income interest income for decreased million because of lower interest rates and lower cash balances in over interest income decreased million from to due to higher cash and interest bearing securities balances in we sold all of our interest bearing securities in january to help fund the acquisition of cbl 
interest expense interest expense increased million in this increase was driven by having our fixed rate debt structure in place for the full year in versus only eight months in and the currency appreciation on our gbp denominated term debt prior to its payoff in august prior to finalizing the long term structure in second quarter of  we had exclusively short term borrowings at lower interest rates that supported our acquisition of cbl in february the increase is also due to our cross currency swap structure and our gbp denominated interest expense 
partially offsetting these factors was the implementation of our lower interest rate commercial paper program in june  the initial proceeds of which we used to pay down approximately million of higher rate gbp denominated term debt 
our new debt structure has lower interest costs on outstanding balances 
interest expense increased million versus due to the significant increase in debt incurred to purchase cbl early that year 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external borrowings 
as of december   including cash and short term borrowings  we had negative working capital of million compared to negative working capital of million at december  we are able to operate with a negative working capital investment because of relatively short terms on receivables in our americas segment and our ability to carry low levels of finished goods inventories as a result of the structure of our distribution system 
these factors are offset by higher investments in working capital in europe  primarily with regard to accounts receivable 
the increase in our working capital is the net result of changes in our short term borrowings  accrued expenses and other liabilities  accounts and notes receivable and raw materials 
at december   cash and short term marketable securities totaled million  compared to million at december  our cash and short term marketable securities balances decreased primarily due to early payments of principal and interest on our long term debt made late in our fiscal year we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term borrowings  when necessary  will be quite sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements  scheduled principal and interest payments on debt  dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products  which could arise from competitive circumstances  a decline in the acceptability of alcohol beverages  any shift away from light beers and any of the other factors we describe in the section titled risk factors 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to supplement our operating cash flow through potential monetizations of assets 
success in accomplishing these efforts will result in faster reduction of outstanding debt 
we also have credit facilities that contain financial and operating covenants  and provide for scheduled repayments  that could impact our liquidity on an ongoing basis 
during the fiscal year ended december   we made debt repayments of approximately million 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million in compared to the increase was attributable primarily to cash provided by trade receivables and payables in the result of continued emphasis on working capital management by improving receivable collection in the uk and managing the purchasing cycle throughout the company 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million in  compared to the change was attributable primarily to the acquisition of cbl  which added to our depreciation and amortization and modified the composition of our working capital in investing activities during the fiscal year ended december   we used net cash of million in investing activities  compared to billion used in the decrease in net cash used is due to the billion payment  net of cash acquired  made to purchase cbl in however  excluding our billion payment to acquire cbl  total cash used in investing activities increased approximately million compared to the same period last year  mainly due to the absence of sales and maturities of investments in versus a significant amount of investments was sold in to help fund the acquisition of cbl 
net cash used in investing activities increased billion from to the increase was due to the cash used in the acquisition of cbl 
also  in  we made a payment of million for our interest in molson usa 
however  excluding these payments  total cash provided by investing activities increased approximately million year over year mostly due to a substantial decrease in purchases of securities 
as a result of our debt burden associated with the cbl acquisition  we did not purchase any marketable securities in compared to purchases of million during financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  representing a billion decrease from cash provided by financing activities in this decrease is primarily attributable to the billion proceeds from issuance of debt in  partially offset by larger payments on debt and capital lease obligations in debt related activity in reflected net payments of long and short term debt totaling million whereas in  debt related activity reflected a net increase in long and short term debt of billion  due primarily to borrowings related to our acquisition of cbl 
repayments of long term debt during totaled million  the remaining change in financing activities relates to temporary changes in short term borrowings 
in  net cash provided by financing activities increased billion from the previous year as a result of debt proceeds and payments associated with our acquisition of cbl 
excluding these items  change in financing activities was driven by changes in overdraft balances and the absence of treasury stock purchases in versus purchases of million in debt structure our total borrowings as of december   were composed of the following as of description december  december  in thousands short term borrowings senior private placement notes senior notes due senior credit facility usd amortizing term loan gbp amortizing term loan commercial paper other total long term debt including current portion less current portion of long term debt total long term debt the aggregate principal debt maturities of long term debt for the next five fiscal years are as follows amount in thousands thereafter total we incurred significant debt in to finance the purchase of cbl 
since the acquisition  we have used cash from operating activities and from asset monetizations  net of capital expenditures and other cash used in investing activities  to make payments on our debt obligations 
in june  we issued approximately million of commercial paper  approximately million of which was outstanding at december  million of our commercial paper balance is classified as long term  reflecting our intent to keep this amount outstanding for longer than days and our ability to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis through our revolving line of credit 
the remaining million is classified as short term  as our intent is to repay that portion in the next twelve months 
concurrent with our issuance of commercial paper  we made a payment against the then outstanding principal and interest on our gbp denominated amortizing term loan of approximately million gbp million at then prevailing foreign currency exchange rates using proceeds from our issuance of commercial paper 
we repaid the balance of our gbp term loan in the third quarter of using cash generated from operations 
we also repaid million of our us dollar usd denominated term loan in the fourth quarter 
in conjunction with these payments  we accelerated our amortization of loan fees  resulting in a charge of million to interest expense during the year
