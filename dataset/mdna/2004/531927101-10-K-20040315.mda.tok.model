item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of operations and financial condition of lifecell should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of see business special note regarding forward looking statements and business risk factors 
in the following discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid the presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
general and background we develop and market products made from human allograft tissue for use in reconstructive  urogynecologic and orthopedic surgical procedures 
our patented tissue processing technology produces a unique regenerative tissue matrix a complex three dimensional structure that contains proteins  growth factor binding sites and vascular channels that provides a complete template for the regeneration of normal human tissue 
we currently market a broad range of products alloderm  regenerative tissue matrix for reconstructive surgical procedures and skin grafting for burn procedures through our direct sales organization and for periodontal surgery through biohorizons  inc  cymetra  a version of alloderm in particulate form  through our direct sales organization  repliform  regenerative tissue matrix for urogynecologic procedures  through a marketing agreement with boston scientific corporation  graft jacket  regenerative tissue matrix for orthopedic applications  through a distribution agreement with wright medical technology  inc  and allocraft dbm  regenerative tissue matrix for bone grafting  through a marketing agreement with stryker corporation 
our product development programs include the application of our tissue matrix technology to vascular and orthopedic tissue repair  investigation of human tissues as carriers for therapeutics  thrombosol  a formulation for extended storage of platelets and technologies to enhance the storage of red blood cells for transfusion 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to the understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these polices requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the valuation of assets and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  including the impact of recent accounting pronouncements  see note in the notes to the financial statements in part iv  item 
of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for product sales when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
we utilize independent sales and marketing agents to supplement our direct sales organization 
for products marketed through our independent sales and marketing agents we recognize revenue when the products are delivered to the third party customer  as this is when title and risk of loss to the product transfers 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue at the time the related product revenue is recognized 
research grant revenues are recognized at the time qualified expenses are incurred  unless we have continuing performance obligations  in which case revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of such obligations 
accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for estimated bad debt losses on our accounts receivable based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
since our accounts receivable are not concentrated within a relatively few number of customers  we believe that a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer would not have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and therefore our future operating results 
while bad debt losses depend to a large degree on future economic conditions affecting our customers  we do not anticipate significant bad debt losses in inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on inventory quantities on hand  our historical product sales  and estimated forecast of future product demand and production requirements 
although we believe that our current inventory reserves are adequate  any significant change in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and therefore our future operating results 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining our income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
we apply an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event we determine that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
at december   the valuation allowance primarily reflected uncertainties involving the realization of certain tax credits and loss carryforwards due to the potential impact of future stock option exercises and shorter term tax asset expiration dates 
results of operations years ended december  and total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in product revenues to million in the current period as compared to million in the prior year 
revenues generated from the use of our products in reconstructive surgical procedures increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the growth was driven by increased demand for alloderm  partially offset by a decrease in cymetra revenues 
alloderm revenues increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in cymetra revenues have been negatively impacted by competitive products and we expect this trend to continue in revenues generated from the use of our repliform product in urogynecologic surgical procedures decreased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in demand for repliform in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence has been negatively affected by competition from synthetic alternatives and we anticipate this negative trend to continue in orthopedic product revenue grew to million in from  in this revenue growth resulted primarily from the full market launch of our graft jacket product in the first quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we introduced allocraft dbm on a limited basis and revenues from this product were not significant in our independent sales and marketing agents and distributors generated of our total product revenue in the year ended december  and in one of our independent agents  boston scientific corporation  represented of our total product revenues in compared to for the same period in no other individual independent sales agent or distributor generated more than of our total product revenues in the year ended december  total revenues were also favorably impacted by a increase in research grant revenues  which totaled million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in research spending on projects funded by approved research grants  since research grant revenues are recognized when qualified expenses are incurred 
as of december   approximately million of approved grant funding was available to fund future research and development expenses through cost of products sold for the year ended december  was million  or of product revenues  compared to cost of products sold of million  or of product revenue for the same period in the increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of products sold was primarily the result of costs related to the launch of allocraft dbm 
total research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily associated with higher spending on research focused on the potential application of our tissue matrix technology to vascular tissue  which is funded through a grant from the department of defense  and increased spending on allocraft dbm product development and other product development programs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll and related expenses  professional fees and  training and travel expenses associated with training and implementation costs associated with a new fully integrated computer software system 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase in was primarily attributable to higher selling expense associated with the expansion of our direct sales force and an increase in marketing expenses relating to launch of alloderm for new surgical indications 
our marketing agents are paid agency fees based on the amount of product revenues they generate for us 
selling and marketing expenses include marketing agent fees of million and million  respectively  in and the decrease in agent fees resulted from the decrease in revenue generated through our independent sales and marketing agents 
interest and other income expense  net decreased  in the year ended december  compared to the net decrease was due to a  decrease in interest expense resulting from a decrease in debt outstanding and a  increase in interest income  partially offset by a  loss on the disposal of fixed assets 
prior to  no deferred provision or benefit for federal income taxes was recorded because we were in a net deferred tax asset position and a full valuation allowance had been recorded 
during the fourth quarter of  we re evaluated the amount of valuation allowance required in light of profitability achieved in recent years and expected in future years 
as a result  we reduced the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not of being realized based on our assessment of the likelihood of future taxable income 
the reduction in the valuation allowance resulted in the recognition of a non cash income tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of at december   the valuation allowance primarily reflected uncertainties involving the realization of certain tax credits and loss carryforwards due to the potential impact of future stock option exercises and shorter term tax asset expiration dates 
in  we also realized  through the sale and transfer of million of state tax net operating losses 
in  we realized  through the sale and transfer of million of state tax net operating losses 
the sales and transfers were made through the technology business tax certificate program sponsored by the new jersey economic development authority 
years ended december  and total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million in the increase was principally attributable to a increase in product revenues to million in the current year as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in product revenues was largely due to increased demand for our alloderm products 
alloderm revenues increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the same period in repliform revenues increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in cymetra revenues decreased to million in compared to million in for the year ended december   our independent sales and marketing agents and distributors generated of our total product revenues 
during  sales of our products through boston scientific corporation and omp  inc represented and  respectively  of our total product revenues compared to and  respectively  in no other independent sales agent or distributor generated more than of our total product revenues in total revenues were also favorably impacted by a increase in research grant revenues  which totaled million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in research spending on projects funded by research grants  since research grant revenues are recognized when qualified expenses are incurred 
during  we were awarded grants from the department of defense and the national institute of health totaling  as of december   approximately million of approved grant funding was available to fund future research and development expenses through cost of products sold for the year ended december  was million  or of product revenues  compared to cost of products sold of million  or for the same period in the cost of products sold decreased as a percentage of product revenues due to efficiencies realized in our processing operation as a result of volume increases and process improvements 
total research and development expenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily associated with higher spending on research focused on the potential application of our tissue matrix technology to vascular tissue  which is funded through a grant from the department of defense  and increased spending on other product development projects 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of increased investor relations activities  higher recruiting expenses and payroll related costs 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in compared to million in the same period in the increase in was primarily attributable to higher selling expense associated with the increase in product revenues 
selling and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of product revenues from in to in selling and marketing expenses include marketing agent fees of million and million  respectively  in and interest and other income expense  net decreased  in compared to the net decrease was due to a  decrease in interest expense  resulting from a decrease in debt outstanding  partially offset by a  decline in interest income resulting from lower average interest rates during the period 
in the year ended december   we recorded a net tax benefit of  consisting of a provision for state income taxes of  offset by proceeds of  from the sale of state net operating losses 
the sale was made through the technology business tax certificate program sponsored by the new jersey economic development authority 
no federal provision for income taxes has been recorded as we intend to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to offset our estimated federal tax liability of  we were unable to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to offset our state tax liability in because the state of new jersey enacted tax legislation during the year suspending the use of loss carryforwards to offset taxable income in and we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on the uncertainty as to whether it is more likely than not that we will realize future benefit of these assets 
preferred stock and deemed dividends totaled million for the year ended december  and consisted of  of preferred stock dividends  which ceased accruing september   and a non cash deemed dividend of million recorded in connection with issuance of additional shares and the re pricing of warrants  pursuant to the terms of an investment made in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to million at december  working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital resulted principally from the million net proceeds from the private placement of our common stock in our operating activities generated net cash of  for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in although net income increased in compared to  net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to higher cash used to fund the net increase in working capital 
accounts receivable increased million from december  due to the higher revenues in the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of inventories increased by million in due to higher receipts of tissue from our tissue banks and a planned increase in processed tissue to support the increase in demand and full launch of allocraft dbm 
our investing activities  which consist of purchases of investments and capital equipment  used net cash of million for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the increase in resulted principally from the purchase of million of investments and purchases of hardware and software for a new fully integrated computer system and production equipment 
our financing activities generated million for the year ended december  compared to million used for principal payments on long term debt in in  we received net proceeds of million from the private placement of our common stock and the exercise of warrants and options to purchase common stock 
during  we utilized  to retire all of our outstanding long term debt 
at december   we had no debt outstanding under our borrowing arrangements compared to  outstanding at december   and remaining availability on a revolving credit line of million 
in march  the financial institution increased the borrowing limit on the revolving line of credit to million and extended the expiration through march the credit facility is collateralized by the company s accounts receivable  inventory  intellectual property  intangible and fixed assets and contains certain financial covenants and a subjective acceleration clause 
as of december  we were in compliance with the covenants of our credit facility 
the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period less than to to after total one year years years years operating leases     total contractual cash obligations     we believe that our current cash resources together with anticipated product revenues  committed research and development grant funding and remaining availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our planned operations  research and development programs and fixed asset requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that such sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our long term needs and as a result  we may need additional funding 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding from either debt or equity financing  collaborative arrangements or other sources on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
it is possible that our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of pending litigation or as a result of the cost of contesting such legal action
