photography market overview there are three main categories of cameras within the amateur photography market o digital cameras a digital camera uses an electronic sensor and other components to electronically capture and process an image versus silver halide film  which is then stored within memory 
digital cameras with image review capability allow for instantaneous viewing 
in addition  images can be downloaded to a computer for viewing  manipulation  reproduction and storage 
based upon available third party market research data  approximately million consumer digital cameras were sold worldwide in calendar a increase in the number of units sold as compared to calendar generating retail sales values of approximately billion 
consumer digital cameras are cameras capturing images in digital format only  and exclude digital cameras with interchangeable lenses digital slr  cameras that operate only when connected to a pc pc cameras and camera phones 
o single use cameras single use cameras are sold preloaded with film and batteries and are designed to be used only once by the consumer 
after use  the consumer returns the entire camera to the photo processor 
the processor then extracts the film and either disposes of the used camera or returns and or sells it for recycling 
according to third party market research data  on a unit basis  single use camera sales grew to approximately million units in calendar a increase over and accounted for approximately of all non digital cameras sold worldwide 
o traditional film cameras this category includes essentially all other non single use cameras that use silver halide film 
film formats include both mm and advanced photo system aps cameras 
according to third party market research  on a unit basis  mm and aps cameras accounted for approximately million or about of all non digital cameras sold worldwide in calendar a decrease of as compared to 
market trends market trends within the image capture industry include the following o growth of digital photography 
digital photography is one of the fastest growing areas of the photography market 
according to available third party market research data  worldwide consumer digital camera unit sales grew at an average rate of approximately per calendar year from through  and are projected to grow at an average rate of approximately per calendar year with unit sales expected to surpass million units in despite their relatively recent acceptance in the consumer market  digital camera sales have already surpassed sales of instant cameras  single lens reflex cameras slrs and traditional mm and aps cameras 
o new digital image capture devices 
in a clear departure from silver halide photography  digital imaging enables images to be displayed and used in ways that were previously impossible 
device manufacturers have begun to incorporate image capture devices into cellular phones  personal digital assistants  laptop computers and security monitoring devices 
o growth of single use cameras 
single use cameras are inexpensive  easy to use and deliver high quality photographs 
from through  the number of single use cameras sold worldwide grew at a compound annual rate of  according to available third party market research data 
products our products include digital  mm traditional and single use cameras 
we sell to our retail customers our own branded and private label products  a number of which we have developed and manufactured 
we also serve as a contract manufacturer of developed and co developed products for our customers 
we offer a variety of cmos and ccd imager based digital cameras  ranging from vga resolution up to and including mega pixels 
during fiscal  we completed the development of a number of new digital cameras and currently have additional products in various stages of development 
from these products  we have built and are selling new camera models 
these products are designed for configuration flexibility so that features  styles and user interfaces can be changed  allowing for other models and appearances using a common base to accommodate different user and customer preferences 
cmos is the acronym for complementary metal oxide semiconductor 
ccd is the acronym for charge coupled device 
vga is the acronym for video graphics array 
we also offer a complete line of single use cameras which has enabled us to provide encasements  finishes and packaging to accommodate different user and customer preferences 
our mm camera products range from entry level to higher priced  fully featured zoom models and include models used by certain rsd customers to support special promotion and loyalty programs they offer to their customers 
our expenditures for product design and development increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal we expect design and product development expense to decrease in fiscal as we increase the percentage of products purchased from third party manufacturers 
for additional information regarding product development costs  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
sales and marketing we make direct sales to retailers on a worldwide basis through offices and or representatives in the united states  latin america and canada americas  offices in the united kingdom  france and germany europe and offices in hong kong  china and japan asia 
concord asia is also involved in dms sales  as well as sales to and sales support for large retail customers in the americas  europe and asia 
we have marketed our products to retailers on a private label basis and or under the following brand names o argus o goldline o apex o go wireless o concord o jenoptik o concord eye q o keystone o easyshot o le clic o fun shooter o polaroid we have established our presence with our retail customers by offering attractive  easy to use and popularly priced digital  aps  and mm format cameras and mm and aps format single use cameras 
we produce many different types of cameras which are sold through thousands of retail outlets 
we have in house sales and marketing personnel who make the majority of our direct sales to dms and retail customers 
to assist our in house rsd sales staff  we also have nine independent sales representatives who serve specific geographic areas 
sales representatives generally receive commissions ranging from to of net sales to retail customers  depending on the type of customer  and may act as sales representatives for manufacturers of other non photographic products 
we also sell products to distributors who  in turn  sell our product to retailers 
competition the image capture industry  and particularly digital products which are very volatile  is highly competitive with over companies marketing products to the retail market 
as a manufacturer and distributor of popularly priced  image capture devices  we encounter substantial competition from a number of companies  many of which have longer operating histories  more established markets and brand recognition  and more extensive research and development and manufacturing capabilities than we have 
key competitors include canon  fuji  hewlett packard  kodak  olympus  nikon  sony  pentax  konica minolta  panasonic  samsung and vivitar 
many of these competitors have greater resources than we have or may reasonably be expected to have in the foreseeable future 
our competitive position is dependent upon our ability to develop and manufacture or purchase from third party manufacturers high quality products at the lowest cost 
backlog due to the lead time required for production and shipping and the need to build inventory to meet seasonal demand  we may at times have a backlog of orders for products 
we define backlog as unfulfilled orders supported by signed contracts or purchase orders for delivery of our products generally within the next six months 
our backlog at july  was approximately million 
we experience fluctuations in our backlog at various times during our fiscal year 
we expect that approximately million of the unfulfilled orders at july  will be shipped during the first quarter of fiscal although we believe that our entire backlog consists of firm orders  our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual revenue for any future period because of the possibility of customer cancellations and order changes and changes in delivery schedules and delays inherent in the shipments of products 
no assurance can be given that the current backlog will necessarily lead to revenue in any specific future period 
major customers our rsd sales to retailers represented million  or  of total net sales in fiscal  compared to million or of total net sales in fiscal the year over year increase in rsd sales was attributable  in part  to the introduction of new products and marketing programs 
in fiscal  we had two retail customers each of whose purchases represented in excess of of our total net sales i wal mart of total net sales  and ii walgreens of total net sales 
dms customers accounted for million  or  of our total net sales in fiscal in fiscal  sales to kodak accounted for or million of our total net sales 
we manufacture products for kodak under two dms contracts 
we have received notification from kodak that it intends to cease purchases under our two dms contracts by the end of the second quarter of fiscal we expect sales to kodak in fiscal to be approximately million 
seasonality sales of our products are linked to the timing of vacations  holidays and other leisure activities 
sales are normally strongest in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year as demand is high as retailers prepare for the holiday season 
sales are also strong in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year due to demand driven by heavy vacation activity  and events such as weddings and graduations 
sales are normally lowest in the third quarter of our fiscal year due to the absence of holidays and fewer people taking vacations during that time 
licensing activities in august  we entered into two license agreements with polaroid corporation 
these licenses provide for the exclusive with the exception of products already released by polaroid into the distribution chain  worldwide use of the polaroid brand trademark in connection with the manufacture  distribution  promotion and sale of mm and aps single use cameras  mm and aps manual and motorized traditional cameras  including zoom cameras  and certain related accessories

each license includes an initial term of three and a half years and may be renewed at our option for an additional three year period 
we have a worldwide excluding japan until january  non exclusive license to use certain of fuji s single use camera patents and patent applications in connection with the manufacture  remanufacture and sale of single use cameras 
the license extends until the later of february  or the expiration of the last of the licensed fuji patents to expire 
single use cameras accounted for million  or  of our fiscal net sales 
as part of the acquisition of jenimage  we entered into a twenty year  worldwide trademark license agreement with jenoptik ag for the exclusive use of the jenoptik brand name and trademark on non professional consumer imaging products including  but not limited to  digital  single use and traditional cameras  and other imaging products and related accessories

raw materials and components that we purchase include film  batteries  glass lenses  plastic resins  metal  packaging  electronic components  sensors  digital signal processors  memory and displays 
digital camera procurement and component procurement for digital cameras is more complex than for traditional and single use cameras 
availability  longer procurement lead times  delays in procurement  and price fluctuations of digital cameras and the components for digital cameras  which are outside our control  have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business  inventory position  results of operations and financial condition see risk factors in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation below

we also license the jenoptik trademark on a worldwide basis for non professional consumer imaging products and accessories both digital and film based 
we own numerous patents  certain of which are used in our current products 
we have applied for  and will continue to apply for  in the united states and foreign countries  patents to protect the inventions and technology developed by or for the company 
we do not believe our competitiveness and market share are dependent on the ultimate disposition of our patent applications 
we license patents and patent applications related to single use cameras from fuji in connection with the manufacture and sale of single use cameras

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the fiscal consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto 
except for historical information contained herein  the matters discussed below are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  economic  governmental  political  competitive and technological factors affecting the company s operations  markets  products  prices and other factors discussed elsewhere in this report and other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission sec 
see risk factors below 
these factors may cause results to differ materially from the statements made in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of the company 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and sell on a worldwide basis popularly priced  easy to use image capture products 
our products include digital  mm traditional and single use cameras 
we manufacture and assemble products in the prc  and purchase a significant amount of products from third party manufacturers for sales to our retail customers under our brand names and on a premium and private label basis to our dms customers 
we expect purchases of products from third party manufacturers will continue to increase in fiscal and ensuing years to ensure that we deliver the optimal product mix on a timely basis to our customers 
fiscal losses were primarily attributable to our digital camera products 
we have initiated a strategic review process to  in part  determine how we may better compete in the digital camera market 
as part of this process  we are evaluating a number of strategies related to digital cameras 
the review process is not complete and no decision has been made at this time 
the loss in fiscal was higher than expected primarily due to the following factors lower than anticipated net digital camera sales  higher than expected provisions for digital camera returns and allowances  higher digital camera and component inventory provisions  lower than anticipated digital camera production volumes which resulted in manufacturing inefficiencies and other costs  higher selling  general and administrative costs  impairment of goodwill  and increased deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
lower than anticipated net digital camera sales during the second half of fiscal  the digital camera market in the united states and europe faced significant competition primarily due to higher inventories at our retail customers  competitors and other manufacturers 
higher inventories led to fierce price competition in digital camera products 
while the aggregate amount of digital camera sales increased over last year due to an increase in the average selling price of digital cameras  unit volume and average selling prices were below expectations because of competitive pricing and weak sell through with several retail customers 
we reduced selling prices of digital camera products to meet significant competition 
higher than expected provisions for digital camera returns and allowances excess retailer inventory and fierce price competition led to significant increases in our provision for digital camera allowances 
in addition  provisions for digital camera returns provisions significantly increased primarily as a result of lower than expected sell through activity at our retail customers 
digital camera and component inventory provisions significant competition resulted in substantial price declines in digital cameras and led to an million inventory charge to lower the carrying values of certain digital camera components and finished goods inventories below their cost basis to their estimated net realizable values 
we anticipate that in fiscal  sales of certain digital cameras whose carrying values were reduced will result in significantly lower gross profit in both dollars and percentages of net sales as there will be approximately no margin on the sales of these products 
lower than anticipated digital camera production volumes which resulted in manufacturing inefficiencies and other costs lower than expected demand and  therefore  lower production volumes in our manufacturing facilities created significant under absorption of manufacturing labor and overhead costs 
these factors led to significantly lower gross profit in both dollars and as a percentage of sales 
higher selling  general and administrative costs these costs have also increased as we have invested in our anticipated future growth through the addition of personnel 
we have incurred higher selling costs resulting primarily from the cost of additional sales and marketing personnel and variable costs related to higher sales 
general and administrative costs have increased due to the design and implementation of our new erp system  and significant costs associated with implementing measures necessary to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley and related regulations 
impairment of goodwill we performed an impairment test of our existing goodwill as of july  under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment exists if the net book value of the reporting units exceed their fair value 
we utilized our market capitalization at july  to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
as a result of the impairment test  we recorded a million impairment charge for all of our goodwill 
increased deferred income tax asset valuation allowance we increased our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by million 
this increase had the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes by approximately million in this fiscal year 
we determined that we may not be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in hong kong  europe and the us in addition  we did not record the benefit of our current year losses as we have determined that it is not more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our application of accounting policies affects these estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable  which is generally when the product is delivered to the customer 
revenues are recorded net of anticipated returns which the company estimates based on historical rates of return  adjusted for current events as appropriate 
revenues are also recorded net of certain allowances provided to customers  including those related to advertising  discounts  and other promotions 
sales returns we establish a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical product return trends 
if the actual future returns are higher than we originally estimated which was based upon historical data  our net sales could be adversely affected 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts owed to us could be adversely affected 
inventories inventory purchases and commitments are based upon estimates of future demand which is difficult to forecast 
if i there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  ii there is a higher rate of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  and or iii the market value and selling prices of our products to our customers decline or the price at which these customers can purchase similar products from other manufacturers is lower than ours  we may be required to reduce our inventory values resulting from lower of cost or market value adjustments and our gross profit could be significantly adversely affected 
the obsolescence risk related to digital cameras is more significant than traditional mm and single use cameras due to the shorter life cycles of digital products see risk factors below 
deferred income taxes the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance is based on our assessment of the realizability of our deferred income tax assets on an ongoing basis and may be adjusted from time to time as necessary 
in determining the valuation allowance  we have considered future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives and strategies 
the company has a full valuation allowance on all of its deferred income tax assets as of july  should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance and increase income 
on the contrary  if we determine that we would not be able to realize a recorded deferred income tax asset  an adjustment to increase our valuation allowance would be charged to the results of operations in the period such conclusion was made 
such charge could have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes included in our results of operations 
impairment of long lived and other assets periodically  we review our long lived assets for impairment 
we will record an impairment loss when indications of impairment are present and where undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
since the company incurred a significant operating loss during fiscal  a potential impairment indicator  it performed an impairment test of its long lived and other assets as of july  the company performed an impairment test by summarizing the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual sale of its long lived and other assets  excluding goodwill 
the sum of the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying values of these assets and  accordingly  the company concluded these carrying values are recoverable 
no impairment indicators were identified for fiscal or fiscal for royalty related assets  we will record an impairment loss if the total expected royalty payments to be made over the life of an agreement  excluding any minimum required payments  are less than the royalty related assets carrying value 
the total expected royalty payments to be made over the life of an agreement are dependent on management s estimates about future sales volumes 
because judgment is required to estimate future sales volumes  the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the sales volumes that will actually be realized in the future 
such assets that are reviewed include patents  goodwill  licensing and royalty agreements and certain property  plant and equipment 
accounting for litigation and settlements we are involved in various legal proceedings 
due to their nature  such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties and the possibility of governmental intervention 
management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances  as appropriate 
management believes that any liability to the company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company taken as a whole 
off balance sheet arrangements under sec regulations  in certain circumstances  we are required to make certain disclosures regarding the following off balance sheet arrangements  if material any obligation under certain guarantee contracts  any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that we are required to disclose pursuant to these regulations  other than those described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we do not have  nor do we engage in  transactions with any special purpose entities 
we are not engaged in hedging activities and had no forward exchange contracts or other derivatives outstanding at july  in the ordinary course of business  we enter into operating lease commitments  purchase commitments and other contractual obligations 
these transactions are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  and are more fully discussed below in liquidity and capital resources

results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to net sales for fiscal the increase in sales was in large part due to new single use and traditional cameras sold to our rsd and dms customers 
rsd sales were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal  and accounted for of total net sales 
the growth in rsd net sales was mostly due to sales of private label traditional cameras and polaroid branded single use cameras  new customers and organic growth from customers due to sell through and new product introductions 
dms net sales were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to the same period last year  and accounted for of total net sales 
the increase in dms net sales was primarily attributable to sales of single use cameras to kodak  partially offset by lower sales to existing customers 
in fiscal  sales to kodak accounted for of total net sales or million 
we manufacture products for kodak under two dms contracts 
we have received notification from kodak that they intend to cease purchases under our two dms contracts by the end of the second quarter of fiscal we expect sales to kodak in fiscal to be approximately million 
rsd net sales of our operations in the americas for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal the increase in rsd net sales was due to sales of polaroid branded and other single use and traditional cameras to new and existing customers resulting in increased market penetration  new digital camera product sales and organic growth from existing customers due to sell through and new product introductions

gross profit gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  versus million  or of net sales  in fiscal during fiscal  gross profit was negatively affected by an million pre tax charge to cost of products sold to lower the carrying value of certain digital camera and component inventories below their cost basis to their estimated net realizable value and increased depreciation expense by million related to the reduction of the remaining useful lives of molds and tooling related to certain digital cameras 
this resulted from the negative impact of a decline in the digital camera market  competitive pricing pressure and excess customer inventory levels 
in addition  higher manufacturing costs mainly resulting from production inefficiencies related to the production of digital camera products contributed to the decrease in gross profit  in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
incremental overhead costs associated with the costs incurred in implementing our new erp system also contributed to lower gross profit in fiscal the effect of changing its method of applying manufacturing labor and overhead costs to inventories during the first quarter of fiscal  then cost of products sold and net loss in fiscal each being approximately million higher per diluted share than under the prior method 
the comparable prior year period included a million benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of a previously disclosed disputed claim with a dms customer in the third quarter of fiscal partially offset by million of additional air freight costs due to the west coast dock worker s labor dispute 
product engineering  design and development costs for fiscal and fiscal  in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  were million and million  respectively

growth opportunities we are evaluating various growth opportunities that could require significant funding commitments 
we have from time to time held  and will continue to hold  discussions and negotiations with i companies that represent potential acquisition or investment opportunities  ii potential strategic and financial investors who have expressed an interest in making an investment in or acquiring us  iii potential joint venture partners looking toward formation of strategic alliances that would broaden our product base or enable us to enter new lines of business and iv potential new and existing dms customers where the design  development and production of new products  including certain new technologies  would enable us to expand our existing business  and enter new markets 
however  there can be no assurance that any definitive agreement  will be reached regarding any of the foregoing 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks regarding our company 
these and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report 
digital camera products are subject to rapid technological changes  price erosion  obsolescence and higher rates of returns and allowances 
digital camera products are subject to rapid technological changes  price erosion  obsolescence and rates of returns and allowances to a greater extent than traditional and single use camera products 
because of declines in pricing and rapid technological changes  some of our digital camera products became obsolete and or their values decreased and  consequently  we recorded significant lower of cost or market valuation adjustments related to digital inventory during fiscal similar charges related to lowering the carrying values and inventory provisions due to price erosion may be required in future periods 
average selling prices for our products decline over relatively short time periods 
many of our manufacturing costs are fixed 
when our average selling prices decline  our revenues decline unless we sell more units  and our gross profits and margins decline unless we are able to reduce our product costs by commensurate amounts and percentages 
our operating results suffer when gross profits and margins decline 
to be successful in the development  manufacture and sale of digital camera products  we have to react quickly to technological advances and market conditions and manage our inventory effectively to accommodate price declines and erosion resulting from competition and other factors and the short life span of such products 
due to severe pricing competition  allowances for digital cameras are considerably higher than those provided to customers for traditional and single use cameras 
our digital camera products involve more complex design  development and manufacturing processes  which we may not be able to successfully integrate into our operations  and we are dependent upon the continued availability of key components and finished digital camera products products 
digital cameras involve more complex design  development  manufacturing and product procurement processes and component procurement processes than our traditional mm and single use cameras 
manufacturing delays  including product and component procurement delays or shortages and the timely introduction and delivery of new components and products  which may be outside our control  could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
any disruption in the availability of key components or products or our suppliers ability to deliver quality components and products in time to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules could negatively impact our ability to achieve our growth and sales objectives 
we may experience a short supply of certain components and or products as a result of strong demand in the industry for them or problems experienced by our suppliers of components and or products 
if shortages or delays persist  the price of components and or products may increase  components and or products may not be available  and we may be exposed to component and or product quality issues 
we may not be able to secure sufficient components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products and or products at reasonable prices or acceptable quality in a timely manner in the quantities needed 
accordingly  our revenue  gross profits  margins and market share could suffer until other sources can be developed 
we depend on third party suppliers  and our revenue  gross profits and margins could suffer if we fail to manage supplier issues properly 
our manufacturing  sales and distribution operations  depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components and products and our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components and products at reasonable prices in time to meet critical manufacturing  sales and distribution schedules 
given the variety of products that we offer  the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are dispersed across the globe  and the long lead times that are required to manufacture  assemble and deliver certain components and products  adverse circumstances  issues and problems could arise in planning production  procurement and managing inventory levels that could negatively impact our business and increase our financial exposure and risk 
other supplier problems that we could face include component and product shortages  excess supply and risks related to fixed price contracts that would require us to pay more than the open market price  as more fully described below 
o supply shortages 
we may experience a short supply of  or a delay in receiving  certain components and products as a result of strong demand  capacity constraints or other problems experienced by suppliers 
if shortages or delays persist  the price of these components and products may increase  we may be exposed to quality issues or the components and products may not be available at all 
we may not be able to secure enough components and or products at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build  sell and distribute new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed 
accordingly  our revenue  gross profits and margins could suffer as we could lose time sensitive sales  incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers 
if we cannot adequately address supply issues  we may have to reengineer and or source some components and products  resulting in further costs and delays 
o oversupply 
in order to secure products or components for the production of new products  at times we may make advance payments to suppliers  or we may enter into non cancelable commitments with suppliers 
if we fail to adequately anticipate customer demand properly  an oversupply of products and or components could result in excess or obsolete inventory  which could adversely affect our gross profits and margins as a result of the financial exposure related to additional inventory 
o long term pricing commitments 
as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers  we may be obligated to purchase components and or products at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions 
in the event that we become committed to purchase components and or products for prices in excess of the current market price  we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components and or products at lower prices  and our gross profits and margins could suffer 
in addition  we may have to lower the carrying value of these components and or products by taking a charge 
in many instances we rely on offshore suppliers  including  but not limited to  manufacturers in the republic of china roc for the production of cameras and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 
regional economic  business  environmental  political  medical  or military conditions or events  as discussed elsewhere in these risk factors  could disrupt supplies in foreign locations 
we expect to continue to increase the purchase of products from third party manufacturers in fiscal the risks identified above will continue to increase as our purchases of products from these manufacturers increase 
our business strategies may not succeed 
during the normal course of our business  we evaluate  develop and implement various short term and long term business strategies 
some of these strategies  if implemented  may require significant financial and human resources 
there can be no assurance that any such strategies  if implemented  will be successful 
if such strategies do not succeed  it could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we have been advised of a material weakness as well as several reportable conditions in our financial controls relating to the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting 
in connection with its fiscal audit of our financial statements  the company s auditors communicated to the company s management and the audit committee of the board of directors several reportable conditions involving the company s internal financial controls 
reportable conditions involve matters coming to the attention of our accountants relating to significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls that  in their judgment  could adversely affect our ability to record  process  summarize  and report financial data consistent with the assertions of management in the consolidated financial statements 
the auditors also noted one reportable condition which they considered to be a material weakness in the company s internal controls 
a material weakness is defined as a reportable condition in which the design or operation of one or more of the internal control components does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that misstatements caused by error or fraud in amounts that would be material in relation to the financial statements being audited may occur and not be detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions 
the material weakness noted by the auditors is that the company s financial statement close process does not ensure that all material errors in accounts that involve significant estimation will be identified on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their duties 
specifically  the auditors noted that there were significant delays in accumulating data  performing analysis  and evaluating results 
other reportable conditions noted by the auditors related to the company s inventory valuation  revenue recognition and reserves and allowances processes 
risk of non compliance with the section of the sarbanes oxley act of beginning in fiscal  section of the sarbanes oxley act of the act will require the company to include an internal control report of management in its annual report on form k 
the internal control report must contain i a statement of management s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  ii a statement identifying the framework used by management to conduct the required evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  iii management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our most recent fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not internal control over financial reporting is effective  and iv a statement that the company s independent auditors have issued an attestation report on management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
management acknowledges its responsibility for internal controls over financial reporting and seeks to continually improve those controls 
in addition  in order to achieve compliance with section of the act within the prescribed period  beginning in fiscal  the company engaged in a process to document and evaluate its internal controls over financial reporting 
in this regard  management dedicated internal resources  engaged outside consultants and adopted a detailed work plan to i assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting  ii take steps to improve control processes where appropriate  iii validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and iv implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting 
the company believes the process it began in fiscal and is continuing in fiscal for documenting  evaluating and monitoring its internal control over financial reporting is consistent with the objectives of section of the act 
in addition  due to the company s implementation of a new erp system  in fiscal  it will again begin the process of documenting  evaluating and monitoring its internal control over financial reporting 
the company s documentation and testing to date have identified certain gaps in the design and effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting that the company will need to remediate 
in addition  the company will have to improve its financial controls as they relate to the matters described in the immediately preceding risk factor 
the company can provide no assurance as to its  or its independent auditors  conclusions at july  with respect to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting under section of the act 
the existence of the above factors and circumstances create a risk that the company  or its independent auditors  will not be able to conclude at july  that the company s internal controls over financial reporting are effective as required by section of the act 
risks related to digital  mm traditional and single use camera markets 
based upon available third party market research data  the digital camera market is expected to continue to grow in the united states and europe for a number of years but then flatten  the mm traditional camera market has been in decline and is expected to continue to decline  and the single use camera market is expected to grow slightly through calendar but then flatten and decline 
there is no assurance that our digital and single use camera sales will continue to increase  or that  even if they continue to increase  they will be profitable or that we will be able to maintain our digital  mm traditional and single use camera market shares 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with sales to our customers 
we sell a significant number of imaging and other products to a relatively small number of customers 
receivables arising from these sales are generally not collateralized 
we monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and review outstanding receivable balances for collectibility on a regular basis and record provisions for doubtful accounts  allowances and returns  as necessary 
in the past  we have had customers file for protection from their creditors under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  we have recognized provisions related to accounts receivable and inventory 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations above 
we are dependent on certain important customers 
we have a number of customers that are very important to our business 
our products are sold in very competitive markets 
our competitors may adopt more aggressive policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products  which could result in a loss of sales or of customers 
the loss of sales or of one or more of these important customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are exposed to risks associated with intellectual property used in image capture devices 
image capture devices use technology which may be protected by united states or foreign patents 
the right to use such intellectual property is subject to the availability of licenses from the patent holders 
if licenses are not available or are only available on onerous terms our business could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the defense of patent infringement claims could be time consuming and costly 
from time to time we receive patent infringement claims which we analyze and  if appropriate  may either take action to avoid infringement or negotiate a license 
in at least two such instances  one of which involves one of our largest customers  we engaged in discussions looking toward licensing of certain digital image capture technology 
in a third instance  a patent infringement suit has been filed against the company 
relocation time and expenses could result in substantial losses 
if we determine it is necessary to relocate our manufacturing facilities from the people s republic of china prc  or to another location within the prc  due to confiscation  expropriation  nationalization  embargoes  governmental restrictions or for other regulatory  business and or financial reasons  we would incur substantial operating and capital losses including losses resulting from business interruption and delays in production 
in addition  as a result of a relocation of our manufacturing equipment and other assets  we may incur relatively higher manufacturing costs  which could reduce sales and decrease the current gross profits and margins on the products we manufacture 
relocation of our manufacturing operations would also result in disruption in the delivery of our products  which could  in turn  reduce demand for our products in the future 
most of our operations in the prc are subject to administration of its local governmental agencies 
the continuing viability of our prc agreements is crucial to our business operations in the prc 
we manufacture a large number of the components used in our cameras and assemble all of our own manufactured finished products at our facilities in the prc 
during fiscal  based upon production demand  we had approximately  to  workers at our manufacturing facilities in the prc either employed by our prc subsidiaries or through our agreements with various prc government or quasi government agencies 
we are responsible for their wages  food and housing and must comply with a variety of local labor and employee benefit laws covering these workers 
while we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws as currently enforced  these laws are subject to modification and interpretation by the applicable local governmental authorities 
we cannot predict the impact of any future modifications to or strict enforcement of the existing laws 
in addition  the termination or material modification of any of our agreements with the prc quasi government agencies could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations 
we are exposed to political  economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 
we have significant operations outside the united states 
we currently have operations in hong kong  japan  the prc  canada  the united kingdom  france and germany 
further  we obtain raw materials  components and finished camera products from foreign suppliers 
accordingly  our business is subject to the political  economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in foreign countries 
these risks include  but are not limited to o the difficulty of enforcing agreements  collecting receivables and protecting assets through foreign legal systems  o trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  o the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions  o difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations  o required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  o changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate  particularly in emerging markets  and o increased costs and risks of doing business in a number of foreign jurisdictions 
our business success depends in part on our ability to successfully anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks 
no assurance can be given that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
political and economic uncertainties in the prc could affect our business 
our business could be adversely affected by the imposition in the prc of austerity measures intended to reduce inflation  which could result in the inadequate development or maintenance of infrastructure  the unavailability of adequate power and water supplies  transportation  products  components  raw material and parts  or a deterioration of the general political  economic or social environment in the prc in addition to the availability of workers at reasonable costs 
the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system presents certain risks 
during august  we converted from our existing legacy systems to a new erp system 
this design and implementation project began in july and now provides an important element of our accounting  financial and operating functions and systems  including sales  supply chain and manufacturing operating systems 
there continue to be significant costs associated with implementing the new erp system  in terms of both financial and the human resources to be incurred and expended 
in addition  there are certain risks associated with any conversion to a new information technology system which includes software  hardware and human resources  including a potential disruption in our operating systems and controls and the possibility of adverse circumstances  issues and problems associated with the conversion of electronic data 
if these issues are not properly and adequately addressed  it could result in the diversion of management s and other personnel s attention and resources  and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and impact our ability to manage our business 
interest rate and exchange rate risk as a result of our global operating and financing activities  we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
exchange rates and interest rates in certain markets in which we do business tend to be more volatile than those in the united states and western europe 
if there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country  the prices of our products will increase relative to that country s currency and our products may be less competitive in that country 
we generally do not engage in currency hedging activities 
the interest rate related to our credit facilities in hong kong is based on a spread over the sibor singapore interbank offered rate 
a significant change in the sibor rate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
currently we are not utilizing any interest rate protection agreements to limit our exposure to this risk 
effect of losses and indebtedness on cash flow our primary source of liquidity has been provided by our short term investments  reductions in working capital balances and borrowing availability under our million credit facility in hong kong 
due to recent losses  the level of reliance on our credit facility could increase and  as a result  create liquidity issues for the company due to funding and debt service requirements 
increased indebtedness could interfere with our ability to effectively operate our business 
we are dependent on a small group of key personnel 
our business is managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel 
in particular  we rely on the continued services of ira b 
lampert  our chairman  chief executive officer and president 
the loss of key management and operating personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business 
we believe our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract highly skilled and qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we may not be able to hire the necessary personnel to implement our business strategies  or we may need to pay higher compensation for employees than currently budgeted and or anticipated in the future 
our inability to attract and retain such personnel could limit our growth and affect our results of operations 
the camera and photographic products industry is highly competitive 
as a manufacturer  marketer and distributor of low cost  popularly priced image capture products  we encounter intense competition from a number of companies  many of which have longer operating histories  more established markets  better brand recognition  more extensive facilities and  in some cases  greater resources 
these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes  price reductions  and or increased operating costs  such as for marketing and sales incentives  resulting in lower revenues  gross margins and income 
our future tax rates could increase 
a number of factors will affect our tax rate in the future  and the combined effect of these factors could result in an increase in our effective tax rate as compared to our effective tax rate in fiscal this would adversely affect net income in future periods 
we operate in different countries that have different income tax rates 
based upon our apportionment of income  our effective tax rate could fluctuate 
changes in tax laws in the united states may further limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses 
any further limitation on our ability to utilize our net operating losses could adversely affect our results of operations 
the importation of products into the united states and other countries in which our products are sold is subject to various other risks 
the united states  the prc  hong kong  the european union or other countries may impose trade restrictions that could adversely affect our operations 
in addition  the united states is currently monitoring various prc practices  including trade  investment and government procurement  as well as the prc s compliance with various multilateral and bilateral agreements 
we cannot predict whether the united states will take future trade actions against the prc that may result in increased tariffs against prc products  including products imported by us 
our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters  business interruptions or similar events  including the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
disasters such as hurricanes  typhoons  earthquakes  or acts of nature or god  terrorist attacks  water  fire  electricity failure  or accidents affecting our operating activities  facilities  and employees and customers health could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in particular  our operations in the prc  as well as most of our third party manufacturers  suppliers and service providers involved in the manufacturing of components and products are located within a relatively close proximity of one another in the prc 
therefore  any disaster that strikes within close proximity of that geographic area could be exceedingly disruptive to our business and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we do not currently have a disaster recovery plan 
in the event of another outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  or some other disease or health related issue  our facilities and or the facilities of our third party manufacturers and service providers located in hong kong  the prc and other parts of the world could be quarantined  temporarily closed or disrupted 
if this occurs  it could delay or prevent us from developing new products or manufacturing  testing or shipping our current or future products  and may require us to find other providers of such services and or products  which may be unavailable or more expensive 
further  if a sars outbreak has an adverse impact on the businesses of our customers  it could reduce the size and or frequency of our customers purchases  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
we may not be able to identify and integrate future acquisitions 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions that we consider reasonable in light of the revenues and the results of operations we believe we will be able to achieve  from these acquisitions  once combined and intergrated with the company 
the cost of acquisitions within the industry has generally increased over time 
additionally  we compete for acquisitions with certain other industry competitors  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
increased demand for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition prices 
although we believe opportunities may exist for us to grow through acquisitions  we may not be able to identify and consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms 
if we do acquire another company or companies  we may not be able to profitably manage and successfully integrate the acquired company or companies with our operations  sales and marketing efforts without substantial costs or delays 
acquisitions involve a number of potential risks  including the potential loss of customers and contracts  increased leverage and debt service requirements  combining disparate company cultures and facilities and operating in geographically diverse markets 
one or more of our future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate 
the stock markets  and in particular the nasdaq national market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of such companies 
these broad market factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation s has often been instituted against a particular company 
such litigations have been instituted against us and could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
see note  litigation and settlements in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating and financial activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we manage exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financing activities 
at july   our exposure to changes in interest rates was limited  since we had no significant debt outstanding 
since we have no significant debt outstanding  we do not deem interest rate risk to be significant or material to our financial condition or results of operations 
we do not presently use derivative instruments to adjust our interest rate risk profile 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we utilize leveraged financial instruments 
each of our foreign subsidiaries purchases their inventories in us dollars and certain of their sales are in foreign currency  thereby creating an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have purchased and continue to purchase in foreign currencies certain components  products  raw materials and services needed to manufacture and sell our products 
the impact of foreign exchange transactions is reflected in our statements of operations 
as of july   we were not engaged in any hedging activities and we had no forward exchange contracts outstanding 
we continue to analyze the benefits and costs associated with hedging against foreign currency fluctuations
