overview tlc vision corporation including its subsidiaries is a diversified healthcare service company focused on working with eye doctors to help them provide high quality patient care in the eye care segment 
the majority of the company s revenues come from refractive surgery  which involves using an excimer laser to treat common refractive vision disorders such as myopia nearsightedness  hyperopia farsightedness and astigmatism 
the company s business model includes arrangements ranging from owning and operating fixed site centers to providing access to lasers through fixed site and mobile service relationships 
in addition to refractive surgery  the company is diversified into other eyecare businesses 
through its midwest surgical services  inc mss subsidiary  the company furnishes hospitals and independent surgeons with mobile or fixed site access to cataract surgery equipment and services 
through its or partners and aspen healthcare divisions  tlc vision develops  manages and has equity participation in single specialty eye care ambulatory surgery centers and multi specialty ambulatory surgery centers 
the company also owns a majority interest in vision source  which provides optometric franchise opportunities to independent optometrists 
in  the company formed a joint venture with vascular sciences corporation vascular sciences to create occulogix  lp  a partnership focused on the treatment of an eye disease  known as dry age related macular degeneration  via rheopheresis  a process for filtering blood 
effective june   the company changed its fiscal year end from may to december in accordance with an agreement and plan of merger with laservision centers  inc laservision  the company completed a business combination with laservision on may   which resulted in laservision becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of tlc vision 
accordingly  laservision s results are included in the company s statement of operations beginning on the date of acquisition 
laservision is a leading access service provider of excimer lasers  microkeratomes and other equipment and value and support services to eye surgeons 
the company believes that the combined companies provide a broader array of services to eye care professionals to ensure these individuals may provide superior quality of care and achieve outstanding clinical results 
the company believes this will be the long term determinant of success in the eye surgery services industry 
the company serves surgeons who performed approximately  refractive and cataract procedures at the company s centers or using the company s laser access services during the year ended december  the company is assessing patient  optometric and ophthalmic industry trends and developing strategies to improve laser vision correction procedure volumes and increase revenues 
cost reduction initiatives continue to target the effective use of funds  and our growth initiative is focusing on future development opportunities for the company in the eye care industry 
the company recognizes revenues at the time procedures are performed or services are rendered 
revenues include amounts charged patients for procedures performed at owned laser centers  amounts charged physicians for laser access and service fees  and management fees from managing refractive and secondary care practices 
under the terms of management service agreements  the company provides non clinical services  which include facilities  staffing  equipment lease and maintenance  marketing and administrative services to refractive and secondary care practices in return for management fees 
the management fees are typically addressed as a per procedure fee 
for third party payor programs and corporations with arrangements with tlc vision  the company s management fee and the fee charged by the surgeon are both discounted in proportion to the discount afforded to these organizations 
while the company does not direct the manner in which the surgeons practice medicine  the company does direct the day to day non clinical operations of the centers 
the management service agreements typically are for an extended period of time  ranging from to years 
management fees are equal to the net revenue of the physician practice  less amounts retained by the physician groups 
procedure volumes represent the number of laser vision correction procedures completed for which the amount that the patient has been invoiced for the procedure exceeds a predefined company wide per procedure revenue threshold 
procedures that may be invoiced for less than the threshold amounts primarily for promotional or marketing purposes and are not included in the procedure volume numbers reported 
doctors compensation as presented in the financial statements represents the cost to the company of engaging ophthalmic professionals to perform laser vision correction services at the company s owned laser centers and fees paid to optometrists for pre and post operative care 
where the company manages laser centers  the professional corporations or physicians performing the professional services at such centers engage ophthalmic professionals 
as such  the costs associated with arranging for these professionals to furnish professional services are reported as a cost of the professional corporation and not of the company 
included in costs of revenue are the laser fees payable to laser manufacturers for royalties  use and maintenance of the lasers  variable expenses for consumables and facility fees  as well as center costs associated with personnel  facilities and depreciation of center assets 
in company owned centers  the company engages doctors to provide laser vision correction services and the amounts paid to the doctors also are reported as a cost of revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses that are not directly related to the provision of laser correction services or cataract services 
in the twelve months ended december   the company s procedure volume increased to  compared to  in the twelve months ended december   an increase of  procedures or  
procedures for fiscal include a full year of operations for laservision  while the prior year period includes laservision only subsequent its acquisition in may in addition to the higher procedures related to a full year of laservision operations  the company believes that the increase in procedure volume was indicative of the stabilization of the laser vision correction industry as a whole 
the laser vision correction industry has experienced uncertainty resulting from a number of issues over the past few years  but the industry began improving during as the us economy strengthened 
being an elective procedure  laser vision correction volumes will fluctuate due to changes in economic and stock market conditions  unemployment rates  consumer confidence and political uncertainty 
demand for laser vision correction also is affected by perceived safety and effectiveness concerns arising from the lack of long term follow up data and negative news stories focusing on patients with unfavorable outcomes from procedures performed at centers competing with the company 
developments during fiscal acquisitions on december   a majority owned subsidiary of the company became a majority owner of an ambulatory surgery center asc in michigan when that asc purchased some of its shares from one of its investors 
after this change in ownership interest  the company s subsidiary owned of this asc 
therefore  this asc was included in the consolidated balance sheet at december  and included in the operating results of the company using the equity accounting method during the year 
during  this asc s operating results will be reported on a consolidated basis 
on november   a majority owned subsidiary of the company acquired of a medical practice in ohio for million  of which the company paid million 
on september   or partners  inc  a subsidiary of tlc vision  acquired of phoenix eye surgical center  llc  which operates an ambulatory surgery center in arizona that primarily performs cataract surgery 
the company paid million in cash for its interest and received net assets with a book value of million 
accordingly  million was recorded as intangible assets  primarily goodwill 
on march   midwest surgical services  inc  a subsidiary of tlc vision  entered into a purchase agreement to acquire of american eye instruments  inc  which provides access to surgical and diagnostic equipment to perform cataract surgery in hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers 
the company paid million in cash and issued  common shares 
the company also agreed to make additional cash payments over a three year period up to million  if certain financial targets are achieved 
of this amount  million was non contingent and was recorded as a liability as of december  on august   the company paid million in cash to acquire a ownership interest in an asc in mississippi which specializes in cataract surgery 
in august  the company purchased an additional ownership for million in cash  substantially all of which was recorded as goodwill 
the company also has an obligation to purchase an additional ownership interest per year for million in cash per year during each of the next three years 
restructuring during the year ended december   the company recorded a million restructuring charge primarily related to the closure of six centers 
total restructuring expense for fiscal of million consisted of million offset by the reversal into income of million of restructuring charges related to prior year accruals that were no longer needed as of december  the company will fund restructuring costs through the company s cash and cash equivalents on hand 
a total of million of this provision related to non cash costs of writing down fixed assets  million related to non cash costs of writing off prepaid expenses  investments and laser commitments  million related to severance and million related to the net future cash costs for lease commitments and costs to sublet available space offset by sub lease income 
the lease costs will be paid out over the remaining term of the lease 
research and development during fiscal  the company entered into a joint venture with vascular sciences for the purpose of pursuing commercial applications of technologies owned or licensed by vascular sciences applicable to the evaluation  diagnosis  monitoring and treatment of dry age related macular degeneration 
the company purchased million in series b preferred stock in and expensed it as a research and development arrangement 
during  the company agreed to advance up to an additional million to vascular sciences pursuant to a secured convertible grid debenture 
the first million advanced pursuant to such debenture is convertible into common shares of vascular sciences 
vascular sciences has also granted an option to the company to acquire an amount of common shares equal to the undrawn portion of the debenture at any point in time 
in fiscal  the company expensed million to research and development related to payments made to vascular sciences during the year 
of this amount  million reduced the value of the million obligation to vascular sciences  and million represented an additional equity investment in common stock and therefore did not reduce the amount of the remaining obligation 
critical accounting policies impairment of goodwill the company accounts for its goodwill in accordance with sfas  which requires the company to test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
sfas requires the company to determine the fair value of its reporting units 
because quoted market prices do not exist for the company s reporting units  the company uses the present value of expected future cash flows to estimate fair value 
management must make significant estimates and assumptions about future conditions to estimate future cash flows 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  including general economic and competitive conditions  the company may be required to record impairment charges related to these assets 
during the transitional period ended december  and the fiscal year ended may   the company determined that significant impairments in the value of the goodwill had occurred and recorded charges to earnings in both periods 
impairment of long lived assets the company accounts for its long lived assets in accordance with sfas  which requires the company to assess the recoverability of these assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived asset group might not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators exist  the company determines whether the projected undiscounted cash flows will be sufficient to cover the carrying value of such assets 
this requires the company to make significant judgments about the expected future cash flows of the asset group 
the future cash flows are dependent on general and economic conditions and are subject to change 
a change in these assumptions could result in material charges to income 
during the fiscal year ended may  the company determined that a significant impairment in the value of its amortizable intangible assets and certain of its fixed assets had occurred and recorded a charge to earnings 
recoverability of deferred tax assets the company has generated deferred tax assets and liabilities due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the income tax basis of such assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of the valuation allowances  the company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
at december   the company had valuation allowances of million to offset net deferred tax assets of million 
the valuation allowance was based on the company s assessment that recovery of the deferred tax assets is not likely due to the company s history of generating taxable losses 
in the event the company determines it is likely to be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  the valuation allowance would be reduced  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
accrual of medical malpractice claims the nature of the company s business is such that it is subject to medical malpractice lawsuits 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  the company maintains insurance in the us for individual malpractice claims with a deductible of  per claim and a total annual aggregate deductible of million 
the company is self insured for its operations in canada 
management and the company s insurance carrier review malpractice lawsuits for purposes of establishing ultimate loss estimates 
the company has recorded reserves to cover the estimated costs of the deductible for both reported and unreported medical malpractice claims incurred 
the estimates are based on the average monthly claims expense and the estimated average time lag between the performance of a procedure and notification of a claim 
if the number of claims or the cost of settle claims is higher than the company s historical experience or if the actual time lag varies from the estimated time lag  the company may need to record significant additional expense 
risk factors see item business risk factors 
twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  results from the laservision business are only included for operations subsequent to the date of acquisition in may this merger significantly impacted the variances in results between the twelve months ended december  and due to the completed integration of tlc vision and laservision  it is no longer practical to distinguish revenues or cost of revenues between the two companies 
information for the twelve months ended december  was not audited due to the change in fiscal years 
total revenues for the twelve months ended december  were million  an increase of million  or increase over revenues of million for the twelve months ended december  approximately of total revenues for the twelve months ended december  were derived from refractive services compared to during the twelve months ended december  revenues from the refractive segment for the twelve months ended december  were million  an increase of million or over revenues of million from refractive activities for the twelve months ended december  this increase was largely due to a full year of laservision revenues in offset by the closure of owned  managed and access sites that were underperforming 
revenues from owned centers for the twelve months ended december  were million  an increase of million or from million from the prior year period 
this increase resulted from increased volume largely due to the laservision acquisition and higher revenues associated with custom lasik  offset by lost revenue due to the closure of underperforming centers that were operational during part of the twelve months ended december  revenues from managed centers for the twelve months ended december  were million  an increase of million or from the revenues of million for the twelve months ended december  since laservision did not have a managed service product  the laservision acquisition had no effect on revenues for managed centers 
this increase resulted from growth in active centers and higher prices associated with custom lasik  offset by lost revenue associated with the closure of managed centers that were operational during part of the twelve months ended december  revenues from laser access services for the twelve months ended december  were million  an increase of million from the revenues of million for the twelve months ended december  because laser access is a product offering of laservision only  the company reported no access revenue for the existing tlc vision business prior to the merger in may therefore  the increase in revenue was substantially impacted by prior year revenue only including revenue subsequent to the date of acquisition in may approximately  refractive procedures were performed in the twelve months ended december   compared to approximately  procedures for the twelve months ended december  the increase in procedure volume of  or was largely due to a full year of laservision procedures in and growth in owned and managed centers offset by procedures lost due to underperforming centers that were closed since the laservision acquisition in may the cost of refractive revenues for the twelve months ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  over the cost of refractive revenues of million for the twelve months ended december  this increase was related to the increase in procedure volume and the higher costs associated with custom lasik 
the cost of revenues from owned centers for the twelve months ended december  was million  an increase of million or from the cost of revenues of million from the twelve months ended december  this increase was related to rising costs  specifically due to higher royalty fees and doctor compensation resulting from the introduction of custom lasik 
the cost of revenues from managed centers for the twelve months ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the cost of revenues of million from the twelve months ended december   due to higher procedure volume 
as laservision does not have a managed service product  the laservision acquisition had no effect on the managed center cost of revenue for the year 
the cost of revenues from access services for the twelve months ended december  was million  up million from million subsequent to the laservision merger in may access services are a product offering of laservision only and therefore were significantly impacted by the inclusion of laservision only from the date of acquisition in may during the twelve months ended december   the company recorded million in charges to reflect the reduction in the value of certain capital assets 
no adjustment was recorded in the twelve months ended december  fluctuations in cost of revenue were consistent with significant variable cost changes to doctor compensation  royalty fees on laser usage and personnel and medical supplies that are highly dependent on procedural volume 
the cost of revenues for refractive centers include fixed cost components for infrastructure of personnel  facilities and minimum equipment usage fees which can cause cost of revenues to increase at a slower rate than the percentage increase in the associated revenues 
in addition  most refractive equipment was depreciated using a declining balance method in compared to a declining balance method through may if the company had used a declining method in the prior year  then the depreciation expense for the prior year would have been approximately million higher 
revenues from other healthcare services for the twelve months ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from revenues of million for the twelve months ended december  approximately of the total revenues for the twelve months ended december  were derived from other healthcare services compared to during the twelve months ended december  the increase in revenue reflected the company s stated diversification strategy to increase non refractive eye care services 
revenue increased due to two acquisitions in fiscal  incremental revenue resulting from a full year of business gained in conjunction with the laservision acquisition as the prior year period only included laservision revenue since the date of acquisition in may  and growth in existing businesses 
the cost of revenues from other healthcare services for the twelve months ended december  was million  an increase of million or from cost of revenues of million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in cost of revenues was primarily related to incremental costs incurred resulting from the increased revenue of the other healthcare service business 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december  the million or decrease primarily was a result of the company s cost reduction initiatives and lower legal and accounting fees 
in addition  million was recorded as a reduction in expense related to the partial reversal of an accrual related to a settlement of a lawsuit during fiscal because the company has reduced its overhead cost structure  the combined infrastructure cost of tlc vision and laservision continues to be lower than the overhead cost of tlc prior to the laservision acquisition despite a increase in refractive procedure volume during the twelve months ended december  as a result  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to from compared to the prior year period 
the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue in but at slower rates 
marketing expenses decreased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december  marketing expenses decreased by million  or  despite a full year of marketing expenses related to laservision  whereas the prior year period only included expenses subsequent to the date of acquisition in may marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to during fiscal compared to in the prior year period 
the company anticipates that marketing expenses will remain stable or slightly decrease as a percentage of revenue in amortization expenses decreased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in amortization expense of million was largely a result of the significant impairment charges in that reduced the fair value of practice management agreements and the related ongoing amortization 
research and development expenses of million for the twelve months ended december  decreased by million from million for the twelve months ended december  in conjunction with a recent partnership with diamed medizintechnik gmbh diamed  the company elected to renew its investment commitment to research and development efforts by vascular sciences 
as a result  the company paid million to vascular sciences to further its efforts to achieve fda approval for medical treatments related to dry age related macular degeneration 
since the technology is in the development stage and has not received food and drug administration approval  the company accounted for this investment as a research and development arrangement whereby investments were expensed as amounts are expended by vascular sciences 
if the product becomes commercially available and fda approval is obtained  incremental investments may be recorded as long term assets 
during the twelve months ended december   the company made payments of million to fund research by vascular sciences and paid million to tracey technologies for custom ablation related research and development 
the company s operating results for the twelve months ended december  included a non cash pretax charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company recorded a million charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill for which the carrying value exceeded the fair value  including million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the acquisition of laservision and million for the impairment of goodwill from prior acquisitions 
intangible assets whose useful lives are not indefinite are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable agreement to a maximum of years 
current amortization periods range from five to years 
in establishing these long term contractual relationships with the company  key surgeons in many cases have agreed to receive reduced fees for laser vision correction procedures performed 
the reduction in doctors compensation offsets in part the increased amortization of the intangible practice management agreements 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires long lived assets included within the scope of the statement be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long lived assets might not be recoverable that is  information indicates that an impairment might exist 
given the significant decrease in the trading price of the company s common stock during  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with its history of operating or cash flow losses  the company identified certain practice management agreements where the recoverability was impaired 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million during the twelve months ended december  no impairment charge related to practice management agreements was recorded during fiscal during the twelve months ended december   the company recorded a million reduction in expenses related to the valuation of investments and long term notes receivable 
the company reduced a reserve by million related to a long term receivable due to a consistent payment history and continually improving financial strength of the debtor and wrote down its investment in a marketable equity security by million during the twelve months ended december  due to an other than temporary decline in its value 
the company also recorded a million expense related to adjustments to the value of investments and long term receivables in the twelve months ended december  using similar valuation analyses 
the company recorded million of restructuring charges during the twelve months ended december   primarily relating to the closing of six unprofitable centers 
these charges consist of total charges of million offset by the reversal into income of million of restructuring charges related to prior year accruals that were no longer needed as of december  cash requirements attributable to restructuring costs will be financed through the company s cash and cash equivalents on hand 
a total of million of this provision related to non cash costs of writing down fixed assets  million related to non cash costs of writing off prepaid expenses  investments and laser commitments  million related to severance  and million related to the net future cash costs for lease commitments and costs to sublet available space offset by sub lease income 
the lease costs will be paid out over the remaining term of the lease 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of million during the twelve months ended december   primarily relating to costs associated with closing several unprofitable centers and severance costs incurred in conjunction with the company s cost reduction initiatives plan 
the following table details restructuring charges recorded during the year ended december  accrual balance as of restructuring cash non cash december  charges payments reductions severance lease commitments  net of sub lease income intangible and investment write offs laser commitments write down of fixed assets 
total restructuring charges 
 other income and expense of million for the twelve months ended december  resulted from the gain on sale of assets from previously closed centers and additional proceeds from the settlement of an antitrust lawsuit in during the twelve months ended december   the company recorded million in other revenue  primarily consisting of million of one time income from the settlement of an antitrust lawsuit plus million of income from the termination of the agreement to purchase aspen health care from the company  less million of expense for the loss related to the disposition of lasers 
interest expense  net of million for the twelve months ended december  reflected interest expense from debt and lease obligations partially offset by interest income from the company s cash position 
during fiscal  the company incurred additional interest expense related to new loans obtained to fund future acquisitions and loans associated with the purchase of a significant amount of equipment related both to the introduction of custom lasik in the united states and the expansion of the mss cataract business 
in addition  interest income has decreased since the company has reduced cash and cash equivalent balances during the twelve months ended december  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year and interest rates have declined 
accordingly  interest expense  net increased million from million in the prior year period 
minority interest expense increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december  this million increase represented higher profits reported by the company s subsidiaries in which the company has a shared interest with minority partners  a higher percentage of minority interest payable to partners related to the divestiture of vision source in  and new minority interest related to the purchase of an ambulatory surgery center during income tax expense of million for the twelve month period ended december  decreased million from million for the twelve months ended december  due to the favorable change in the taxable status of two subsidiaries 
the million tax expense consisted of federal and state taxes for certain of the company s subsidiaries where consolidated federal and state tax returns cannot be filed 
net loss for the twelve months ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a loss of million or per share  for the twelve months ended december  the significant improvement in net loss resulted from the contribution of the full year of the laservision business in  growth in both the refractive and other healthcare services businesses  a significant reduction in general and administrative charges and a million reduction in impairment of intangible assets and restructuring charges in fiscal from the prior year period 
seven months ended december  compared to the seven months ended december as used herein  existing tlc vision refers to tlc vision locations in existence prior to the merger with laservision in may information for the seven months ended december  was not audited due to the change in fiscal years 
revenues for the seven months ended december  were million  a million increase over revenues of million for the seven months ended december  the contribution of laservision during the seven month period ended december  added million of revenues while the existing tlc vision revenue decreased by million or 
approximately of total revenues for the seven months ended december were derived from refractive services compared to during the seven months ended december  revenues from the refractive segment for the seven months ended december  were million  an increase of million or  over revenues of million from refractive activities for the seven months ended december  laservision added million of refractive revenues  while the existing tlc vision refractive revenue decreased by million  or 
revenues from owned centers for the seven months ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from the revenues of million for the seven months ended december  laservision accounted for million of such revenues  while the existing tlc vision revenue decreased by million  or 
revenues from managed centers for the seven months ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from the revenues of million for the seven months ended december  as laservision does not have a managed service product  there was no contribution from laservision for the seven months ended december revenues from access services for the seven months ended december  were million 
because access revenues are a product offering of laservision only  the company did not report any associated access revenue in the seven months ended december  for the existing tlc vision business 
approximately  refractive procedures were performed for the seven months ended december   compared to approximately  procedures for the seven months ended december  laservision accounted for  procedures while the tlc vision procedures decreased by  to  the company believes that the reduction in procedure volume was indicative of overall conditions in the laser vision correction industry 
the laser vision correction industry has experienced uncertainty resulting from a number of issues 
being an elective procedure  laser vision correction volumes have been depressed by economic and stock market conditions  rising unemployment and the uncertainty associated with the war on terrorism experienced in north america which reflected in the consumer confidence index 
also contributing to the decline was a wide range in consumer prices for laser vision correction procedures  the bankruptcies of a number of deep discount laser vision correction companies  safety and effectiveness concerns arising from the lack of long term follow up data and negative news stories focusing on patients with unfavorable outcomes from procedures performed at centers competing with the company 
the cost of refractive revenues from eye care centers for the seven months ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  over the cost of refractive revenues of million for the seven months ended december  laservision cost of revenue for was million while the existing tlc vision s cost of revenue decreased by million  or

the cost of revenues from managed centers for the seven months ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from the cost of revenues of million from the seven months ended december  as laservision does not have a managed service product  the company did not report any additional cost from laservision for the seven months ended december  the cost of revenues from access services for the seven months ended december  was million 
access services are a product offering of laservision only  therefore  there was no associated access cost of revenue in the seven months ended december  from the existing tlc vision business 
reductions in cost of revenue were consistent with reduced doctors compensation resulting from lower procedure volumes  reductions in royalty fees on laser usage and reduced personnel costs 
the cost of revenues for refractive centers include a fixed cost component for infrastructure of personnel  facilities and minimum equipment usage fees which has resulted in cost of revenues decreasing at a slower rate than the decrease in the associated revenues 
revenues from other healthcare services for the seven months ended december   were million  an increase of million from revenues of million for the seven months ended december  laservision accounted for million of the increase while the existing tlc vision revenue increased by million  or

although the company has reduced overhead and infrastructure cost as part of the company s cost reduction initiatives  the combined infrastructure cost of tlc vision and laservision was higher than tlc vision incurred by itself during the seven months ended december  marketing expenses decreased to million for the seven months ended december  from million for the seven months ended december  this reflected decreased spending on marketing programs identified in conjunction with the company s cost reduction initiatives 
amortization expenses decreased to million for the seven months ended december  from million for the seven months ended december  the decrease in amortization expense was largely a result of the significant impairment charge in may  which reduced the fair value of pma s and the related ongoing amortization 
research and development expenses reflected million invested in vascular sciences 
since the technology was in the development stage and was not available commercially and had not received food and drug administration approval  the company accounted for this investment as a research and development arrangement whereby investments were expensed as vascular sciences expends amounts 
if the product becomes commercially available  incremental investments may be recorded as long term assets 
the company determined its goodwill was impaired and recorded a charge of million for the seven months ended december  this charge was comprised of million that relates to the goodwill attributable to reporting units acquired in the laservision acquisition and million relating to goodwill attributable to reporting units acquired in prior years 
in addition  the company s adoption of sfas resulted in a transitional impairment loss of million  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the seven months ended december  in december  tlc vision wrote down its investment in a privately held company by million 
that company  which develops an implantable product that corrects and maintains vision is actively seeking additional funding at this time and has received a term sheet from a venture capital firm that indicates significant dilution to the existing shareholders 
tlc vision wrote down the investment to million to reflect the estimated market value of the investment

    other income and expense for the seven months ended december  consisted of million of income from the settlement of an antitrust lawsuit 
in august  laservision received million from its portion of the settlement and tlc vision received million from its portion of the settlement 
the million relating to the activities of laservision represented a contingent asset acquired by the company and was included in the purchase price allocation at may  as an other asset 
the million settlement received related to tlc vision has been recorded as a gain of million net of million for its obligations to be paid to the minority interests in other income and expense for the period

on may   the company agreed to sell the capital stock of its aspen healthcare aspen subsidiary to surgicare inc surgicare for a purchase price of million in cash and warrants for  shares of common stock of surgicare with an exercise price of per share 
on june   the purchase agreement for the transaction was amended due to the failure of surgicare to meet its obligations under the agreement 
the amendment established a new closing date of september  and required surgicare to issue  shares of surgicare common stock and to pay million to the company  prior to closing  all of which was non refundable

the amount is included in other income and expense 
these lasers do not represent the most current technology available and the company made the decision to dispose of them below their carrying cost 
interest expense income  net reflects interest revenue from the company s cash position offset by interest expense from debt and lease obligations 
an increase to debt in the second quarter of fiscal from the corporate headquarters sale leaseback arrangement resulted in additional increases to interest costs 
interest revenues decreased since the company reduced cash and cash equivalent balances during the seven months ended december  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year 
in addition interest yields on cash balances were lower  offset by a gain in foreign currency translation to us dollars related to the company s canadian operations

the loss for the seven months ended december  was million or per share compared to a loss of million or per share for the seven months ended december  this decreased loss primarily reflected the positive impact of the antitrust settlement and cost cutting initiatives partially offset by the reduction in refractive procedures and revenues 
as a result of the laservision acquisition in may  there were more common shares outstanding during the seven months ended december  than in the prior year period 
fiscal year ended may  compared to fiscal year ended may  revenues for fiscal were million  which was a decrease from million for the prior fiscal year 
approximately of total revenues were derived from refractive services in fiscal compared to in fiscal revenues from refractive activities for fiscal were million  which is lower than the prior fiscal year s million 
approximately  procedures were performed in fiscal compared to approximately  procedures in fiscal management believes that the decrease in procedure volume and the associated reduction of revenue was indicative of the overall condition of the laser vision correction industry 
the laser vision correction industry has experienced uncertainty resulting from a wide range in consumer prices for laser vision correction procedures  the bankruptcies of a number of deep discount laser vision correction companies  safety and effectiveness concerns arising from the lack of long term follow up data and negative news stories focusing on patients with unfavorable outcomes from procedures performed at centers competing with tlc vision centers 
in addition  as an elective procedure  laser vision correction volumes were further depressed by economic conditions experienced in north america 
the company maintains its stated objective of being a premium provider of laser vision correction services in an industry that has faced significant pricing pressures 
despite pricing pressures in the industry  the company s net revenue after doctor compensation per procedure for fiscal increased by in comparison to fiscal the increase was largely a result of deep discount surgery providers filing for bankruptcy  thus relieving some of the price pressures that have occurred in prior fiscal years 
revenues from other healthcare services was million in fiscal  an increase of more than in comparison to million in fiscal approximately of total revenues were derived from other healthcare services in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in revenues reflected revenue growth in the network marketing and management and the professional healthcare facility management subsidiaries  while revenues in the secondary care management and asset management subsidiaries reflected little or moderate growth 
cost of revenues from other healthcare services was million in fiscal  an increase of more than in comparison to million in fiscal the increase in cost of revenue reflected the increase in revenue growth in the network marketing and management and the professional healthcare facility management subsidiaries 
the cost of revenues for other healthcare services centers in fiscal included the cost of tlc vision s eyevantange 
com subsidiary 
eyevantage 
com incurred a significant amount of cost without offsetting revenue  thereby resulting in cost of revenues increasing at a lesser rate than the increase in the associated revenues in fiscal net loss from other healthcare services was million in fiscal  in comparison to a net loss of million for fiscal the loss for fiscal included million for the impairment of goodwill and million for the write down of investments in other healthcare services 
the loss for fiscal included the activities of eyevantage 
com  inc  which generated losses of million 
net loss for fiscal did not reflect the activities of eyevantage 
com  inc due to the decision by the company in fiscal to cease material funding of this subsidiary and the resulting decision by eyevantage 
com  inc to abandon its e commerce enterprise 
the profit from other healthcare services for fiscal of million excluding the impairment and investment write downs  reflected an increase from the loss of million for fiscal excluding eyevantage 
com  inc and restructuring costs 
the improved profitability for was due primarily to increased revenues while managing the cost structure thus increasing gross margins 
in the final quarter of fiscal and during fiscal  the company entered into practice management agreements with a number of surgeons resulting in an increase in intangible assets to reflect the value assigned to these agreements 
these intangible assets are amortized over the term of the applicable agreements 
these agreements have resulted  either directly or indirectly  in lower per procedure fees being paid to the applicable surgeons and a corresponding reduction in doctors compensation to offset the increased amortization costs 
the result was an increase to the net revenue after doctors compensation per procedure ratio 
the company s operating results for fiscal included a non cash pre tax charge of million to record the impairment in the carrying value of certain practice management agreements on which the carrying value exceeded the fair value as of may  the cost of refractive revenues from eye care centers for fiscal was million  less than cost of refractive revenues of million in fiscal these reductions were in line with reduced doctors compensation resulting from lower procedure volumes  reductions in royalty fees on laser usage and reduced personnel costs 
these reductions were offset by a reduction in the carrying value of capital assets of million reflecting a reduction in the carrying value of the company s lasersight lasers to and two visx lasers to  each 
these lasers did not represent the most current technology available and the company decided to write the lasers down to current market value and will evaluate the best option for utilization or upgrade of these lasers 
the cost of revenues for refractive centers include a fixed cost component for infrastructure of personnel  facilities and minimum equipment usage fees which resulted in cost of revenues decreasing at a lesser rate for fiscal  as compared to fiscal than the decrease in the associated revenues 
cost of revenues of owned centers include the cost of doctors compensation 
cost of doctor compensation varies in relation to revenues 
accordingly  when combined with the conversion of a number of owned centers to managed centers  the cost of revenues of owned centers reflectsa much larger variance in the decrease in the costs of revenues in comparison to managed centers 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased marketing costs  decreased infrastructure costs and reductions associated with corporate advantage and third party payer programs  each identified in conjunction with the company s cost reduction initiatives 
interest income expense reflects interest revenue from the company s net cash and cash equivalent position 
interest revenue decreased throughout the year as a result of the company s declining cash position and decreasing interest yields 
this decrease also includes an increase in interest expense resulting from additional long term debt and as a result of the sale leaseback transaction of the corporate international headquarters in canada during fiscal depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in the current fiscal year from million in fiscal  primarily as the result of the company s early adoption of sfas  thus eliminating the requirement for the goodwill amortization 
the adoption of this statement resulted in decreased amortization expense of approximately million for fiscal depreciation and amortization expense has also decreased due to fewer capital additions resulting from limited development of new centers and the closure of certain existing centers 
the company s adoption of sfas resulted in a transitional impairment loss of million  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  the company s operating results for fiscal included a non cash pretax charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill for which the carrying value exceeded the fair value as of may   including million related to the impairment of goodwill from the acquisition of laservision and million for the impairment of goodwill from prior acquisitions 
intangible assets whose useful lives are not indefinite are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable agreement to a maximum of years 
current amortization periods range from five to years 
in establishing these long term contractual relationships with the company  key surgeons in many cases have agreed to receive reduced fees for laser vision correction procedures performed 
the reduction in doctors compensation offsets in part the increased amortization of the intangible practice management agreements 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires long lived assets included within the scope of the statement be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long lived assets might not be recoverable that is  information indicates that an impairment might exist 
given the significant decrease in the trading price of the company s common stock during fiscal  current period operating or cash flow loss combined with its history of operating or cash flow losses  the company identified certain practice management agreements where the recoverability was impaired 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million in tlc vision made its first investment in lasersight incorporated lasersight prior to the beginning of fiscal lasersight is a company involved in the research and development of new laser technology 
from the time of purchase through the third quarter of fiscal  the market value of the investment exceeded the carrying value at each quarter end 
however  by november   the company believed that the impairment should be considered other than temporary for a number of reasons including the impairment was very substantial relative to the original purchase price  the impairment had persisted for more than nine months and sufficient time had passed to determine that the market place did not react well to fda approval of lasersight s new technology 
as a result  the company recorded a total impairment charge of million during fiscal with respect to its investment in laservision  tlc vision wrote down its investment in laservision by million in the period prior to the merger  due to an other than temporary decline in its value

a the company continued its objective of reducing employee costs in line with revenues 
this activity occurred in two stages with total charges of million 
the first stage of reductions was identified in the second and third quarters of fiscal and resulted in restructuring charges of million  all of which had been paid out in cash or options by the end of the fiscal year 
this reduction impacted employees  of whom were working in laser centers  with the remaining working within various corporate functions 
the second stage of the cost reduction required the company to identify the impact of its acquisition of laservision on may  and eliminate surplus positions resulting from the acquisition 
the majority of these costs were paid by the end of december b as part of the company restructuring subsequent to its acquisition of laservision in may  six centers were identified for closure such centers were identified based on managements earning criteria  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
these closures resulted in restructuring charges of million reflecting a write down of fixed assets of million and cash costs of million which include net lease commitments net of costs to sublet and sub lease income of million  ongoing laser commitments of million  termination costs of a doctor s contract of million and severance costs impacting center employees of million 
the lease costs will be paid out over the remaining term of the lease 
c the company also identified seven centers where management determined that given the current and future expected procedures  the centers had excess leased capacity or the lease arrangements were not economical 
the company assessed these seven centers to determine whether the excess space should be subleased or whether the centers should be relocated 
the company provided million related to the costs associated with sub leasing the excess or unoccupied facilities 
a total of million of this provision related to non cash costs of writing down fixed assets and million represented net future cash costs for lease commitments and costs to sublet available space offset by sub lease income that is projected to be generated

  total restructuring and other charges      income tax expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease reflected the company s losses incurred in fiscal offset by the impact of the tax liabilities associated with the company s investments in profitable subsidiaries that are less than owned and the requirement to reflect minimum tax liabilities relevant in canada  the united states and certain other jurisdictions

the loss for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to a loss of million or per share for fiscal this increased loss primarily reflected the impact of reduced refractive revenues  the reduction in carrying values of capital and intangible assets  the reduction in the carrying value of goodwill and the write down of investments offset partially by reduced costs and decreased depreciation and amortization
