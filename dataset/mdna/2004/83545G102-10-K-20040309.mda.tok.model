item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the sonic automotive  inc and subsidiaries consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
overview we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states 
as of march  we operated dealership franchises  representing different brands of cars and light trucks  at locations and collision repair centers in states 
our dealerships provide comprehensive services including sales of both new and used cars and light trucks  sales of replacement parts  performance of vehicle maintenance  warranty  paint and collision repair services  and arrangement of extended warranty contracts  financing and insurance for our customers 
in addition  although vehicle sales are cyclical and are affected by many factors  including general economic conditions  consumer confidence  levels of discretionary personal income  interest rates and available credit  our parts  service and collision repair services are not closely tied to vehicle sales and are not dependent upon near term sales volume 
as a result  we believe the diversity of these products and services reduces the risk of periodic economic downturns 
the automobile industry s total amount of new vehicles sold decreased by to million vehicles in from million vehicles in this was the third consecutive annual decrease in industry sales and the lowest total since many factors such as brand and geographic concentrations have caused our past results to differ from the industry s total amount of new vehicles sold 
however  in our stores generally outperformed the industry s import unit sales growth and underperformed the industry s domestic sales contraction of 
on a regional basis  approximately of our franchises expanded their respective market share in as compared to based on manufacturers data 

table of contents the following table depicts the breakdown of our new vehicle revenues by brand for each of the past three years percentage of new vehicle revenues year ended december  brand honda toyota cadillac general motors ford bmw lexus volvo chrysler mercedes nissan other luxury other total in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 adopted january   revenue data in prior years reflect the reclassification of the results of operations of all dealerships sold during and or held for sale as of december  to discontinued operations includes buick  chevrolet  gmc  oldsmobile  saturn and pontiac includes chrysler  dodge and jeep includes acura  audi  bentley  hummer  infiniti  land rover  maybach  porsche  rolls royce and saab includes hino  hyundai  isuzu  kia  lincoln  mercury  minicooper  mitsubishi  scion  subaru and volkswagen we sell similar products and services that exhibit similar economic characteristics  use similar processes in selling our products and services and sell our products and services to similar classes of customers 
as a result of this and the way we manage our business  we have aggregated our operating segments into a single segment for purposes of reporting financial condition and results of operations 
in the ordinary course of business we evaluate our dealership franchises for possible disposition based on various performance criteria 
during the year ended december   we disposed of franchises  terminated four franchises  and had approved  but not completed  the disposition of additional franchises 
these franchises are generally franchises with unprofitable operations 
we believe the sale of these dealerships will allow us to focus our management attention on those remaining stores with the highest potential return on investment 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the most subjective and complex judgments 
following is a discussion of what we believe are our critical accounting policies and estimates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our accounting policies 
finance and service contracts we arrange financing for customers through various financial institutions and receive a commission from the lender either in a flat fee amount or in an amount equal to the difference between the actual interest rates charged to customers and the predetermined base rates set by the financing institution 
we also receive commissions from the sale of various insurance contracts and non recourse third party extended service contracts to customers 
under these contracts  the applicable manufacturer or third party warranty company is directly liable for all warranties provided within the contract 

table of contents in the event a customer terminates a financing  insurance or warranty contract prior to the original termination date  we may be required to return a portion of the commission revenue originally recorded to the third party provider chargebacks 
the commission revenue for the sale of these products and services is recorded net of estimated chargebacks at the time of sale 
our estimate of future chargebacks is established based on our historical chargeback rates  termination provisions of the applicable contracts  and industry data 
while chargeback rates vary depending on the type of contract sold  a basis point increase in the estimated chargeback rates used in determining our estimates of future chargebacks would have increased our estimated reserve for chargebacks at december  by million 
our estimate of chargebacks million as of december  is influenced by early contract termination events such as vehicle repossessions  refinancings and early pay off 
if these factors change  the resulting impact is a change in our estimate for chargebacks 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment might have occurred 
based on criteria established by the applicable accounting pronouncements  we allocate the carrying value of goodwill and test it for impairment based on our geographic divisions 
the million of goodwill on our balance sheet  including approximately million classified in assets held for sale  at december  is allocated to the following geographic divisions dollars in millions northern division southeastern division central division western division in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we compare the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to each division to the fair value of the underlying dealerships in each division 
this represents the first step of the impairment test 
if the fair value of a division is less than the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to that division  we are then required to proceed to the second step of the impairment test 
the second step involves allocating the calculated fair value to all of the identifiable intangible assets of the respective division as if the calculated fair value was the purchase price of the business combination 
this allocation would include assigning value to any previously unrecognized identifiable assets which means the fair value that would be allocated to goodwill is significantly reduced 
see discussion regarding franchise agreements acquired prior to july  in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we then compare the value of the goodwill resulting from this allocation process to the carrying value of the goodwill in the respective division with the difference representing the amount of impairment 
we use several assumptions and various fair value approaches in estimating the fair value of the goodwill in each division 
these assumptions and approaches include an earnings multiple for private dealership valuations as determined by the historical multiple paid for dealerships we have purchased applied to actual earnings  an earnings multiple for public consolidators in our peer group applied to actual earnings  and a discounted cash flow utilizing estimated future earnings and our weighted average cost of capital 
these approaches are blended  with an emphasis on the private dealership valuation  to arrive at a fair value of goodwill for each division 
at december  the date of our latest impairment test  the fair value of each of our divisions exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to them step one of the impairment test 
as a result  we were not required to conduct the second step of the impairment test described above  and we recognized no impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill on our balance sheet at december  however  if in future periods we determine that the fair value of the goodwill allocated to one or more of our divisions is less than the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to such division s  we believe that application of the second step of the impairment test would result in a substantial impairment charge to the goodwill allocated to such division s because of the inherent nature of the allocation process  and the amount of such impairment charge would very likely be material to our consolidated operating results  financial position and cash flows 
insurance reserves we have various self insured and high deductible insurance programs which require us to make estimates in determining the ultimate liability we may incur for claims arising under these programs 
these insurance reserves are estimated by management using actuarial evaluations based on historical claims experience  claims processing procedures  medical cost trends and  in certain cases  a discount factor 
we estimate the ultimate liability under these programs is between million and million 
at december   we had million reserved for such programs 
we used an experience modification factor in estimating reserves for workers compensation claims of 
a change of five basis points in this factor would change the reserve by  we also used a discount rate of to calculate the present value of our estimated workers compensation claims 
a change of basis points in the discount rate would change the reserve by approximately  a discount rate of is also used to calculate the present value of our general liability claim reserves 
a change of basis points in the discount 
table of contents rate would have changed the reserve by approximately  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million relating to self insurance reserves on a general liability insurance program going back to legal proceedings we are involved  and will continue to be involved  in numerous legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business  including litigation with customers  employment related lawsuits  contractual disputes and actions brought by governmental authorities 
currently  no legal proceedings are pending against or involve us that  in the opinion of management  could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and prospects 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and operation of the asset  whether owned or leased 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated operating results  financial position  or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires the recognition of a liability for certain guarantees issued or modifications to existing guarantees after december  and clarifies disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
the adoption of fin no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows 
in january  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting by a customer for certain consideration received from a vendor 
in accordance with issue no 
 which was effective january   payments received from manufacturers for floor plan assistance and certain types of advertising allowances should be recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory and recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold 
previous practice was to recognize such payments as a reduction of cost of sales at the time of vehicle purchase 
the cumulative effect of the adoption of issue no 
resulted in a decrease to income of million  net of applicable income taxes of million  for had the guidance from issue no 
been retroactively applied  results of operations and net income per share for the years and would not have been materially different from the previously reported results 
in july  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  application of issue no 
by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers 
issue requires certain consideration offered directly from manufacturers to consumers to be recorded as a reduction of cost of sales 
issue will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the provisions of issue and have not determined the impact on our consolidated operating results  financial position and cash flows 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes the percentages of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income 
percentage of total revenues for the year ended december  revenues new vehicles used vehicles wholesale vehicles parts  service and collision repair finance and insurance and other total revenues cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation goodwill amortization operating income interest expense  floor plan interest expense  other other expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense net income from continuing operations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 revenue data in prior years reflect the reclassification of the results of operations of all dealerships sold during and or held for sale as of december  to discontinued operations during the year ended december   we disposed of franchises  terminated four franchises  and had approved  but not completed  the disposition of additional franchises 
the results of operations of these dealerships  including gains or losses on disposition  have been included in discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
in addition to these dispositions  during the years ended december  and  we disposed of and franchises  respectively 
however  because the provisions of sfas no 
do not permit retroactive application to dispositions occurring before january   the results of operations of the dealerships sold prior to january  have been included in income from continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
as a result  a comparison of the results of operations based on the information presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of income is not meaningful since the information presented for includes results of operations for dealerships disposed in that year that were not in existence in subsequent years 
therefore  in order to provide a more meaningful comparison  the tables included within the discussion below disaggregate the impact of the dealerships disposed in in order to arrive at a comparison of only the results of operations of ongoing operations 
annual same store results of operations represent the aggregate of the same store results for each quarter 
same store results for each quarter include dealerships that were owned and operated for the entire quarter in both periods 
new vehicles new vehicle revenues include both the sale and lease of new vehicles  as well as the sale of fleet vehicles 
new vehicle revenues are highly dependent on manufacturer incentives  which vary from cash back incentives to low interest rate financing 
new vehicle revenues are also dependent on manufacturers for adequate vehicle allocations to meet customer demands 
the automobile manufacturing industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
as an automotive retailer  we seek to mitigate the effects of this cyclicality by maintaining a diverse mix of domestic and import branded dealerships 
our brand diversity allows us to offer a broad range of products at a wide range of prices from lower priced  or economy vehicles  to luxury vehicles 
we believe that this diversity reduces the risk of changes in customer preferences  product supply shortages and aging products 
for the year ended december   of our total new vehicle revenue was generated by import luxury dealerships compared to for we expect this trend toward more import luxury dealerships to continue in the near future 

table of contents we believe demographic and other trends favor luxury and near luxury brands and expect our acquisition activity in the near future to concentrate primarily  but not completely  on these brands 
during the first quarter of  we completed the acquisition of one toyota and one lexus dealership 
during the second quarter of  we expect to close on the acquisition of a group of primarily import luxury dealerships in the houston market 
after completion of these acquisitions  the percentage of new vehicle revenues from import luxury is expected to be approximately 
we expect that industry wide new vehicle sales will continue their overall long term trend of growing modestly faster than population growth after considering the impact of normal business cycles 
we also believe the trend toward ownership of more vehicles per household will continue 
for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total new vehicle units same store acquisitions and other total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total new vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions and other total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total new vehicle unit price same store total ongoing dealerships during  total same store new vehicle unit sales remained relatively flat because of offsetting increases in our import dealerships and decreases in our domestic dealerships 
our import dealerships experienced increases of  units  or  as compared to this is compared to an industry increase in unit sales at import dealerships generally of 
our toyota  honda  and volvo dealerships experienced growth of  units  or   units  or  and units  or  respectively  during these increases can be primarily attributed to the introduction of new models and new body styles for existing models 
on a geographic basis  our strongest performing regions were san diego nevada up  north carolina south carolina up and northern california up  all of which have a high concentration of import and or luxury brands 
our domestic dealerships experienced unit sales declines of  units  or  during this is compared to an industry decrease in unit sales at domestic dealerships of 
our ford dealerships were responsible for of the domestic decline due primarily to ford s continued loss of market share to import brands 
also  the central division which consists of the dallas  houston  oklahoma and colorado regions experienced decreases of  units  or  as compared to  because of a concentration of domestic dealerships and local economic factors such as unusually high unemployment rates compared to the national average 
our gm  excluding cadillac  and chrysler dealerships were responsible for the remainder of our domestic decline  experiencing decreases of  units  or  and units  or  respectively 
all of our dealerships except bmw and toyota stores experienced sales price per unit increases during our honda  cadillac  volvo and lexus dealerships experienced the most significant price increases due to an increase in truck and sport utility vehicle sales 
however  the average price per unit at our bmw dealerships decreased because of increased competition in the luxury sport utility vehicle market 
the average price per unit at our toyota dealerships remained relatively flat 
the decline in our same store unit sales during the year ended december  was consistent with an industry wide decline in new vehicle sales 
this decline was particularly evident in domestic brands  which are generally more sensitive to economic conditions than import and luxury brands 
sales at our domestic  non luxury dealerships declined approximately for the year ended december  and accounted for approximately of the total decline in same store unit sales 
regional performance was negatively affected by weaker economic conditions in our northern california and dallas regions 
same store unit sales in those regions declined by  units  or  and  units  or  respectively  as compared to these decreases were partially offset by increases in unit sales in regions with a predominance of import and luxury dealerships  primarily san diego nevada  where units sales increased  units  or  and georgia tennessee  where units sales increased units  or  compared to used vehicles used vehicle revenues are directly affected by the level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  the number and quality of trade ins and lease turn ins and the availability of consumer credit 
in addition  various manufacturers provide franchised 
table of contents dealers the opportunity to certify pre owned vehicles cpo vehicles based on criteria established by the manufacturer 
this certification process extends the standard manufacturer warranty 
we believe the extended manufacturer warranty increases our potential to retain the pre owned purchaser as a future parts and service customer 
we believe the used vehicle business will become more clearly segmented and cpo vehicles and similar products will become a larger share of dealership used vehicle sales 
our unit sales of cpo vehicles increased to  units in from  units in  a increase 
for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total used vehicle units same store acquisitions and other total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total used vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions and other total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total used vehicle unit price same store total ongoing dealerships during  the used vehicle market faced challenging conditions arising from the continuation of significant manufacturer incentives on new vehicles and a lack of sub prime credit availability 
the central division was most adversely affected by these factors due to a greater dependence on used vehicle sales than our other divisions 
this division accounted for of our total same store used unit decline in the available credit in the sub prime category has declined due to certain national lenders reducing their exposure in this area and other lenders increasing their credit standards 
we have begun to reduce the effect of the sub prime credit market s tightening by utilizing regional finance sources to replace the national lenders and by increasing the number of units that we finance through our wholly owned sub prime lending company  cornerstone acceptance 
the declines in used unit sales generated in the central division were partially offset by increases in unit sales volume in the san diego nevada up and ohio up regions 
during  used vehicle unit sales were negatively affected by the manufacturer incentives and credit availability issues discussed above 
same store unit sales in oklahoma declined  units  or 
also  unit sales in our southeast division declined  units  or 
these regions accounted for of the total decline in same store unit sales for wholesale vehicles wholesale vehicle revenues are highly correlated with new and used vehicle retail sales and the associated trade in volume 
wholesale revenues are also significantly affected by our corporate inventory management policies which are designed to optimize our total used vehicle inventory 

table of contents for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total wholesale vehicle units same store acquisitions and other total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total wholesale vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions and other total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total wholesale unit price same store total ongoing dealerships during  the decrease in same store wholesale vehicle revenues was due to a decrease in retail units sold in our domestic dealerships 
our domestic dealerships total new and used retail units decreased  units  or  thus there were fewer cars available for trade in 
therefore  there were fewer cars that required wholesaling 
conversely  our import dealerships wholesale unit sales remained flat  while import dealerships retail unit sales increased 
this was the result of more effective sales practices as compared to our domestic dealerships 
during  the decrease in same store wholesale vehicle revenues was due to a decrease in units sold  offset by an increase in average price per unit  primarily resulting from wholesaling higher end models in order to liquidate aged units and maintain appropriate inventory levels 
parts  service and collision repair parts and service revenue consists of customer requested repairs customer pay  warranty repairs  retail parts  wholesale parts and collision repairs 
same store revenue from these items was as follows for the year ended change change for the year ended change change service parts collision repair service revenue is driven by the mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs  available service capacity  customer satisfaction levels  vehicle quality and manufacturer warranty programs 
during  of our service and parts revenue was generated by warranty repairs and by customer pay repairs compared to by warranty repairs and by customer pay repairs in we believe that  over time  vehicle quality will improve but that vehicle complexity will offset any revenue lost from improvement in vehicle quality 
we also believe we have the ability  through our access to capital  to continue to add service capacity and increase revenues 
in addition  manufacturers continue to extend new vehicle warranty periods and have also begun to include regular maintenance items in the warranty coverage 
these factors  combined with the extended manufacturer warranties on cpo vehicles see the discussion in business business strategy certified pre owned vehicles above  should allow continued growth in our service and parts business 
parts revenue is driven by the mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs as prices for warranty parts are established by the manufacturer 
we believe that long term trends in retail parts sales will be affected by the same trends as discussed above for service additional capacity  customer satisfaction  etc one of the key metrics we use to analyze the profitability of our fixed operations business is fixed absorption 
this metric represents the percentage of a dealership s fixed costs which are covered by the operating profit of the service  parts  and collision 
table of contents repair departments 
our fixed absorption rate was in compared to in we believe that we substantially exceed the industry s average fixed absorption rate 
as of december   we operated collision repair centers 
collision revenues are heavily impacted by trends in the automotive insurance industry 
over the last few years collision repair revenues have either declined or remained flat because customers are choosing higher deductible policies  thus choosing not to make minor repairs that were previously covered by lower deductible policies 
also  insurance companies generally are declaring more vehicles totaled in recent years  thus the vehicles do not need to be repaired 
for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total parts  service and collision repair in thousands same store acquisitions and other total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported same store parts  service  and collision repair revenues increased during  primarily from the strong performance of our import dealerships 
our honda and bmw dealerships experienced increases in parts and service revenues of million  or and million  or  respectively  compared to increases in our import dealerships were primarily attributable to warranty work as import manufacturers continue to extend warranty periods and include regular maintenance items as part of their new vehicle manufacturer warranty 
warranty sales at our import dealerships increased million  or 
these import increases were partially offset by decreases in our domestic dealerships  which declined million  or  compared to domestic dealerships parts and service revenues were largely impacted by our ford stores which experienced declines of million  or  compared to the declines in our ford dealerships were primarily caused by a decrease in wholesale parts sales of million  or  because of ford motor company s decision to open a parts depot in the houston area in the second half of near a sonic wholesale parts operation 
also  warranty sales at our ford stores experienced declines of million  or  as compared to same store collision revenues increased slightly due to greater capacity and the relocation of an existing collision center to a new stand alone location 
during  same store parts  service  and collision revenues increased as a result of increased warranty sales at our bmw and honda dealerships 
in addition  we continued implementation of our best practices and investments in real estate and construction projects on collision facilities  which allowed us to increase our overall service and parts capacity 
these increases were partially offset by significant declines in our ford stores of million  or  resulting from unusually high parts and service sales generated in by the firestone tire recall and other recalls 
in addition  collision revenues were adversely affected by rising insurance premiums that have caused consumers to obtain higher deductible policies 
lower collision revenues in were a result of customers choosing not to perform minor repair work that historically would have been covered by lower deductible policies  as well as a change in insurance company trends whereby vehicles are being declared totaled rather than repaired at a greater percentage than in prior years 
finance  insurance and other finance and insurance revenues include commissions for arranging vehicle financing and insurance and also sales of third party extended warranties for vehicles 
in connection with vehicle financing  warranty and insurance contracts  we receive a commission from the provider for originating the contract 
finance and insurance revenues are driven by the level of new and used vehicle sales  manufacturer financing or leasing incentives and our finance and insurance penetration rate 
the penetration rate represents the percentage of vehicle sales on which we are able to originate financing or sell warranty or insurance contracts 
our finance penetration rate increased from to in from in our service contract penetration rate decreased to in from in we expect our finance and insurance penetration rate to increase over time as we continue to emphasize the sale of extended warranty contracts and other products 
in addition  our penetration rate on guaranteed asset protection gap insurance products increased to in from in this is an insurance policy which reimburses the owner of a vehicle for the deficiency between insurance proceeds and the principal owed on the vehicle financing in the event the vehicle is totaled 
we expect sales of gap insurance to continue to increase to the extent the equity in customer trade in vehicles continues to decline 

table of contents for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total finance insurance revenue in thousands same store acquisitions and other total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total f i per unit same store total ongoing dealerships same store finance and insurance revenues decreased during primarily due to lower used vehicle unit sales 
domestic dealerships  concentrated in our central division  represented the majority of the decline due to their dependence on used vehicle sales 
finance and insurance revenues in the central division declined million  or in within the central division  dallas and oklahoma experienced declines of million  or  and million  or  respectively  compared to these declines were partially offset by increases in our regions that are dominated by import and luxury brands 
our san diego nevada and north carolina south carolina regions experienced finance and insurance revenue increases during of million  or  and million  or  respectively 
additionally  our volvo stores experienced significant revenue increases of million  or  compared to same store finance and insurance revenues decreased during primarily due to lower retail vehicle unit sales 
unit sales were negatively impacted by the decline in retail vehicle unit sales in our northern california  dallas  ohio  and north carolina south carolina regions 
finance and insurance revenues in these markets declined million  or  million  or  million  or  and million  or  respectively  compared to these declines were offset by strong performance in our san diego nevada region  driven by a higher import and luxury brand mix  where revenues increased million  or compared to gross profit and gross margins our overall gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues gross margin generally vary depending on changes in our revenue mix 
although sales of new vehicles comprise the majority of our total revenues  new vehicles generally carry the lowest margin of any product or service we offer 
due to the high volume of new vehicle sales  a change in our revenue mix does have a significant impact on our overall gross margin percentage 
retail sales of used vehicles generally carry a slightly higher gross margin than new vehicles 
parts  service  and collision repair carry the next highest margin 
for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total gross profit in thousands same store acquisitions and other total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported 
table of contents the overall gross margin on our various revenue lines on a same store basis were as follows for the year ended for the year ended basis point change basis point change new vehicles used vehicles retail wholesale vehicles parts  service and collision repair finance insurance overall gross margin the overall same store gross margin percentage declined to in from in  primarily due to continued pressure on new and used retail vehicle margins 
our overall gross margin also declined due to the fact that a higher percentage of our total revenues are being generated by new vehicle sales which have the lowest gross margin of all our business lines 
on a same store basis  new vehicle revenue grew to of our total revenue in from in we expect this trend to continue as new vehicle selling prices continue to increase 
this was offset somewhat by the fact that the percentage of revenue contributed by parts  service  and collision repair increased to in from in due to the fact that some manufacturers have extended warranty periods on certain models and the increasing trend of certain manufacturers to include regular maintenance items in their new vehicle standard warranty 
the percentage of revenue contributed by finance and insurance revenues remained flat at 
new vehicle gross margins decreased to in from in  due to an effort on our part to increase market share and maintain appropriate inventory levels 
we believe an emphasis on increasing our market share is advantageous for certain brands because it helps maintain a positive relationship with the manufacturer as we meet their unit volume expectations and provides the potential for future higher margin parts and service business as those new vehicle purchasers have the opportunity to return to our dealerships for repair and maintenance work 
we evaluate our market share strategy based on both brand and the local market in which the dealership operates 
used vehicle margin percentage decreased to in from in  because of a tightening of inventory management policies  new vehicle incentives and a shortage of quality trade ins and lease turn ins 
these retail vehicle decreases were slightly offset by a favorable decrease in the wholesale loss percentage to in from in declining vehicle margins were partially offset by an increase in the parts  service  and collision margin percentage to in from in during  the same store gross margin percentage increased to in from in we experienced an increase over in the percentage of revenues contributed by parts  service and collision repair services to from 
in addition  the gross profit percentage earned on our parts  service  and collision repair services increased to in from in this was offset by an increase in the percentage of revenue contributed by new vehicle sales to in from in also the new vehicle gross margin percentage declined to in from in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised of four major groups compensation expenses  advertising expense  operating rent and rent related expense  and other expense 
compensation expense primarily relates to dealership personnel who are paid a commission or a modest salary plus commission which typically varies depending on gross profits realized and support personnel who are paid a salary plus bonus commission 
due to the salary component of dealership personnel s compensation  gross profits and compensation expense are not correlated 
advertising expense and other expense vary based on the level of actual or anticipated business activity and number of dealerships owned 
rent and rent related expense typically vary with the number of dealerships and franchises owned  investments made for facility improvements and interest rates 
although not completely correlated  we believe the best way to measure sg a expenses is as a percentage of gross profit 
for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total sg a in thousands same store acquisitions and other total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total sg a expenses as a percentage of gross profit increased to in from in these increases were driven primarily by sales compensation expense  advertising expense and rent and rent related expense 

table of contents in and  compensation expense comprised and  respectively  of total sg a expense and and  respectively  of gross profits 
compensation expense in has risen as a percentage of gross profits due to declines in gross margin rates at our domestic dealerships in as well as increases in sales compensation spending levels 
we estimate that of the overall increase of million in sales compensation expense in  million was due to the change in gross profit volume and million was due to an increase in absolute spending levels 
some of the increase in sales compensation expense was offset by reductions in support personnel compensation  which was reduced to million in from million in during  we are implementing standard compensation plans in order to consistently manage sales compensation expense 
we believe this will more clearly correlate sales compensation expense with gross profit and make this expense item more of a variable cost 
advertising expense in and comprised and  respectively  of total sg a expenses 
in  advertising expense increased million compared to of this increase  we estimate that million was due to the change in gross profit volume and million was due to an increase in absolute spending levels 
beginning in  we have centralized the advertising budgeting process which we believe will reduce advertising spending in the future 
rent and rent related expense in and comprised and  respectively  of total sg a 
rent and rent related expense increased million in compared to of this increase  million was related to facilities owned in the prior year where we completed facility improvement projects and million of the increase was due to dealership acquisitions 
our total sg a expenses from ongoing dealerships as a percentage of gross profit of increased from a level of primarily due to increased compensation costs  advertising spending and other expenses 
increases in compensation costs were realized due to above average costs related to the addition of the massey dealerships acquired in march and additional incentives designed to increase sales volume and achieve optimal inventory levels 
advertising expense as a percentage of gross profits from ongoing dealerships increased to in from in due to additional spending in the first half of in order to stimulate consumer traffic 
other expenses increased as a percentage of gross profits from ongoing dealerships to in from in these expenses increased primarily due to investments in regional and divisional management personnel in advance of acquisitions in order to support growth and integration plans

this decrease was offset by an increase in floor plan balances 
the average floor plan balance increased to million during from million during  resulting in an increase in expense of approximately million 
approximately million of the increase in the average floor plan balance was due to additional dealerships we acquired in the average floor plan interest rate incurred by continuing dealerships was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   which reduced interest expense by approximately million 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in floor plan balances during the average floor plan balance increased to million during from million during  resulting in an increase in expense of approximately million 
our floor plan expenses are substantially offset by amounts received from manufacturers in the form of floor plan assistance

the fixed swaps each have a notional principal amount of million and mature on october  and june   respectively 
under the terms of the first swap agreement  we receive interest payments on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one month libor rate  adjusted monthly  and make interest payments at a fixed rate of

liquidity and capital resources we require cash to finance acquisitions and fund debt service and working capital requirements 
we rely on cash flows from operations  borrowings under our various credit facilities and offerings of debt and equity securities to meet these requirements 
because the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries  the majority of our cash flows from operations is generated by these subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flows and ability to service debt depends to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries and their ability to provide us with cash 
uncertainties in the economic environment as well as uncertainties associated with the ultimate resolution of geopolitical conflicts may therefore affect our overall liquidity 
a significant portion of our cash flow is used to acquire additional dealerships 
following is a summary of acquisition activity in recent years in millions subsequent year revenues cash portion of purchase price net of cash acquired acquisitions acquisitions acquisitions acquisitions over the years we have targeted a long term debt to total capital ratio of 
that ratio has consistently stayed in the range of approximately to depending on the timing of our dealership acquisitions 
we expect to reduce our acquisition activity to approximately of annual revenues 
we believe this will allow us to reduce our targeted debt to total capital ratio to by the end of and to over the long term 
our long term debt structure consists of the revolving facility due in and various senior subordinated notes due in and  which are discussed in more detail below 
we believe the combination of cash flows from operations  and the availability under our revolving facility approximately million at december  is sufficient to fund both our working capital needs and the targeted acquisition level discussed above 
floor plan facilities we finance all of our new and certain of our used vehicle inventory through standardized floor plan facilities with chrysler financial company  llc chrysler financial  ford motor credit company ford credit  general motors acceptance corporation gmac  toyota motor credit corporation toyota credit and bank of america  na these floor plan facilities bear interest at variable rates based on prime and libor 
the weighted average interest rate for all our floor plan facilities was for and for during the first quarter of  we expect to add two additional banks as floor plan financing sources 
our floor plan interest expense is substantially offset by amounts received from manufacturers  in the form of floor plan assistance 
in accordance with guidance from eitf issue no 
 floor plan assistance received is capitalized in inventory and charged against cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold 
in  we received approximately million in manufacturer assistance  which resulted in an effective borrowing rate under our floor plan facilities of 
interest payments under 
table of contents each of our floor plan facilities are due monthly and we are generally not required to make principal repayments prior to the sale of the vehicles 
long term debt and credit facilities the revolving facility at december  our revolving facility with ford credit  chrysler financial  bank of america  na and toyota credit had a borrowing limit of million  subject to a borrowing base calculated on the basis of our receivables  inventory and equipment and a pledge of certain additional collateral by one of our affiliates the borrowing base was approximately million at december  
the amounts outstanding under the revolving facility bore interest during at percentage points above libor 
the revolving facility includes an annual commitment fee equal to of the unused portion of the revolving facility 
the total outstanding balance was approximately million as of december  balances under our revolving facility are guaranteed by our operating domestic subsidiaries 
the revolving facility expires on october  two additional banks have agreed to commit million to our revolving facility which will increase the borrowing limit to million 
we expect this increase to close in the first quarter of senior subordinated and notes on august   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the net proceeds  before expenses  of approximately million together with an advance from revolving facility  were used to redeem all of the senior subordinated notes due the notes for million which included accrued but unpaid interest and the redemption premium of on september  a resulting loss of million  which includes the redemption premium  and the write off of unamortized discounts and deferred debt issuance costs is included in other income expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the notes are unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness  mature on august  and are redeemable at our option after august  the redemption premiums for the twelve month periods beginning august of the years  and are  and  respectively 
in addition  up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes may be redeemed on or before august  with net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings 
our obligations under the notes are guaranteed by our operating domestic subsidiaries 
before the notes were redeemed  both the notes and the notes were outstanding 
prior to the redemption of the notes  we applied net proceeds from the sale of the notes to temporarily repay amounts outstanding under our revolving facility and invested in short term fixed income securities 
on november  we issued an additional million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the net proceeds  before expenses  were approximately million  and were used to pay down our revolving facility 
this million issuance contains the same provisions and terms as the million issuance on august  convertible senior subordinated notes on may   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due the convertibles with net proceeds  before expenses  of approximately million 
the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under our revolving facility 
the convertibles are unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness  mature on may   and are redeemable at our option after may  our obligations under the convertibles are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries 
the convertibles are convertible into shares of class a common stock  at the option of the holder  if as of the last day of the preceding fiscal quarter  the closing sale price of our class a common stock for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of such preceding fiscal quarter is more than of the conversion price per share of class a common stock on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter 
if this condition is satisfied  then the convertibles will be convertible at any time  at the option of the holder  through maturity 
the initial conversion price per share is  which is subject to adjustment for certain distributions on  or changes in our class a common stock  if any  prior to the conversion date 
in addition  on or before may   a holder also may convert their convertibles into shares of our class a common stock at any time after a consecutive trading day period in which the average of the trading day prices for the convertibles for that trading day period is less than of the average conversion value for the convertibles during that period 
the conversion value is equal to the product of the closing sale price for our class a common stock on a given day multiplied by the then current conversion rate  which is the number of shares of class a common stock into which each  principal amount of convertibles is then convertible 
none of the conversion features were triggered in the mortgage facility we have a revolving real estate and construction the construction loan and mortgage refinancing the permanent loan line of credit with toyota credit collectively  the mortgage facility 
under the construction loan  our dealership development subsidiaries can borrow up to million to finance land acquisition and dealership construction costs 
advances can be made under the construction loan until november all advances will mature 
table of contents on december   bear interest at percentage points above libor and are secured by our guarantee and a lien on all of the borrowing subsidiaries real estate and other assets 
under the permanent loan  we can refinance up to million in advances under the construction loan once the projects are completed and can finance real estate acquisition costs to the extent these costs were not previously financed under the construction loan 
advances can be made under the permanent loan until december all advances under the permanent loan mature on december   bear interest at above libor and are secured by the same collateral given under the construction loan 
the mortgage facility allows us to borrow up to million in the aggregate under the construction loan and the permanent loan 
the mortgage facility is not cross collateralized with the revolving facility  however  a default under one will cause a default under the other 
we were in compliance with all of the restrictive and financial covenants on all of our floor plan and long term debt facilities at december  payable to our chairman in  we repaid the million payable to our chairman 
dealership acquisitions and dispositions during  we acquired dealerships  representing franchises for a combined purchase price of million in cash 
the total purchase price for the acquisitions was based on our internally determined valuation of the dealerships and their assets 
the cash utilized for these acquisitions was financed by cash generated from our existing operations and by borrowings under our revolving facility 
during  we disposed of franchises and terminated franchises  resulting in the closing of nine dealerships and six collision centers 
these disposals generated cash of million 
in february  we purchased two franchises including goodwill and purchased assets net of notes payable floor plan advances for approximately million 
in addition  we have entered into agreements to purchase nine franchises 
the acquisitions of the nine franchises are expected to close in the second quarter of and will be paid for in cash 
the estimated purchase price for these franchises including goodwill and purchased assets net of notes payable floor plan advances is million 
sale leaseback transactions in an effort to generate additional cash flow  we typically seek to structure our operations to minimize the ownership of real property 
as a result  facilities either constructed by us or obtained in acquisitions are typically sold to third parties in sale leaseback transactions 
the resulting leases generally have initial terms of years and include a series of five year renewal options 
we have no continuing obligations under these arrangements other than lease payments 
the majority of our sale leaseback transactions are completed with cars 
in  we sold million in dealership properties in sale leaseback transactions 
there were no material gains or losses on these sales 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures include the construction of new dealerships and collision repair centers  building improvements and equipment purchased for use in our dealerships 
capital expenditures in were approximately million  of which approximately million related to the construction of new dealerships and collision repair centers and real estate acquired in connection with such construction 
once completed  these new dealerships and collision repair centers are generally sold in sale leaseback transactions 
capital expenditures incurred during expected to be sold within a year in sale leaseback transactions were million 
we do no expect any significant gains or losses from these sales 
as of december   commitments for facilities construction projects totaled approximately million 
we expect million of this amount to be financed through future sale leaseback transactions 
stock repurchase program our board of directors has authorized us to expend up to million to repurchase shares of our class a common stock or redeem securities convertible into class a common stock 
in  we repurchased  shares for approximately 
table of contents million which was somewhat offset by proceeds received from the exercise of stock options under stock compensation plans of million 
subsequent to december   we have repurchased an additional  shares of class a common stock for approximately million 
as of march  we had million remaining under our board authorization 
dividends our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend beginning with a dividend of per share for shareholders of record on september   or million  paid october  our board of directors approved a second dividend of per share for shareholders of record on december   or million  which was paid on january  we intend to pay dividends in the future based on available cash flows  covenant compliance and other factors 
cash flows since the majority of our inventories are financed through floor plan notes payable and a significant portion of our receivables represent contracts in transit which are typically funded within ten days of the sale of the vehicle  we are not required to make significant investments in working capital that would negatively impact our operating cash flows 
therefore  our operating cash flows have approximated net income adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  gains and losses on the retirement of debt deferred taxes and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  which was generated primarily by net income adjusted for non cash items 
cash used for investing activities in was million  the majority of which was related to dealership acquisitions and capital expenditures on construction in progress projects offset by proceeds received from dealership dispositions and the sales of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and primarily related to the issuance of million of notes to refinance our million in senior subordinated notes  and the add on offering of million in notes to pay down the revolving facility 
guarantees in accordance with the terms of our operating lease agreements  our dealership subsidiaries  acting as lessees  generally agree to indemnify the lessor from certain liabilities arising as a result of the use of the leased premises  including environmental liabilities and repairs to leased property upon termination of the lease 
in addition  we have generally agreed to indemnify the lessor in the event of a breach of the lease by the lessee 
in accordance with the terms of agreements entered into for the sale of our dealership franchises  we generally agree to indemnify the buyer from certain liabilities and costs arising subsequent to the date of sale  including environmental liabilities and liabilities resulting from the breach of representations or warranties made in accordance with the agreement 
our maximum liability associated with these general indemnifications was million at december  these indemnifications generally expire within a period of one to three years following the date of sale 
the estimated fair value of these indemnifications was not material 
in connection with dealership dispositions  certain of our dealership subsidiaries have assigned or sublet to the buyer their interests in real property leases associated with such dealerships 
in general  the subsidiaries retain responsibility for the performance of certain obligations under such leases  including rent payments  environmental remediation  and repairs to leased property upon termination of the lease  to the extent that the assignee or sublessee does not perform 
while our exposure with respect to environmental remediation and repairs is difficult to quantify  the total estimated rent payments remaining under such leases as of december  is approximately million 
however  in accordance with the terms of the assignment and sublease agreements  the assignees and sublessees have generally agreed to indemnify sonic and its subsidiaries in the event of non performance 
we expect the value of these various guarantees to continue to increase as we dispose of additional dealerships 

table of contents future liquidity outlook our obligations under our existing credit facilities  indentures and leasing programs are as follows amounts in thousands thereafter total floorplan financing long term debt operating lease construction contracts other purchase obligations acquisition purchase commitments total amount represents purchase price of tangible and intangible assets net of notes payable floor plan advances 
we believe our best source of liquidity for future growth remains cash flows generated from operations combined with our availability of borrowings under our floor plan facilities or any replacements thereof  our revolving facility and other credit arrangements 
though uncertainties in the economic environment as well as uncertainties associated with geopolitical conflicts may affect our ability to generate cash from operations  we expect to generate more than sufficient cash flow to fund our debt service and working capital requirements and any seasonal operating requirements  including our currently anticipated internal growth for our existing businesses  for the foreseeable future 
once these needs are met  we may use remaining cash flow to support our acquisition strategy or repurchase shares of our class a common stock or publicly traded debt securities  as market conditions warrant 
seasonality our operations are subject to seasonal variations 
the first and fourth quarters generally contribute less revenue and operating profits than the second and third quarters 
parts and service demand remains more stable throughout the year 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our variable rate floor plan facilities  revolving facility borrowings and other variable rate notes expose us to risks caused by fluctuations in the applicable interest rates 
the total outstanding balance of such variable instruments after considering the effect of our interest rate swaps see below was approximately  million at december  and approximately million at december  a change of basis points in the underlying interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately million in and approximately million in of the total change in interest expense  approximately million in and approximately million in would have resulted from the floor plan notes facilities 
our exposure with respect to floor plan facilities is mitigated by floor plan assistance payments received from manufacturers that are generally based on rates similar to those incurred under our floor plan financing arrangements 
these payments are capitalized as inventory and charged against cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold 
during and  the amounts we recognized from manufacturer floor plan assistance exceeded our floor plan interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
a change in interest rates of basis points would have had an estimated impact on floor plan assistance of approximately million in and million in in addition to our variable rate debt  we also have lease agreements on a portion of our dealership facilities where the monthly lease payment fluctuates based on libor interest rates 
many of our lease agreements have interest rate floors whereby our lease expense would not fluctuate significantly in periods when libor is relatively low 
in order to reduce our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates  we have two separate interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of our libor based variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
the fixed swaps each have a notional principal amount of million and mature on october  and june   respectively 
under the terms of the first swap agreement  we receive interest payments on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one month libor rate  adjusted monthly  and make interest payments at a fixed rate of 
under the terms of the second swap agreement  we receive interest payments on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one month libor rate  adjusted monthly  and make interest payments at a fixed rate of 
incremental interest expense incurred the difference between interest received and interest paid as a result of the fixed swaps was million in and has been included in interest expense  other in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
the fixed swaps have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and  as a result  changes in the fair 
table of contents value of the fixed swaps have been recorded in other comprehensive loss  net of related income taxes  in our statement of stockholders equity 
in  we entered into four separate interest rate swaps each at million and a fifth interest rate swap for million million total to effectively convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to a libor based variable rate debt 
under the variable swaps agreements  we receive on the respective notional amounts and pay interest payments on the respective notional amounts at a rate equal to the six month libor plus a spread ranging from to with a weighted average spread of 
the variable swaps expire on august  and have been designated and qualify as fair value hedges and  as a result  changes in the fair value of the variable swaps of million have been recorded against the associated fixed rate long term debt with an offsetting million recorded as a derivative liability within other long term liabilities  and million recorded in other assets
