and per diluted share  respectively 
compared to  the company s total revenues and other income increased by million  or percent  including a million increase in oil and gas revenues 
the increase in oil and gas revenues was due to increases in production volumes and increases of percent  percent and percent in average oil  ngl and gas prices  respectively  including the effects of commodity price hedges 
compared to  the company s total costs and expenses increased by million  or percent  during the year ended december  the increase in total costs and expenses was primarily reflective of a million increase in exploration and abandonments expense  primarily due to increased exploration extension drilling in the gulf of mexico  argentina  canada and south africa  a million increase in depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  primarily driven by increases in depletion associated with increased production volumes from higher cost basis gulf of mexico and south africa properties and an million increase in oil and gas production costs  which primarily resulted from increases in production volumes  the strengthening of both the argentine peso and canadian dollar and commodity prices that impacted variable lease operating expenses and production taxes  partially offset by an million decrease in other expense  primarily due to million of losses recognized during associated with debt extinguished prior to its stated maturity

outlook commodity prices 
world oil prices increased during the year ended december  in response to political unrest and supply disruptions in the middle east as well as other supply and demand factors 
north american gas prices also increased during in response to continued strong supply and demand fundamentals 
the company s outlook for commodity prices is cautiously optimistic 
significant factors that will impact commodity prices include developments in iraq and other middle east countries  the extent to which members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas and variations in key north american gas supply and demand indicators 
pioneer will continue to strategically hedge oil and gas price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on its oil  ngl and gas revenues 
as of december   the company had hedged  barrels per day of oil production under swap contracts with a weighted average fixed price to be received of per bbl 
the company had also hedged  mcf per day of gas production under swap contracts with a weighted average fixed price to be received of per mmbtu 
during january  the company increased its commodity hedge positions by entering into  mcf per day of first quarter gas swap contracts with average per mmbtu fixed prices of 
additionally  at december  the company had net deferred gains on terminated oil hedge contracts of million that will be recognized as increases to oil revenue during and million of net deferred gains on terminated gas hedge contracts that will be recognized as increases to gas revenue during see note j of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company s commodity hedge positions at december  also see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for disclosures about the company s commodity related derivative financial instruments 
capital expenditures 
during  the company s budget for oil and gas capital activities is expected to range from million to million  of which approximately percent has been budgeted for development drilling and facility costs and percent for exploration expenditures 
the company s capital budget is allocated approximately percent to the united states  percent to argentina and the remaining percent is budgeted for expenditures in canada  gabon  tunisia  south africa and other foreign areas 
pioneer expects to drill approximately exploration and development wells during during and  the company expects to expend approximately million and million  respectively  of capital for development drilling and facility costs related to its proved undeveloped reserves 
production growth 
the company expects that its annual worldwide production will range from mmboe to mmboe  or approximately mboe to mboe per day  an increase of percent to percent over levels 
the bottom end of the range includes a full year of production from the company s deepwater gulf of mexico falcon and harrier gas fields  the sable oil field in south africa and the hawa field in tunisia  coupled with increases in production from the company s capital program and the inherent variability in production results 
the company expects  based on quoted futures prices  to generate cash flow significantly in excess of its capital program and has considered the potential to invest a portion of the excess cash for additional development drilling or core area acquisitions in arriving at the top end of the production range 
the outlook for continued production growth in is strong considering that first production from several new projects is not expected until well into the company will have its first full year of production from the devils tower  tomahawk and raptor deepwater fields during  and the company believes it has sufficient development inventory to support production growth in the united states  argentina  canada and tunisia 
as a result  pioneer currently expects production in to match at a minimum  with considerable upside given the potential investment of excess cash flow to develop new exploration successes and or acquire additional assets in core areas during and longer term  with several discoveries to develop for and beyond  a pipeline of exploration opportunities  potential for continued core area acquisitions  continuing strong commodity prices and significant excess cash flow  pioneer has targeted five year average compounded annual production growth of ten percent 
costs and expenses 
the company expects that its costs and expenses that are highly correlated with production volumes  such as production costs and depletion expense  will increase in absolute amounts during additionally  the company expects that depletion expense will increase on a per boe basis during as compared to due to new production from harrier  tomahawk  raptor and devils tower fields in the deepwater gulf of mexico and increased production from the sable oil field offshore south africa 
the per boe cost bases of these fields are higher than that of pioneer s average producing property in additionally  the average per boe lifting costs of devils tower and sable oil field production are expected to exceed the company s average per boe lifting costs 
the company expects average per boe production taxes to decline during as compared to as the production from the aforementioned properties are not burdened by such taxes 
ad valorem taxes are highly correlated with prior year commodity prices 
as a consequence of increases in oil  ngl and gas prices during  ad valorem taxes are expected to be higher in  as compared to the company anticipates an increase in general and administrative expenses during due to additional staffing and the amortization of restricted stock that is being awarded to officers and employees in lieu of stock options  which were awarded in prior years 
capital allocation 
four years ago  the company made a commitment to move its financial position to investment grade standards  and significant improvement has been accomplished during that period with year end debt to book capitalization reaching percent as compared to percent at the end of the company has established a targeted range for debt to book capitalization of percent to percent 
given the expanding financial strength of the company and expectations for significant cash flow in excess of its capital budget  the company expects to use a portion of its excess cash flow in to further reduce long term debt by a minimum of million 
additionally  the company s board of directors have approved a plan to begin a dividend program of 
per common share  payable in two semi annual installments of 
per common share  beginning in during through  the company anticipates  based upon year end futures prices  that it will have significant excess cash flow even after funding its typical annual capital budgets  planned dividends and achieving its leverage targets 
the company considers it a high priority to utilize a portion of the excess cash flow to fund the development of new exploration successes and to selectively acquire additional assets in its core areas 
the company will also consider using a portion of the excess cash flow for share repurchases 
first quarter based on current estimates  the company expects that its first quarter production will average  to  boes per day  reflecting the incremental production from harrier which began producing in january  the variability of oil cargo shipments in tunisia and south africa and the seasonal decline in gas demand during argentina s summer season 
first quarter production costs are expected to average to per boe based on current nymex strip prices for oil and gas 
deprecation  depletion and amortization expense is expected to average to per boe as a greater proportion of the company s production is being produced from higher cost basis deepwater gulf of mexico and south africa properties 
total exploration and abandonment expense is expected to be million to million 
the first quarter range includes a number of high impact deepwater gulf of mexico wells that are in progress  up to five wells expected in gabon to further refine development plans and test a new exploration target  increased exploration drilling in argentina and the winter drilling program in canada 
general and administrative expense is expected to be million to million  million to million of which relates to estimated performance based compensation costs 
interest expense is expected to be million to million and accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is expected to be approximately million 
the company recognizes deferred income taxes reflecting its tax position in each of its areas of operation 
however  cash income taxes are expected to be only million to million  principally related to argentine income taxes and nominal alternative minimum tax in the united states 
other than in argentina  the company continues to benefit from the carryforward of net operating losses and other positive tax attributes 
critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this report in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states gaap 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for a comprehensive discussion of the company s significant accounting policies 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
following is a discussion of the company s most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the company s application of gaap accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
the accounting for and disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires the company s management to choose between gaap alternatives and to make judgments about estimates of future uncertainties 
successful efforts method of accounting 
the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method 
in general  the company believes that  during periods of active exploration  net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method 
the critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method is as follows under the successful efforts method  exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur  whereas  under the full cost method of accounting  such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets  pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense 
during the years ended december   and  the company recognized exploration  abandonment  geological and geophysical expense of million  million and million  respectively  under the successful efforts method 
proved reserve estimates 
estimates of the company s proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of o the quality and quantity of available data  o the interpretation of that data  o the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and o the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the company s proved reserve information included in this report as of december  and was based on evaluations audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the company s major properties and prepared by the company s engineers with respect to all other properties 
the company s proved reserve information included in this report as of december  was based on evaluations prepared by the company s engineers 
estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
it should not be assumed that the present value of future net cash flows included in this report as of december  is the current market value of the company s estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the company based the estimated present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
the company s estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which the company records depletion expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
in addition  a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the company s assessment of its oil and gas producing properties for impairment 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
the company reviews its long lived proved properties to be held and used whenever management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable 
management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon its outlook of future commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties 
proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment by depletable pool  which is the lowest level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated 
impairment of unproved oil and gas properties 
management periodically assesses individually significant unproved oil and gas properties for impairment  on a project by project basis 
management s assessment of the results of exploration activities  commodity price outlooks  planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects impact the amount and timing of impairment provisions 
suspended wells 
the company suspends the costs of exploratory wells that discover hydrocarbons pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the related oil and gas fields 
the ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity and development decisions 
if the company decides not to pursue additional appraisal activities or development of these fields  the costs of these wells will be charged to exploration and abandonment expense 
at december   the company had million of suspended exploratory well costs included in property  plant and equipment 
assessments of functional currencies 
management determines the functional currencies of the company s subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating revenues  costs and expenses 
the us dollar is the functional currency of all of the company s international operations except canada 
the assessment of functional currencies can have a significant impact on periodic results of operations and financial position 
argentine economic and currency measures 
the accounting for and remeasurement of the company s argentine balance sheets as of december  and reflect management s assumptions regarding some uncertainties unique to argentina s current economic situation 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for a description of the assumptions utilized in the preparation of these financial statements 
the argentine economic and political situation continues to evolve and the argentine government may enact future regulations or policies that  when finalized and adopted  may materially impact  among other items  i the realized prices the company receives for the commodities it produces and sells  ii the timing of repatriations of excess cash flow to the company s corporate headquarters in the united states  iii the company s asset valuations  and iv peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
from until  the company maintained a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax asset position in the united states 
sfas requires that the company continually assess both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets can be realized prior to their expiration 
in the third quarter of and as of december   the company concluded that it is more likely than not that it will realize its gross deferred tax asset position in the united states after giving consideration to relevant facts and circumstances 
accordingly  during the third quarter of  the company reversed its remaining valuation allowance in the united states  resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax benefit of million 
for in total  the company reversed million of united states valuation allowances resulting in a net deferred tax benefit for the year 
further  the third quarter reversal of the allowance increased stockholders equity by million as the company recognized the tax effects of previous stock option exercises and deferred hedging gains and losses in other comprehensive income 
see note p of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company s united states deferred tax assets and a specific discussion of the relevant facts and circumstances that were assessed 
pioneer will continue to monitor company specific  oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and will reassess the likelihood that the company s net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in each jurisdiction will be utilized prior to their expiration 
there can be no assurances that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the company to reestablish a united states deferred tax asset valuation allowance in a future period 
as of december   the company does not believe there is sufficient positive evidence to reverse its valuation allowances related to foreign tax jurisdictions 
litigation and environmental contingencies 
the company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation and environmental remediation 
actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons 
the costs to settle litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages 
similarly  environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because of changes in laws  regulations  additional information obtained relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 
under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the company determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimated 
see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company s commitments and contingencies 
results of operations oil and gas revenues 
revenues from oil and gas operations totaled billion during  as compared to million during and million during  representing an percent increase from to the revenue increase from to was due to a percent increase in boe production  a percent increase in oil prices  a percent increase in ngl prices and a percent increase in gas prices  including the effects of commodity price hedges 
the increased production is principally attributable to incremental gas production from the deepwater gulf of mexico canyon express and falcon field projects  initial oil production in south africa and tunisia and increased oil and gas production in argentina  offset by normal production declines 
the revenue decrease from to was principally due to year on year worldwide average oil  ngl and gas price declines of five percent  percent and percent  respectively  including the effects of commodity price hedges  and an eight percent decline in worldwide oil production  partially offset by worldwide ngl and gas production increases of four percent and two percent  respectively

canada worldwide annual percentage increase decrease in average worldwide reported prices oil ngl gas hedging activities 
the oil and gas prices that the company reports are based on the market price received for the commodities adjusted by the results of the company s cash flow hedging activities 
the company utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts in order to i reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the company produces and sells  ii support the company s annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and iii reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects 
the effective portions of changes in the fair values of the company s commodity price hedges are deferred as increases or decreases to stockholders equity until the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
consequently  changes in the effective portions of commodity price hedges add volatility to the company s reported stockholders equity until the hedge derivative matures or is terminated

oil and gas production costs 
the company recorded production costs of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in total production costs during as compared to is primarily attributable to the increase in production volumes  while the decrease in total production costs during as compared to is principally attributable to lower production tax and field fuel expenses due to lower commodity prices 
total production costs per boe increased during the year ended december  by three percent and decreased during the year ended december  by four percent 
in general  lease operating expenses and workover expenses represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the company has management control  while production taxes  ad valorem taxes and field fuel expenses are directly related to commodity price changes 
the increase in production costs per boe during was primarily due to increases in per boe lease operating expenses  field fuel expenses and production taxes  partially offset by decreases in per boe ad valorem taxes and workover expenses 
the increase in per boe lease operating expenses was due to the strengthening of both the argentine peso and the canadian dollar  argentine inflation and higher average lifting costs incurred on south african sable oil field production  while the increases in per boe field fuel expenses and production taxes primarily resulted from increases in north american gas prices and world oil prices 
the decrease in per boe ad valorem taxes is primarily due to the incremental production from the deepwater gulf of mexico  argentina  south africa and tunisia fields which are not subject to ad valorem taxes 
the decrease in production costs during was primarily due to decreases in field fuel expense and production taxes as a result of lower north american average gas prices and lower argentine lease operating expenses resulting from lower argentine expenses on a us dollar equivalent basis due to the devaluation of the argentine peso versus the us dollar  partially offset by moderately higher workover expenses  ad valorem taxes which are computed using prior year average annual commodity prices and declines in the third party gas processing and treating margin component of lease operating expense

 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  and standard industry practice 
almost all costs included in the unproved properties caption on the balance sheet are leasehold mineral interests that are regularly evaluated for impairment based on lease term and drilling activity
