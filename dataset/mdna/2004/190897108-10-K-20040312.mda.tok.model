item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the company is a financial holding company that offers a broad array of financial service products to its target market of small and medium sized businesses and high net worth individuals 
our operating segments include our commercial banking franchise  colorado business bank and arizona business bank  investment banking services  trust and advisory services  and insurance services 
earnings are derived primarily from our net interest income  which is interest income less interest expense  and our noninterest income earned from our fee based business lines and banking service fees  offset by noninterest expense 
as the majority of our assets are interest earning and our liabilities are interest bearing  changes in interest rates impact our net interest margin  the largest component of our operating revenue 
we manage our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our operating results 
we also have focused on reducing our dependency on our net interest margin by increasing our noninterest income 
our fee based business lines have continued to grow  with the additions of acmg and fdl during  which added investment management  high end life insurance products  and wealth transfer planning to the array of financial services offered to our targeted customer base 
our ratio of noninterest income to total operating revenues increased to for compared to in as a result of this continued focus 
in  the bank recognized continued growth in what was considered an economic slowdown 
significant strides were made in the arizona market  which we first entered in  through the recruitment of several senior level bankers who brought a significant amount of real estate experience with them 
the colorado market has also seen signs of improvement  both in reported economic data and increased customer activity 
at a time when interest rates were at near record lows and financial institutions were experiencing severe compression on their net interest margins  we managed our interest earning assets and liabilities to maintain a net interest margin that has only decreased basis points from the prior year 
our management has focused on developing an organization with personnel  management systems  and products that will allow us to compete effectively and position us for growth 
the cost of this process relative to our size has been high 
in addition  we have operated with excess capacity during the start up phases of various projects 
as a result  relatively high levels of non interest expense have adversely affected our earnings over the past several years 
salaries and employee benefits comprised most of this overhead category 
however  we believe that our compensation levels have allowed us to recruit and retain a highly qualified management team capable of implementing our business strategies 
we believe our compensation policies  which include the granting of options to purchase common stock to many employees  have highly motivated our employees and enhanced our ability to maintain customer loyalty and generate earnings 
for additional discussion on options granted to employees  see note and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
while we will continue to add personnel to lead new growth initiatives  including middle management  we believe our senior management and systems infrastructure are adequate to support our anticipated growth without incurring proportionate increases in general  administrative  and other non interest expenses 
from december   the first complete fiscal year under the current management team  to december   our shareholders equity increased  from million to million 
during that same time period  our outstanding loans and leases net increased  from million to million 
this increase has primarily been the result of our focus on local relationship banking and commercial lending to small and medium sized businesses and high net worth individuals 
in addition  we have emphasized building and maintaining asset quality through our credit underwriting and monitoring process 
nonperforming assets have ranged from to of total assets during this period 
we have maintained asset quality  while continuing to build our allowance for loan and lease losses 
our allowance for loan and lease losses increased  from million at december  to million at december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k beginning on page f for a discussion of the segments included in our principal activities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
in making those critical accounting estimates  we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the assumptions that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibilty of loans and leases in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan and lease portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
we maintain a loan review program independent of the lending function that is designed to reduce and control risk in the lending function 
it includes the monitoring of lending activities with respect to underwriting and processing new loans  preventing insider abuse and timely follow up and corrective action for loans showing signs of deterioration in quality 
we also have a systematic process to evaluate individual loans and pools of loans within our loan and lease portfolio 
we maintain a loan grading system whereby each loan is assigned a grade between and  with representing the highest quality credit  representing a non accrual loan  and representing a loss that will be charged off 
grades are assigned based upon the degree of risk associated with repayment of a loan in the normal course of business pursuant to the original terms 
loans above a certain dollar amount that are adversely graded are reported to the loan committee and the chief credit officer along with current financial information  a collateral analysis and an action plan 
individual loans that are deemed to be impaired are evaluated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses  we model an analysis of the various components of the loan and lease portfolio  including all significant credits on an individual basis 
when analyzing the adequacy we segment the loan and lease portfolio into components with similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
possible factors that may impact the allowance for loan and lease losses include  but are not limited to changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices 
changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  including the condition of various market segments 
changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio 
changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff 
changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans  and trends in the volume of non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings  and other loan modifications 
changes in the quality of the loan review system and the degree of oversight by the board of directors 
the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations 
the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
refer to the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses section under results of operations below for further discussion on management s methodology 
recoverability of goodwill sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that we evaluate on an annual basis or whenever events occur which may indicate possible impairment whether any portion of our recorded goodwill is impaired 
the recoverability of goodwill is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  goodwill is considered impaired 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using market multiples of comparable entities  including recent transactions  or a combination of market multiples and a discounted cash flow methodology 
we conducted our annual evaluation of our reporting units  including our investment banking subsidiary  gmb  as of december  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  for the period ending december  the estimated fair value of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values and goodwill impairment was not deemed to exist 
since the acquisition of gmb  merger and acquisition activity has decreased as a result of poor economic conditions 
as such  the revenues of gmb have been less than their projected targets 
although we fully expect merger and acquisition activity to increase as the economy improves  if gmb continues to recognize operational losses our evaluation of the fair value of gmb could result in the determination that the carrying value of the business exceeds its fair value and that goodwill relating to gmb has been impaired 
if we were to conclude that goodwill has been impaired  that conclusion could result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  however  these policies  which are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
financial condition the acquisition of milek insurance services  inc and first capital bank of arizona were accounted for as poolings of interests 
accordingly  the company s financial statements for all years presented in this report give retroactive effect to those acquisitions and combine the assets  liabilities  shareholders equity  income and expenses of the company and the acquired entities at all dates and for all periods covered by the financial statements 
all of the comparative information contained in the following sections of this report also gives retroactive effect to those acquisitions as though the company and the acquired entities had been combined at both dates or for both periods being compared 
the acquisitions of acmg  fdl and gmb were accounted for as purchases and the assets  liabilities  income and expenses of the acquired entities are included in the company s financial statements only for periods following the closing of the acquisitions 
for a summary of the contributions of the operations formerly conducted by our acquisitions to the assets and income of the company during each period reported  see the segment information in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
december   compared to december  our total assets increased by million to billion at december   from billion at december  our continued penetration into the arizona market and the addition of new senior level bankers in both colorado and arizona have allowed our loan and lease portfolio net to increase by million  from million at december   to million at december  during  the colorado franchise grew gross loans and leases by  while the arizona franchise grew by 
although the economy had not fully recovered in the colorado market  we were able to grow by taking market share from some of the larger banks 
the overall growth in the loan portfolio during the year was comprised primarily of million in real estate mortgage loans and million in commercial loans 
as of december   real estate mortgage loans were the largest single component of the net loan portfolio at compared to at december  commercial loans were of the net loan portfolio at december  compared to at december  the allowance for loan and lease losses totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  compared to december  total investments were million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in the investment portfolio was possible due to strong deposit growth resulting from the matters described below  as well as securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
mortgage backed securities totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the company increased the investment portfolio with adjustable rate mortgage backed securities during as a method to manage liquidity and interest rate risk  and to provide interest income 
mortgage backed securities are generally considered to have low credit risk due to being issued by government sponsored organizations 
goodwill was million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase in goodwill was due to million from the acquisition of fdl  million from the acquisition of acmg and million from the conversion of the class b shares issued in the gmb acquisition to our common stock 
intangible assets have also increased by million during due to the aforementioned acquisitions 
as part of the purchase price allocations  the company has recognized intangible assets related to customer lists and contracts at december   totaling million from fdl and million from acmg 
other assets increased by million to million at december  from million at december  the increase is primarily related to the purchase of million of bank owned life insurance boli policies on certain key officers 
these policies are reported in other assets 
earnings from these policies  by way of increases in their cash surrender value  is intended to offset future costs of employee benefits 
deposits increased by million to million at december   from million at december  noninterest bearing deposits increased by million  and interest bearing deposits increased by million 
noninterest bearing demand deposits comprised of total deposits at december  proceeds from deposit origination were primarily used for loan originations and the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by million at december   to million 
securities sold under agreement to repurchase are represented by two types  customer repurchase agreements and street repurchase agreements 
management does not consider customer repurchase agreements to be a wholesale funding source  but rather an additional treasury management service provided to our customer base 
of the million total  million represents repurchase agreements transacted on behalf of our customers 
the increase in deposits and customer repurchase agreements is attributable  in part  to our continued emphasis on deposit generation as well as a market preference for the low risk of fdic insured funds compared to the volatile equities market 
advances from the fhlb were million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in advances from the fhlb were primarily used for loan originations and the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
accrued interest and other liabilities increased by million to million at december  from million at december  the increase is primarily attributable to an million liability owed to the former shareholders of fdl in accordance with the earn out payment stipulated in the merger agreement 
this liability was paid in the first quarter of in equal amounts of stock and cash 
junior subordinated debentures increased by million primarily due to a pooled trust preferred offering that was issued on september  through a statutory trust established by the company 
in conjunction with the issuance of the trust preferred offering  the company issued million in junior subordinated debentures to the trust 
although the provisions of fin no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities precludes the consolidation of the statutory trust  the junior subordinated debentures are included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
december   compared to december  our total assets increased by million to billion at december   from million at december  a consistent focus on internal growth and sustained loan demand allowed our loan and lease portfolio net to increase by million  from million at december   to million at december  total investments were million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in the investment portfolio was possible due to strong deposit growth  as well as securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
deposits increased by million to million at december   from million at december  noninterest bearing deposits increased by million  and interest bearing deposits increased by million 
noninterest bearing demand deposits comprised of total deposits at december  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by million at december   to million 
of this total  million represents repurchase agreements transacted on behalf of our customers and is not considered a wholesale borrowing source 
the increase in deposits and customer repurchase agreements is attributable  in part  to the bear market as investors pulled out of equities and into safer harbors such as certificates of deposit  money market accounts and real estate 
an increased emphasis on deposit generation included in banker production goals has also impacted our deposit growth 
advances from the fhlb were million at december   compared to million at december  net interest income the largest component of our net income is our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans  leases and investment securities  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain information related to our average asset and liability structure and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities 
for the year ended december  average balance interest earned or paid average yield or cost average balance interest earned or paid average yield or cost average balance interest earned or paid average yield or cost in thousands assets federal funds sold and other investment securities loans and leases allowance for loan and lease losses total interest earning assets noninterest earning assets cash and due from banks other total assets liabilities and shareholders equity deposits now and money market accounts savings certificates of deposit under   and over total interest bearing deposits other borrowings securities and loans sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased fhlb advances company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing demand accounts total deposits and interest bearing liabilities other noninterest bearing liabilities total liabilities and preferred securities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net interest income net interest spread net interest margin ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities yields do not include adjustments for tax exempt interest because the amount of such interest is not material 
loan fees included in interest income are not material 
nonaccrual loans and leases are included in average loans and leases outstanding 
the following table illustrates  for the periods indicated  the changes in the levels of interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in volume or rate 
changes in net interest income due to both volume and rate have been included in the changes due to rate

loan fees included in interest income are not material 
nonaccrual loans and leases are included in average loans and leases outstanding 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management asset liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of repricing assets compared to liabilities 
it is our objective to generate stable growth in net interest income and to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  our strategy is to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income by maintaining a favorable match between the maturities or repricing dates of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we adjust interest sensitivity during the year through changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset liability management committee  in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors of the bank 
this committee meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the asset liability committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee reviews our liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  deposit activity  current market conditions  and general levels of interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  we use simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various interest rate scenarios 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the following table presents an analysis of the interest rate sensitivity inherent in our net interest income and market value of equity 
the interest rate scenario presented in the table includes interest rates at december  as adjusted by instantaneous rate changes upward and downward of up to basis points 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  this analysis is not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates 
the market value sensitivity analysis presented includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at december  will remain constant over the month measurement period  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  the analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on us 
change in interest rates in basis points impact on net interest income market value of equity our results of operations depend significantly on net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the marketplace 
rising and falling interest rate environments can have various impacts on net interest income  depending on the interest rate profile ie  the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relative changes in interest rates that occur when various assets and liabilities reprice  unscheduled repayments of loans and leases and investments  early withdrawals of deposits and other factors 
as a general rule  banks with positive interest rate gaps are more likely to be susceptible to declines in net interest income in periods of falling interest rates  while banks with negative interest rate gaps are more likely to experience declines in net interest income in periods of rising interest rates 
at december   our cumulative interest rate gap for the period of less than one year was a positive 
therefore  assuming no change in our gap position  a rise in interest rates is likely to result in increased net interest income  while a decline in interest rates is likely to result in decreased net interest income 
this is a point in time position that is continually changing and is not indicative of our position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
consequently  in addition to gap analysis  we use the simulation model discussed above to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap  of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  all amounts in the table are based on contractual repricing schedules 
actual prepayment and withdrawal experience may vary significantly from the assumptions reflected in the table 
estimated maturity or repricing at december  less than three months three months to less than one year one to five years over five years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets fixed rate loans floating rate loans lease financing investment securities held to maturity and available for sale total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities now and money market accounts savings time deposits under  time deposits  and over securities and loans sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased federal home loan bank advances junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities interest rate gap cumulative interest rate gap cumulative interest rate gap to total assets to manage these relationships  we evaluate the following factors liquidity  equity  debt capital ratio  anticipated prepayment rates  portfolio maturities  maturing assets and maturing liabilities 
our asset and liability management committee is responsible for establishing procedures that enable us to achieve our goals while adhering to prudent banking practices and existing loan and investment policies 
we have focused on maintaining balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and repricing frequencies 
an important element of this focus has been to emphasize variable rate loans and investments funded by deposits that also mature or reprice over periods of twelve months or less 
the following table presents  at december   loans and leases by maturity in each major category of our portfolio 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications 
at december  less than one year one to five years over five years total dollars in thousands commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer direct financing leases net total loans and leases at december   of the million of loans and leases with maturities of one year or more  approximately million were fixed rate loans and leases and million were variable rate loans and leases 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  general 
the inclusion of the accounts of fdl and acmg  which were acquired in april  and were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting contributed to the increases in non interest income and non interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company s financial statements prior to the acquisition dates have not been restated to reflect the assets or earnings of fdl and acmg 
earnings performance 
net earnings available to common shareholders were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of million after provision for loan and lease losses  and an increase in non interest income of million  offset by a million increase in non interest expense 
reported earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for were  versus for the same period a year ago 
return on average assets was for  compared to in return on average common shareholders equity was for the year ended december   versus for the year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan and lease losses was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared with the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in interest earning assets due to the increase in investments and loans  partially offset by a decrease in the average yield in compared to the bank has historically maintained an asset sensitive interest rate profile  and was negatively impacted by the decreasing rate environment of the past few years as rates on interest earning assets decreased more quickly than rates on interest bearing liabilities 
the most recent impacts to our interest rate profile was the basis point decrease in the prime rate during the fourth quarter of and the basis point decrease that occurred towards the end of the second quarter of mitigating the decreases in the prime rate was an interest rate swap the company entered into in january of the swap effectively converted our junior subordinated debentures into a variable rate liability based on a spread over three month libor  for a combined rate of for the quarter ending december  and for the year then ended 
yields on our interest earning assets declined by basis points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  yields paid on interest bearing liabilities dropped by basis points during this same period 
the overall result was a net interest margin of for the year ended december   down slightly from for the year ended december  provision and allowance for loan and lease losses 
the provision for loan and lease losses increased by  to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to the increase in total loans and leases outstanding and is not reflective of a deterioration of credit quality 
key indicators of asset quality have remained favorable as net charge offs and non performing loans and leases have actually decreased in compared to  while average outstanding loan amounts have increased to million for  up from million for at december   the allowance for loan and lease losses amounted to million  or of total loans and leases compared to of total loans at december  noninterest income 
the following table presents noninterest income for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease amount noninterest income deposit service charges operating lease income other loan fees trust and advisory income insurance revenue investment banking revenue other income gain loss on sale of other assets total noninterest income the increase in insurance revenue was driven by the acquisition of fdl  which generated million in revenue during a significant portion of fdl s revenue is considered transactional revenue  generated by the sale of life insurance policies where a significant amount is earned when the policy is signed 
during  million was earned from this revenue stream 
the revenue earned from the sale of insurance policies in is not necessarily indicative of future results 
the increase in trust and advisory income was primarily attributable to the acquisition of acmg  which generated million in investment advisory fees for the period subsequent to the acquisition date 
acmg s revenues are dependent upon the market value of their assets under management 
as the equity markets have shown improvement during the latter part of  acmg s income has increased each quarter since the acquisition in april as of december   the company had million in assets under management  up from million in due to the acquisition of acmg 
the increases in noninterest income from insurance revenue and trust and advisory fees were offset by a million net decrease in other fee based areas 
investment banking revenues were down million in compared to while the pipeline of engagements for gmb has been steady  only two engagements were successfully closed during however  the number of clients under engagement has increased at december   compared to december  although there is still some economic uncertainty  there are a number of opportunities for gmb in the growing gap between the lack of quality deals in the marketplace and the pent up private equity demand may lead to higher sale multiples for quality companies and increased m a transaction volume in and operating lease income has decreased  in to  compared to  in this is a result of concentrating our marketing efforts in on originating loans  rather than leases 
we focused on generating loans  as opposed to leases  because the interest spreads on loans have been more favorable 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in service charges related to the growth in our customer and deposit base and the impact of our treasury management sales efforts 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for includes the operations or acmg and fdl for the nine months of subsequent to the acquisition dates 
the following table presents noninterest expense for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease amount noninterest expenses salaries and employee benefits occupancy expenses  premises and equipment depreciation on leases amortization of intangibles other operating expenses total other expense during our efficiency ratio increased to from for the comparable period in in general  the increase in noninterest expense was due to the acquisitions as previously noted  and overall growth during the year 
salary and benefits have increased due to higher staffing levels to accommodate the growth of the franchise  annual merit increases  and increases in health insurance and other benefit costs 
occupancy costs have increased due to the aforementioned acquisitions  the additions of the tempe and northeast bank branches during  and the inclusion of the scottsdale branch for its first full year 
an ongoing commitment to providing the highest level of technological service to our customers has also increased our depreciation and maintenance expense 
other operating expenses have increased primarily in the areas of marketing  correspondent bank and federal reserve charges  fdic and occ assessments  professional services and fees paid to our board of directors 
the increase in marketing is a direct result of our growth initiatives as we attempt to increase our loan and deposit bases 
our correspondent bank and federal reserve charges continue to increase as we grow and service high volume customers  which increases our correspondent and federal reserve activity 
professional services have increased as we implement and explore new it initiatives  as well as an increase in external accountant fees  which is partly due to the implementations of the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of during  we also amended our fee structure for the amounts paid to our board of directors to align the fees with the industry 
federal income taxes 
the provision for income taxes totaled million during  compared to million during the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  earnings performance 
net earnings available to common shareholders were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of million 
reported earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for were  versus for the same period a year ago 
return on average assets was for both and return on average common shareholders equity was for the year ended december   versus for the year ended december  total assets increased to billion at december   a increase from million at december  strong loan production was responsible for much of this growth 
net loans and leases grew million from to net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan and lease losses was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared with the year ended december  the bank has historically maintained an asset sensitive interest rate profile and was negatively impacted by the decreasing rate environment of as rates on interest earning assets decreased more quickly than rates on interest bearing liabilities 
the stable rate environment of allowed our cost of funds to decline in excess of the decrease in yields on our interest earning assets 
yields on our interest earning assets declined by basis points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  yields paid on interest bearing liabilities dropped by basis points during this same period 
the overall result was a net interest margin of for the year ended december   up slightly from for the year ended december  the increase in average earning assets due to growth of to million for  from million for also helped maintain the net interest margin 
provision and allowance for loan and lease losses 
the provision for loan and lease losses increased by  to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to the increase in total loans and leases outstanding and is not reflective of a deterioration of credit quality 
key indicators of asset quality have remained favorable minimal changes in nonperforming asset trends  while average outstanding loan amounts have increased to million for  up from million for at december   the allowance for loan and lease losses amounted to million  or of total loans and leases compared to at december noninterest income 
the following table presents noninterest income for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease amount noninterest income deposit service charges operating lease income other loan fees trust income insurance revenue investment banking revenue other income gain on sale of other assets total noninterest income total noninterest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in investment banking revenues to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ago period primarily due to closing one significant transaction in the second quarter of in addition  we reported an increase in deposit service charges and other banking service related fees as a result of growth in our core customer base due to banker incentive goals 
trust fees from our private asset management division are up year over year due to an increase in the assets under management 
however  the overall decline in the stock market has adversely impacted the division s revenues  as their fees are based on the market valuation of the accounts they manage 
insurance commissions from fdl formerly cobiz connect and cobiz insurance have shown steady growth as they continue to expand their client base and synergies are realized between this segment and the core banking franchise 
there was a net decrease in operating lease rentals of  which was the result of concentrating our marketing efforts in on originating loans  rather than leases 
we focused on generating loans  as opposed to leases  because the interest spreads on loans have been more favorable 
net investment in operating leases was  at december   compared to million at december  overall  investment banking revenues contributed to an increase in the amount of noninterest income we reported in however  merger and acquisition activity in was characterized by low deal volume  below average purchase price multiples and reduced capital markets activity 
this combination of factors resulted in lower than expected results for our investment banking subsidiary  gmb 
noninterest expense 
the following table presents noninterest expense for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease amount noninterest expenses salaries and employee benefits occupancy expenses  premises and equipment depreciation on leases amortization of intangibles other operating expenses nonrecurring expenses total other expense total noninterest expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  noninterest expense for includes gmb overhead for the full year  while noninterest expense for only includes gmb from the transaction date july 
during our efficiency ratio increased to from for the comparable period in overall  the increases in noninterest expenses reflected our ongoing investment in personnel  technology  and office space needed to accommodate internal growth 
offsetting the increases in salaries and occupancy costs was a decrease of  in depreciation expense on operating leases

the provision for income taxes totaled million during  compared to million during the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity management objective is to ensure our ability to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to allow us to sustain our operations 
historically  our primary source of funds has been customer deposits 
scheduled loan and lease repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan and lease prepayments which are influenced by fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  returns available on other investments  competition  economic conditions  and other factors are relatively unstable 
in addition  the company has commitments to extend credit under lines of credit and stand by letters of credit 
the company has also committed to investing in certain partnerships 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on these commitments 
borrowings may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity or repricing intervals of assets 
the company is required under federal banking regulations to maintain sufficient reserves to fund deposit withdrawals  loan commitments  and expenses 
we monitor our cash position on a daily basis in order to meet these requirements 
we use various forms of short term borrowings for cash management and liquidity purposes on a limited basis 
these forms of borrowings include federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  the state of colorado treasury s time deposit program and borrowings from the fhlb 
the bank has approved federal funds purchase lines with six other banks with an aggregate credit line of million as well as credit lines of million with three firms to transact repurchase agreements 
in addition  the bank may apply for up to million of state of colorado time deposits 
the bank also has a line of credit from the fhlb that is limited by the amount of eligible collateral available to secure it 
borrowings under the fhlb line are required to be secured by unpledged securities and qualifying loans 
at december   we had million in unpledged securities and qualifying loans available to collateralize fhlb borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
at the holding company level  our primary source of funds are dividends paid from the bank  management fees assessed to the bank and the fee based business lines  proceeds from the issuance of common stock and other capital markets activity 
the main use of this liquidity is the quarterly payment of dividends on our common stock  quarterly interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures  payments for mergers and acquisitions activity including potential earn out payments  and payments for the salaries and benefits for the employees of the holding company 
the approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency is required prior to the declaration of any dividend by the bank if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of provides that the bank cannot pay a dividend if it will cause the bank to be undercapitalized 
the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends upon the availability of dividends from the bank and earnings from its fee based businesses  and upon the company s compliance with the capital adequacy guidelines of the frb 
see item business supervision and regulation and note of notes to consolidated financial statements of cobiz for an analysis of the compliance of the bank and cobiz with applicable capital adequacy guidelines

the interest rate swap is carried at its fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
because the interest rate swap recorded on the balance sheet at december  does not represent amounts that will ultimately be received or paid under the contract  it is excluded from the table above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the earnings of the bank and earnings from the acquisition of fdl  offset by funding provided to gmb for its operational cash uses

net cash provided by financing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributed to an increase in net advances from the federal home loan bank million  an increase in cash flows from securities sold under agreement to repurchase million  and the issuance of junior subordinated debentures million  offset by reduced cash inflows from total deposits and federal funds purchased million during the year ended as compared to although the company grew its deposit base during  it did not increase at the same level as in  primarily due to the soft economy in colorado 
as a result  the company increased its level of wholesale borrowing fhlb advances and street repurchase agreements during the issuance of the junior subordinated debentures in september  was part of a strategy to obtain funds with a low cost of capital to finance our acquisitions and to provide capital to the bank 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the earnings of the bank  offset by funding provided to its subsidiaries fdl formerly cobiz connect and gmb for their operational cash uses

the decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to a reduction in cash used to fund loan and lease originations and repayments million  offset by a decrease in cash provided by maturing investments million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributed to customer deposit accounts million and securities sold under agreement to repurchase million  offset by increased net fhlb repayments million 
effects of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most retail or manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution such as the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  the impact of interest rates on a financial institution s performance is generally greater than the impact of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or to the same extent  as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as inflation
