overview cv therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of new small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases 
since our inception in december  substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to research and development 
to date  we have not generated any product revenues and do not expect to generate any product revenues until we receive marketing approval and launch one of our products  if at all 
until that time  we expect our sources of revenues  if any  to consist of payments under corporate partnerships and interest income until one of our products receives marketing approval  if at all 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the process of developing and commercializing our products requires significant research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  manufacturing arrangements as well as marketing approvals 
these activities  together with our sales and marketing expenses and our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we will not receive product revenues unless and until we or our collaborative partners complete clinical trials  obtain marketing approval  and successfully commercialize one or more of our products 
we are developing our lead drug candidate ranexa for the potential treatment of chronic angina 
unlike current anti anginal drug therapies  ranexa appears to exert its anti anginal activity without depending on reductions in heart rate or blood pressure 
in december  we submitted an nda for ranexa to the fda 
on october   the fda sent us an approvable letter indicating that ranexa is approvable  that there is evidence that ranexa is an effective anti anginal  and that additional clinical information is needed prior to approval 
on december   the cardiovascular and renal drugs advisory committee of the fda discussed a range of issues relating to the review of ranexa  but did not vote on any matters presented to it 
based on verbal discussions with the fda since that time  we anticipate that we can receive from the fda initial marketing approval of ranexa with the successful completion of a single study 
we are still in discussions with the fda about the exact details of this study  which will be in a restricted population of angina patients  and which we believe can be conducted following an agreement with the fda under an spa 
we believe that the number of patients to be enrolled in the trial will be between the number of patients enrolled in our two prior phase iii studies of ranexa  and that enrollment could be completed in  which could allow for a potential launch of ranexa in in the united states 
if approved by the fda  ranexa would represent the first new class of anti anginal therapy in the united states in more than years 
we are also developing regadenoson  an a 
a 
adenosine receptor agonist  for potential use as a pharmacologic agent in cardiac perfusion imaging studies 
tecadenoson  an a adenosine receptor agonist  is being developed for the potential reduction of rapid heart rate during atrial arrhythmias 
adentri  an a adenosine receptor antagonist for the potential treatment of acute and chronic chf  is licensed to biogen  inc now biogen 
table of contents idec inc 
in addition  we have several research and preclinical development programs designed to bring additional drug candidates into human clinical testing 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition  use of hazardous materials and retention of key employees 
in order for a product to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us and  in some cases  our collaborators  to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies presently involve our more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements valuation of marketable securities we invest our excess cash balances primarily in short term and long term marketable debt securities for use in current operations 
accordingly  we have classified all investments as short term  even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
estimated fair value is based upon quoted market prices for these or similar instruments 
revenue recognition revenue under our collaborative research arrangements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract 
amounts received under such arrangements consist of up front license and periodic milestone payments 
up front or milestone payments which are still subject to future performance requirements are recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized over the performance period 
the performance period is estimated at the inception of the arrangement and is periodically reevaluated 
the reevaluation of the performance period may shorten or lengthen the period during which the deferred revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the appropriate period based on research progress attained and events such as changes in the regulatory and competitive environment 
payments received related to substantive  at risk milestones are recognized upon achievement of the scientific or regulatory event specified in the underlying agreement 
payments received for research activities are recognized as the related research effort is performed 
research and development expenses and accruals research and development expenses include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for clinical trials  manufacturing and process development  research and other consulting activities  costs are expensed upon the earlier of when non refundable amounts are due or as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 

table of contents our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful accrual of patients  the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
results of operations years ended december  and collaborative research revenues 
collaborative research revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million milestone payment from fujisawa recognized in october  earned in conjunction with the initiation of a pivotal phase iii trial of regadenoson  and increased reimbursable development costs related to our collaboration with fujisawa for the development of regadenoson 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to reduced outside contract service expenses of approximately million primarily for our three clinical development programs ranexa  regadenoson and tecadenoson 
the decrease was partially offset by increased headcount and associated expenses of million and an upfront payment we made to a collaboration partner of million 
over short term periods we expect continued variability including increases and decreases in our research and development expenditures  based on the timing of the initiation and conclusion of clinical trials 
in general  we expect research and development expenses may increase in the future as we further expand product development efforts 
management categorizes research and development expenditures into preclinical research expenses as opposed to clinical development program expenses  and also by personnel and facility related expenses as opposed to outside contract service expenses as follows year ended december  in thousands preclinical research clinical development total research and development personnel and facility related contract services total research and development our three clinical development programs listed in rank order of expenditures for the year ended december  are as follows ranexa  regadenoson and tecadenoson 
the decreased allocation of resources to clinical development projects compared to preclinical research  and the decreased allocation of resources to contracted services compared to personnel and facility related expenses  in the year ended december  compared to 
table of contents the year ended december   primarily reflect decreased late stage contracted clinical development costs for ranexa 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses of million in preparation for potential ranexa approval  and a non cash expense of approximately million associated with the warrant issued to quintiles to purchase  shares of our common stock in conjunction with modifying our commercialization agreement with quintiles in the warrant was valued using the black scholes model  the assumptions used were a term of five years  a risk free interest rate of and volatility of 
we do not expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase until we launch our first product 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to fees paid in connection with outside consulting services and additional personnel and facility expenses to support our increased research  development and pre commercialization efforts 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future in line with our research  development and pre commercialization activities 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates on our investments 
we expect that interest income will fluctuate in the future with average investment balances and interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to amortization of debt issuance costs and interest associated with the june issuance of our senior subordinated convertible debentures 
our subordinated convertible notes accounted for million of the interest expense in each of these years 
our senior subordinated convertible debentures accounted for million of the interest expense in the year ended december  we expect that interest and other expense will fluctuate in the future with average loan balances 
taxes 
we have not generated taxable income to date 
as of december   the net operating losses potentially available to offset future taxable income for federal and california income tax purposes were approximately million and million  respectively 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards will likely be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the federal carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the california carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the federal research tax credits will expire at various dates beginning in the year  if not utilized 
as a result of annual limitations  a portion of these carryforwards and research tax credits will likely expire before becoming available to reduce our federal and california income tax liabilities 
years ended december  and collaborative research revenues 
collaborative research revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a million milestone payment recognized in march from biogen  inc  earned in conjunction with their initiation of a phase i oral development program for adentri  and a million milestone payment recognized in september from fujisawa related to our initiation of a phase ii clinical trial for regadenoson  partially offset by increased reimbursement during of certain development costs related to our collaboration with fujisawa 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the 
table of contents increase was primarily due to expenses for the ranexa program related to nda preparation and submission  and manufacturing related agreements along with hiring additional employees to support our research and development programs and expenses associated with our tecadenoson and regadenoson programs 
research and development expenditures are categorized by management into preclinical research expenses as opposed to clinical development program expenses and also by personnel and facility related expenses as opposed to outside contracted service expenses are as follows year ended december  in thousands preclinical research clinical development total research and development personnel and facility related contract services total research and development our three clinical development programs listed in rank order of expenditures for the periods above are as follows ranexa  tecadenoson and regadenoson 
the increased allocation of resources to development projects compared to preclinical research and the increased allocation of resources to contracted services compared to personnel and facility related expenses in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily reflect the increased costs of advancing our clinical programs into late stage clinical development and nda preparation and submission related expenses for ranexa 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to pre commercialization activities for the ranexa program  including expenses for marketing planning and market communications 
we have not incurred any sales related expenses 
sales and marketing expenses have previously been included in research and development expenses and all prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to fees paid in connection with outside consulting services and additional personnel and facility expenses to support our increased research  development and pre commercialization efforts 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates 
the average investment balances were lower primarily as the result of cash used to fund operations 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   which was consistent with interest expense of million for the year ended december  our subordinated convertible notes account for million of the interest expense in each of these years 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to 
table of contents account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
applied to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  our adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb revised fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
it explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interest in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
this interpretation  as revised  applies to reporting periods ending after march  the company does not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private placements and public offerings of debt and equity securities  equipment and leasehold improvement financing  other debt financing and payments under corporate collaborations 
for at least the next months  we expect to be able to fund our operations from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which totaled million as of december  as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  as compared to million at december  net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   and resulted primarily from operating losses adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in other assets  accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities  and deferred revenue 
net cash used by investing activities of million in the year ended december  consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities and of marketable securities of million  capital expenditures and other investing activities of million 
marketable securities increased by million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities of million in the year ended december  was primarily due to net proceeds of million from the issuance of million of senior subordinated convertible debentures in june and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock  including million pursuant to our financing arrangements with acqua wellington 
since december   we have sold an additional approximately million of our common stock  including approximately million to mainfield enterprises  inc and million pursuant to our financing arrangement with acqua wellington 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase for each year was primarily due to increased research  development and commercialization efforts 
as of december   we have invested million in property and equipment with the rate of investment having increased in line with increased research and development efforts and as we expand our facilities 
we expect to continue to make investments in property and equipment to support our growth

equity lines of credit in august  we entered into a financing arrangement with acqua wellington to purchase our common stock 
as of april   we and acqua wellington mutually agreed to terminate the financing arrangement in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement 
under the purchase agreement  as amended  we had the ability to sell up to million of our common stock to acqua wellington through december applicable nasdaq national market rules limited the number of shares of common stock that we could issue under our purchase agreement with acqua wellington to approximately  shares 
since we effectively reached the nasdaq limit  as of april   the purchase agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms 
through april   we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock in exchange for aggregate net cash proceeds of million under this arrangement 
in july  we entered into a new financing arrangement with acqua wellington to purchase our common stock 
under the new purchase agreement  we have the ability to sell up to million of our common stock  or  shares of our common stock  whichever occurs first  to acqua wellington through november the purchase agreement provides that from time to time  in our sole discretion  we may present acqua wellington with draw down notices constituting offers to sell our common stock for specified total proceeds over a specified trading period 
once presented with a draw down notice  acqua wellington is required to purchase a pro rata portion of shares of our common stock as allocated on each trading day during the trading period on which the daily volume weighted average price for our common stock exceeds a threshold price that we have determined and stated in the draw down notice 
the per share price then equals the daily volume weighted average price on each date during the pricing period  less a to discount based on our market capitalization 
however  if the daily volume weighted average price falls below the threshold price on any day in the pricing period  acqua wellington is not required to purchase the pro rata portion of shares allocated to that day  but may elect to buy that pro rata portion of shares at the threshold price less the applicable to discount 
upon each sale of our common stock to acqua wellington under the purchase agreement  we have also 
table of contents agreed to pay alder creek capital  llc  member nasd sipc  a placement fee equal to one fifth of one percent of the aggregate dollar amount of common stock purchased by acqua wellington

the purchase agreement also provides that from time to time  in our sole discretion  we may grant acqua wellington a right to exercise one or more call options to purchase additional shares of our common stock during a drawn down pricing period  in an amount and for a threshold price that we determine and state in the draw down notice 
however  the total call amount for any given draw down cannot exceed a specified maximum amount  and the amount of proceeds we may receive by exercise of a call option for any given trading day is also limited

risks and uncertainties related to our product development efforts and future capital requirements according to industry statistics  it generally takes to years to research  develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the united states 
drug development in the us is a process that includes multiple steps defined by the fda under applicable statutes  regulations and guidance documents 
after the pre clinical research process of identifying  selecting and testing in animals a potential pharmaceutical compound  the clinical development process begins with the filing of an ind 
if successful  an ind allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase i  ii and iii 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are usually for phase iii trials  which tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after the completion of a successful preclinical and clinical development program  an nda must be filed with the fda  which includes among other things very large amounts of preclinical and clinical data and results and manufacturing related information necessary to support requested approval of the product 
the nda must be reviewed by the fda  and the review and approval process is often uncertain  time consuming and costly 
in light of the steps and complexities involved  the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
actual product timelines and costs are subject to enormous variability and are very difficult to predict  as our clinical development programs are updated and changed to reflect the most recent clinical and pre clinical data and other relevant information 
in addition  various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety reporting  labeling  storage  recordkeeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these regulatory reviews and approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals for our potential products could materially adversely affect our business 

table of contents conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval are lengthy  time consuming and expensive processes 
before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products  we must demonstrate to regulatory authorities through preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans 
we will continue to incur substantial expenditures for  and devote a significant amount of time to  preclinical testing and clinical trials 
the amounts of the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties that may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources to a significant extent 
we may require substantial additional funding in order to complete our research and development activities and commercialize any potential products 
we currently estimate that our existing resources and projected interest income will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next months 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional funding prior to then or that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in our research  development and commercialization programs  the size and complexity of these programs  the timing  scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  our ability to establish and maintain corporate partnerships  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing preclinical and clinical material and other factors not within our control 
we cannot guarantee that the additional financing to meet our capital requirements will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research  development or commercialization programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose  or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we issue equity securities to raise additional funds  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
the significant amounts of capital that we are spending to provide and or enhance infrastructure  headcount and inventory in preparation for the potential launch of ranexa could be lost if we do not receive united states marketing approval for ranexa 
our ranexa commercialization efforts include building our sales and marketing infrastructure  increasing our marketing communications efforts  and planning for the hiring and training of a national sales force 
we have spent approximately million on these activities from january  through december  if the fda does not approve ranexa  these expenditures and any future commitments of capital could be lost 
the loss of this investment may harm our business  increase our cash requirements  increase the volatility of our stock price and result in additional operating losses 
in addition  if fda approval of ranexa is delayed  we will incur additional commercialization expenses at a later date to prepare for a delayed launch of ranexa 
if the fda does approve ranexa  we expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially in connection with the market launch of the product 
we cannot be certain that we will ever achieve and sustain profitability 
since our inception  we have been engaged in research  development and pre commercialization activities 
we have generated no product revenues  and must receive regulatory approval for the marketing of a product in a given jurisdiction before we can begin marketing any product and generating any product revenues 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the process of developing and commercializing our products requires significant research and development work  preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as regulatory approvals and marketing and sales efforts 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in operating losses for the foreseeable future 
even if we are able to obtain marketing approvals and generate product revenues  we may not achieve profitability 

table of contents contractual obligations and significant commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due as of december  thereafter total in thousands senior subordinated convertible debentures convertible subordinated notes capital leases manufacturing agreements operating leases under our manufacturing related agreements  additional payments above the specified minimums included in the tables above will be required if the fda approves ranexa  and in connection with the manufacture of ranexa 
our other material commitments relate to our license agreement with syntex 
under the license agreement  we paid an initial license fee 
in addition  we are obligated to make certain milestone payments to syntex  upon receipt of the first and second product approvals for ranexa in any of certain major market countries consisting of france  germany  italy  the united states and the united kingdom 
unless the agreement is terminated  in connection with the first such product approval  we will pay syntex  on or before march   million plus interest accrued thereon from may  until the date of payment 
unless the agreement is terminated  if the second product approval in one of the major market countries occurs before may   we will pay syntex  on or before march   million plus interest accrued thereon from the date of approval until the date of payment  and if the second such product approval occurs after may   but before march   we will pay syntex  on or before march   million plus interest accrued thereon from may   until the date of payment 
as of december   had we been required to accrue the million milestone  we would have accrued approximately million as interest expense 
unless the agreement is terminated  if the second product approval in one of the major market countries has not occurred by march   we will pay syntex million on or before march   and if we receive the second product approval after march   we will pay syntex million within thirty days after the date of such second product approval 
no amounts have been accrued to date in relation to these milestones 
in addition  we will make royalty payments based on net sales of products that utilize the licensed technology 
we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the product for angina 
we or syntex may terminate the license agreement for material uncured breach  and we have the right to terminate the license agreement at any time on days notice if we decide not to continue to develop and commercialize ranexa
