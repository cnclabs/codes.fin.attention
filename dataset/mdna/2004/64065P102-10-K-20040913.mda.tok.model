item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share data 
for the year ended june  statement of operations data net revenues gross profit operating expenses operating income loss foreign exchange loss loss on investment interest income  net income loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net income loss basic earnings loss per share diluted earnings loss per share weighted average number of common shares outstanding basic diluted june  balance sheet data current assets current liabilities working capital total assets total stockholders equity item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business we provide software  services and solutions to enable thin client appliance computing  which is a computing architecture targeted at business customers as an easier to manage  more secure  more reliable  and more cost effective solution than traditional pc based  client server computing 
our software and management tools secure  power and manage a new generation of smart thin client appliances that utilize the benefits of open  industry 
back to contents standard technologies used in the pc industry to create new alternatives to full function personal computers used in business  as well as green screen terminals 
our software runs on thin client appliances and personal computers  and enables these devices to be secured and centrally managed  as well as to connect to mainframes  midrange  unix  linux and legacy systems 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of thin client appliance systems  which include the appliance device and related software marketed under the brand names eon  capio  thinstar and voyager  and to a lesser extent from thinpc thin client software for pcs  teemtalk host access software for servers  ezremote manager central management software  and services such as training and integration 
we sell our products and services worldwide through our direct sales force  distributors  our alliance with ibm and other indirect channels  such as vars and systems integrators 
our international sales are primarily made through distributors and resellers and are collectable primarily in us dollars  while the associated operating expenses are payable in foreign currencies 
in addition to our headquarters in the united states  we maintain offices in the uk  germany  france  austria  sweden  australia  and the netherlands 
our international revenues  primarily from europe  were as follows in thousands international revenue as a percentage of net revenues percentage change over prior period strategy the market for thin client appliances is a subset of the enterprise pc market 
we market our thin client appliances as alternatives to personal computers in certain target markets 
our strategy is to focus on increasing sales to large enterprise customers  primarily through our relationship with ibm  and secondarily through other resellers and directly to end users  and  to execute marketing initiatives designed to grow the thin client segment of the pc industry 
we expect that the combination of these actions will result in increased revenues with overall gross profit margins in approximately the to range in fiscal financial position in fiscal our operating results were affected by several factors  including  lack of growth in the pc market  changes in the competitive landscape and contributions from the teemtalk acquisition 
in fiscal  we grew more slowly than in prior years  and responded by changing our strategy as noted above 
since we completed the acquisition of the teemtalk software business  we have increased sales of this product  which contributed to our growth and profitability 
also during the year  we spent approximately million pursuing acquisitions that were not completed 
net revenue  gross profit margin and earnings per share are key measurements of our financial results 
for fiscal  net revenue was million  an increase of from fiscal gross profit margins were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal diluted earnings per share was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  as a result of earnings leverage from revenue growth offset by the write off of abandoned acquisition costs and an additional  diluted shares outstanding primarily from the sale of stock in july during fiscal  we strengthened our balance sheet and added to our cash position 
we have a significant balance of cash and short term investments and we generated cash from operations during fiscal as of june   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  compared to million at june   which represented approximately of tangible assets 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million 
financing activities provided million in due primarily to the private placement of  shares of our common stock 
we utilize cash in ways that our management believes provides an optimal return on investment 
cash has principally been used to acquire businesses 

back to contents critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management s judgments and estimates 
these critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill accounting for income taxes these policies and estimates and our procedures related to these policies and estimates are described in detail below and under specific areas within the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations 
please refer to note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition 
for each type of arrangement  we make significant judgments regarding the fair value of multiple elements contained in our arrangements  judgments regarding whether fees are fixed or determinable  judgments regarding whether collectibility is probable  and judgments related to accounting for potential distributor stock rotation rights and price protection 
these judgments  and their effect on revenue recognition  are discussed below 
multiple element arrangements net revenues include sales of thin client appliance systems  which include the appliance device and related software  maintenance and technical support 
we follow aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  for revenue recognition because the software component of the thin client appliance system is more than incidental to the thin client appliance systems as a whole 
these products and services are sold either separately or as part of a multiple element arrangement 
revenue is recognized on product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue related to post contract support services is generally recognized with the initial product sale when the fee is included with the initial product fee  post contract services are for one year or less  the estimated cost of providing such services during the arrangement is insignificant  and unspecified upgrades and enhancements offered during the period historically have been and are expected to continue to be minimal and infrequent 
otherwise  revenue from extended warranty and post contract support service contracts is recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized over the term of the contract 
the fee is fixed or determinable we make judgments at the outset of an arrangement regarding whether the fees are fixed or determinable 
the vast majority of our payment terms are within to days after invoice date 
we review arrangements that have payment terms extending beyond days on a case by case basis to determine if the fee is fixed or determinable 
if we determine at the outset of an arrangement that the fees are not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as the fees become due and payable 
collection is probable we make judgments at the outset of an arrangement regarding whether collection is probable 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have had a history of successful collections 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process to evaluate the customer s 
back to contents financial position and ability to pay 
if we determine at the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable  revenue is recognized upon receipt of payment 
stock rotation rights and price protection we provide certain distributors with stock rotation rights and price protection 
stock rotation rights are generally limited to a maximum amount per quarter and require a corresponding order of equal or greater value at the time of the stock rotation 
we provide price protection as a rebate in the event that we reduce the price of products that our distributors have yet to sell to end users 
we estimate potential stock rotation and price protection claims based on historical experience and the level of inventories in the distribution channel and reduce current period revenue accordingly 
if we cannot reasonably estimate at the outset of an arrangement containing stock rotation rights and price protection  we recognize revenue when the claims can be reasonably estimated 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in connection with acquisitions  we allocate portions of the purchase price to intangible assets  consisting of acquired technology  distributor and customer relationships and tradenames based on independent appraisals received after each acquisition  with the remainder allocated to goodwill 
we assess the realizability of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we are required to perform a sfas no 
impairment test annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we have determined that the reporting unit level is our sole operating segment 
the test for goodwill is a two step process first  we compare the carrying amount of our reporting unit  which is the book value of the entire company  to the fair value of our reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we have to perform the second step of the process 
if not  no further testing is needed 
if the second part of the analysis is required  we allocate the fair value of our reporting unit to all assets and liabilities of our reporting units as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test 
we then compare the implied fair value of our reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess 
we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles  for impairment when events indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when we determine that one or more impairment indicators are present for an asset  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate  we compare the fair value to the book value of the asset 
if the fair value is less than the book value  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
some of the events that we consider as impairment indicators for our long lived assets  including goodwill  are significant underperformance relative to expected operating results  our net book value compared to our market capitalization  significant adverse economic and industry trends  significant decrease in the market value of the asset  the extent that we use an asset or changes in the manner that we use it  and significant changes to the asset since we acquired it 
we have not recorded an impairment loss on goodwill or other long lived assets 
at june   goodwill and amortizable intangible assets are million and million  respectively 
a decrease in the fair value of our business could trigger an impairment charge related to goodwill 

back to contents accounting for income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each federal  state and international jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities  including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our balance sheet and results of operations 
we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and  based on our assessment  establish a valuation allowance  if required 
results of operations net revenues in thousands net revenue percentage change over prior period we derive revenues primarily from the sale of thin client appliances  which include an appliance device and related software 
the increase in net revenues in fiscal reflects increases in revenue from our thin client appliance products and software 
the increases were driven by sales growth from increasing market acceptance of our thin client products and our alliance with ibm  our acquisition and growth in revenues of the teemtalk software business and increasing sales of our other software products 
the increase in net revenues in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of our thin client appliance products sold as a result of the increasing acceptance in the marketplace of thin client technology and our increased access to customers as a result of our greater market share  our alliance with ibm  and our larger sales organization 
while we believe that the increase in total net revenue achieved in recent periods is not necessarily indicative of future results  we expect total net revenue to increase in fiscal  as a result of increased penetration of the pc market and continued growth of our relationship with ibm  relatively consistent with the growth levels experienced during fiscal we believe that we are seeing positive initial results from the new marketing and product strategies that we initiated earlier this year  and believe that if we can successfully implement these initiatives  our revenues may grow at a faster rate 
additionally  we completed only one acquisition in our fiscal if we complete additional acquisitions in fiscal  our revenues may grow at a faster rate 
cost of revenues and gross profit margin in thousands cost of revenue percentage change over prior period gross profit margin cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of thin client appliances  which include an appliance device and related software  and  to a lesser extent overhead including salaries and related benefits for personnel who fulfill product orders  deliver services and distribution costs 
the increase in cost of revenues in fiscal is primarily the result of sales growth and lower material costs 
the increase in cost of revenues in fiscal is primarily the result of increased unit sales offset by decreases in material costs 
we have benefited from manufacturing efficiencies and component cost reductions achieved through our outsourced model 
this model depends on high volume production of our thin client appliance products using components commonly used in personal computers 
we have also benefited from license fee expense reductions due 
back to contents to the acquisition of the teemtalk software business  which we previously licensed under a royalty fee agreement  and reductions in other software license fees 
the change in gross profit margin in fiscal is attributable to the increased sales of higher margin software and component cost reductions 
we expect gross margins to fluctuate or decline in the future  reflecting the introduction of new products  including our thin client appliance  changes in product mix  the mix of revenues from thin client appliance systems and software  reduction in sales prices due to increased sales to large enterprise customers increased price competition and changes in the cost of thin client appliances  memory and other components 
accordingly  in fiscal we expect gross margin to be approximately in the range of to 
sales and marketing in thousands sales and marketing as a percentage of net revenues percentage change over prior period sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  commissions  amortization of intangibles related to customer and distribution relationships and other costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts 
the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal and are primarily the result of increasing our organizational investments in the united states and europe  including personnel additions and targeted marketing initiatives designed to stimulate growth in the thin client segment of the pc market 
the increase in fiscal also reflects amortization of intangibles related to customer relationships resulting from the acquisition of the teemtalk software business 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to remain flat or decrease moderately in absolute dollars in fiscal  and to decrease as a percentage of revenues as revenues grow 
spending levels in any one quarter will vary depending upon the timing of individual marketing initiatives 
research and development in thousands research and development as a percentage of net revenues percentage change over prior period research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  and other engineering related costs 
the increase in research and development expense in fiscal is primarily the result of an increase in staff levels  including additional personnel from the acquisition of the teemtalk software business 
the increase in research and development expense in fiscal is primarily the result of an increase in staff levels 
we believe that a significant level of research and development investment is required to remain competitive and expect research and development expenses to be relatively constant  or to decrease moderately as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal general and administrative in thousands general and administration as a percentage of net revenues percentage change over prior period general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  corporate insurance  such as director and officer liability insurance  fees related to the obligations of a public company and fees for legal  audit and tax services 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal is primarily the result of an increase in staffing levels  and  to a lesser extent  increases in compensation levels  increases in fees associated with our eie tax benefit discussed below and increases in director and officer liability insurance 
in addition  fiscal and included provisions to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts to the present level  while no additional provision was required in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal is primarily the result of an increase in staffing levels 
the increase in staffing 
back to contents levels reflects additional personnel related to our organizational investments in executive management and other positions 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease moderately in absolute dollars in fiscal abandoned acquisition costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote off million in direct and incremental costs  which were previously deferred  related to acquisitions that were not consummated 
these cost consisted primarily of advisory fees  legal fees  fee associated with due diligence and accounting fees 
income taxes benefit in thousands income taxes benefit as a percentage of net revenues effective tax rate our effective tax rate in fiscal differed from the combined federal and state statutory rates due primarily to the tax benefit from the extraterritorial income exclusion eie 
the eie provides a tax benefit by excluding a portion of income from qualified foreign sales from gross income 
also during fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of  from the recovery of eie deductions in prior years 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at june  and represented of tangible assets 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at june  and represented of tangible assets 
cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid with original maturities of days or less 
short term investments consist mainly of corporate notes  government securities  and certificates of deposit 
additionally  we have a million line of credit facility with wachovia bank  all of which was available as of june  the credit facility requires us to maintain a minimum cash balance of million with the bank 
interest on the line of credit facility accrues at the libor market index rate plus and the facility matures on december  there were no borrowings under the line of credit during fiscal or cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million during fiscal  primarily as a result of the million proceeds from the sale of common stock in a private placement transaction and million in cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by the million used to acquire the teemtalk software business 
our largest source of operating cash flows is payments from our customers for the purchase of the company s products 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the purchase of thin client appliances  software licenses  personnel related expenditures and marketing expenses 
cash flows from operating activities increased in fiscal primarily due to increased collections from customers  increased intangibles amortization due to the purchase of the teemtalk software business  decreased payments to vendors  increases in prepaid income taxes  and decreases in deferred income taxes 
cash flows from operating activities increased in fiscal primarily due to increased collections from customers  increases in deferred income taxes  higher net income  higher deductions from the exercise of employee stock options  and decreases in inventory 
investing activities used million in fiscal due primarily to the purchase of short term investments and the acquisition of the teemtalk software business 
investing activities used million in fiscal due primarily to the purchase of short term investments 
financing activities provided million in fiscal due primarily to the sale of  shares of common stock in a private placement 
financing activities provided million in fiscal due primarily to the exercise of stock options and warrants 

back to contents contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of june  in thousands total product purchase obligations operating and capital leases other purchase obligations we expect to fund current operations and other cash expenditures through the use of available cash  cash from operations  funds available under our credit facility and  potentially  new debt or equity financings 
management believes that we will have sufficient funds from current cash  operations and available financing to fund operations and cash expenditures for the foreseeable future  however  we may seek additional sources of funding  including equity and or debt financing  in order to fund potential acquisitions  including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our million shelf registration  which was declared effective by the sec on september  recent accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  from time to time we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify our customer or supplier for losses incurred by the customer or supplier arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract  which may include  for example  litigation or intellectual property infringement claims 
factors affecting the company and future operating results operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and  therefore  prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition include  but are not limited to  the following our future results may be affected by industry trends and specific risks in our business 
some of the factors that could materially affect our future results include those described below 
during the past year  we have increased operating expenses significantly as a foundation for us to stimulate growth in our market  and we expect to continue incurring significant operating expenses 
if we do not increase revenues or appropriately manage further increases in operating expenses  our profitability will suffer 
our business has grown during the past three years through both internal expansion and business acquisitions  and has put pressure on our infrastructure  internal systems and managerial resources 
the number of our employees increased from employees at june  to employees at august  our new employees include a number of senior executive officers and other key managerial  technical  sales and marketing personnel 
to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to improve and expand our infrastructure  including operating and administrative systems and controls  and continue managing and integrating our personnel in an efficient manner 
our business may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively and coordinate among our executive  engineering  finance  marketing  sales  operations and customer support organizations  all of which add to the complexity of our organization and increase our operating expenses  which may grow at a faster rate than our sales 
in addition  because of the growth of our foreign operations  we now have facilities located in multiple locations  and we have limited experience coordinating a geographically separated organization 
although we have generated operating profits for the past three fiscal years  we have a prior history of losses and may experience losses in the future  which could result in the market price of our common stock declining 
although we have generated operating profits in the past three fiscal years  we incurred net losses in prior periods 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses 
our operating expenses increased during fiscal reflecting the hiring of additional key personnel as we continued to implement our growth strategy  including our plan to introduce new products to compete with pc based solutions and other thin client companies 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to maintain profitability 
if we do not maintain profitability  the market price for our common stock may decline 

back to contents our financial resources may not be enough for our capital and corporate development needs  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing 
a failure to maintain and increase our revenues would likely cause us to incur losses and negatively impact the price of our common stock 
our gross margins can vary significantly  based upon a variety of factors 
if we are unable to sustain adequate gross margins we may be unable to reduce operating expenses in the short term  resulting in losses 
our gross margins can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on average selling prices  fixed costs in relation to revenue levels and the mix of our business  including the percentage of revenues derived from thin client appliances  software  third party products and consulting services 
our gross profit margin also varies in response to competitive market conditions as well as periodic fluctuations in the cost of memory and other significant components 
the pc market in which we compete remains very competitive  and although we intend to continue our efforts to reduce the cost of our products  there can be no certainty that we will not be required to reduce prices of our products without compensating reductions in the cost to produce our products in order to maintain or increase our market share or to meet competitors price reductions 
our new marketing strategy is targeted at increasing the size of the thin client segment of the pc industry  in part by lowering prices to make thin clients more competitive with personal computers  and in addition by selling a larger percentage of products to large enterprise customers  who typically demand lower prices because of their volume purchases 
this strategy has resulted in  and is expected to continue to result in a decline in our gross margins 
if our sales do not increase as a result of these new strategies  our profitability will decline  and we may experience losses 
our business is dependent on customer adoption of thin client appliances as an alternative to personal computers  and a decrease in their rates of adoption could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues 
we are dependent on the growing use of thin client appliances to perform discrete tasks for corporate and internet based networks to increase our revenues 
if thin client appliances are not accepted by corporations as an alternative to personal computers  the result would be slower than anticipated revenue growth or even a decline in our revenues 
thin client appliances have historically represented a very small percentage of the overall pc market  and if sales do not grow as a percentage of the pc market  or if the overall pc market were to decline  our revenues may not grow or may decline 
we may not be able to effectively compete against pc and thin client providers as a result of their greater financial resources and brand awareness 
in the desktop pc market  we face significant competition from makers of traditional personal computers  many of which are larger companies that have greater name recognition than we have 
in addition  we face significant competition from thin client providers  including hewlett packard  wyse technology and other smaller companies 
increased competition may negatively affect our business and future operating results by leading to price reductions  higher selling expenses or a reduction in our market share 
our strategy to seek to increase our share of the overall pc market by targeting our core markets may create increased pressure  including pricing pressure  on certain of our thin client appliance products 
our future competitive performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to continually develop and introduce new products and services with better prices and performance than offered by our competitors  offer a wide range of products  and offer high quality products and services 
if we are unable to offer products and services that compete successfully with the products and services offered by our competitors  including pc manufacturers  our business and our operating results would be harmed 
in addition  if in responding to competitive pressures  we are forced to lower the prices of our products and services 
back to contents and we are unable to reduce our costs  our business and operating results would be harmed 
we may not be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions we may complete  which may materially adversely affect our growth and our operating results 
since june  we have made four acquisitions and entered into an alliance with ibm  and we may make additional acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
there is no assurance that we will successfully integrate future acquisitions into our business 
we may be unable to retain key employees or key business relationships of the acquired businesses  consolidate the corporate it infrastructure  combine administrative  research and development and other operations and combine product offerings  and integration of the businesses may divert the attention and resources of our management 
our failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
even if future acquisitions are successfully integrated  we may not receive the expected benefits of the transactions if we find that the business does not further our business strategy or that we paid more than what the assets were worth 
managing acquisitions and alliances requires management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
as a result  the effects of any completed or future transactions on financial results may differ from our expectations 
during fiscal we spent approximately million pursuing acquisitions that we did not complete 
we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions  and if we do not complete them  the cost of the acquisitions will impact our profitability 
our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly sales is limited  although our costs are relatively fixed in the short term and we expect our business to be affected by rapid technological change  which may adversely affect our quarterly operating results 
our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly sales is limited  which makes it difficult to predict the quarterly revenues that we will recognize 
in addition  most of our costs are for personnel and facilities  which are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we have a shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses  we may be unable to reduce our expenses quickly enough to avoid losses 
as a result  our quarterly operating results could fluctuate 
future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations based on a wide variety of factors  including linearity our quarterly sales have historically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of sales occur in the last month of the quarter 
this pattern makes prediction of revenues and earnings for each financial period especially difficult and uncertain and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition  and significant orders we are subject to variances in our quarterly operating results because of the fluctuations in the timing of our receipt of large orders 
if even a small number of large orders are delayed until after a quarter ends  our operating results could vary substantially from quarter to quarter and net income could be substantially less than expected 
conversely  if even a small number of large orders are pulled into a quarter from a future quarter  our revenues and net income could be substantially higher than expected  making it possible that sales and net income in future periods may decline sequentially 
there are factors that may affect the market acceptance of our products  some of which are beyond our control  including the following the growth and changing requirements of the thin client segment of the pc market  the quality  price  performance and total cost of ownership of our products compared to personal computers  the availability  price  quality and performance of competing products and technologies  and the successful development of our relationships with software providers  original equipment manufacturers and existing and potential channel partners 
we may not succeed in developing and marketing our software and thin client appliance products and our 
back to contents operating results may decline as a result 
because some of our products use embedded versions of microsoft windows as their operating system  an inability to license these operating systems on favorable terms could impair our ability to introduce new products and maintain market share 
we may not be able to introduce new products on a timely basis because some of our products use embedded versions of microsoft windows as their operating system 
microsoft corporation provides windows to us  and we do not have access to the source code for certain versions of the windows operating system 
if microsoft fails to continue to enhance and develop its embedded operating systems  or if we are unable to license these operating systems on favorable terms  our operations may suffer 
because some of our products use linux as their operating system  the failure of linux developers to enhance and develop the linux kernel could impair our ability to release new products and maintain market share 
we may not be able to release new products on a timely basis because some of our products use linux as their operating system 
the heart of linux  the linux kernel  is maintained by third parties 
linus torvalds  the original developer of the linux kernel  and a small group of independent engineers are primarily responsible for the development and evolution of the linux kernel 
if this group of developers fails to further develop the linux kernel  we would have to either rely on another party to further develop the kernel or develop it ourselves 
to date  we have optimized our linux based operating system based on a version of red hat linux 
if we were unable to access red hat linux  we would be required to spend additional time to obtain a tested  recognized version of the linux kernel from another source or develop our own operating system internally  which could significantly increase our costs 
actions taken by the sco group sco could impact the sale of linux as an operating system  negatively affecting sales of some of our products 
sco has taken legal action against ibm and sent a letter to  linux customers alleging that certain linux kernels infringe on sco s unix intellectual property and other rights  and that sco intends to aggressively protect those rights 
while we are not a party to any legal proceeding with sco  since some of our products use linux as their operating system  sco s allegations  regardless of merit  could adversely affect sales of such products 
sco has brought claims against certain end user customers of the linux operating system and threatened to bring claims against other end users of linux for copyright violations arising out of the facts alleged in sco s lawsuit against ibm 
some of these claims could be indemnified under indemnities we have given or may give to certain customers 
in the event that claims for indemnification are brought against the customers that we have indemnified  we could incur expenses reimbursing the customers for their costs  and if the claims were successful  for damages 
because we depend on sole source  limited source and foreign source suppliers for key components in our thin client appliance products  we are susceptible to supply shortages that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time  if at all  and result in lost sales 
in addition  if we implement an outsourcing strategy for other functions  we may fail to reduce costs and may disrupt operations 
we depend upon single source suppliers for our thin client appliance products and for several of the components in them 
we also depend on limited sources to supply several other industry standard components 
we also rely on foreign suppliers which subject us to risks associated with foreign operations such as the imposition of unfavorable governmental controls or other trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  political instability and currency fluctuations 
a weakening dollar could result in greater costs to us for our components 
severe acute respiratory syndrome and similar medical crises could also disrupt manufacturing processes and result in quarantines being imposed in the future 
we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience shortages of  or difficulties in acquiring  these components 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from the sale of thin client appliances that are bundled with our software 
third parties produce these thin client appliances for us  and we typically do not have long term supply contracts with them obligating them to continue producing products for us 
if we experience shortages of these products  or of their components  we may not be able to deliver our products to our customers  and our revenues would decline 

back to contents in addition to using third party suppliers for the manufacture of our products and supply of our components  to achieve additional cost savings or operational benefits  we may expand our outsourcing activities where we believe a third party may be able to provide those services in a more efficient manner 
if we are unable to effectively develop and implement our outsourcing strategy  we may not realize cost structure efficiencies and our operating and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if our third party service providers experience business difficulties or are unable to provide business process services as anticipated  we may need to seek alternative service providers or resume providing such business processes internally which could be costly and time consuming and have an adverse material effect on our operating and financial results 
if we are unable to continue generating substantial revenues from international sales our business could be adversely affected 
approximately of our revenues were derived from international sales during fiscal our ability to sell our products internationally is subject to a number of risks 
general economic and political conditions in each country could adversely affect demand for our products and services in these markets 
although most of our international sales are denominated in us dollars  currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower demand for our products or lower pricing resulting in reduced revenue and margins  as well as currency translation losses 
in addition  a weakening dollar has resulted in increased costs for our international operations  and could result in greater costs for our international operations in the future 
changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business in these jurisdictions 
trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements subject us to additional regulation and may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market  and increase our operating costs 
because we rely on distributors and ibm to sell our products  our revenues could be negatively impacted if these companies do not continue to purchase products from us 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract or retain distributors to market our products effectively or provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
none of our current distributors  including ibm  is obligated to continue selling our products or to sell our new products 
we cannot be certain that any distributors will continue to represent our products or that our distributors will devote a sufficient amount of effort and resources to selling our products in their territories 
we need to expand our indirect sales channels  and if we fail to do so  our growth could be limited 
approximately of our revenues for fiscal were derived from sales made directly to ibm and through our other distributors 
a significant portion of our other revenue was derived from sales to resellers 
if our distributors were to discontinue sales of our products or reduce their sales efforts  it could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  there can be no assurance as to the continued viability and financial condition of our distributors  none of which has accounted for more than of our net revenues for fiscal as a result of our alliance with ibm  we rely on ibm for distribution of our products to ibm s customers 
sales directly to ibm accounted for of our net sales during fiscal ibm is under no obligation to continue to actively market our products 
in addition to the company s direct sales to ibm  ibm can purchase the company s products through individual distributors and or resellers 
the company estimates that indirect sales to ibm and its customers have ranged from zero to of revenue in the quarters in fiscal  and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if ibm were to discontinue sales of our products or reduce its sales efforts  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our business may suffer if it is alleged or found that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others 
although we have not received any claims that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  if we were to receive such claims in the future  responding to such claims  regardless of their merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
there is no assurance  in the event of such claims  that we would be able to enter into a licensing arrangement on acceptable terms or that litigation would not occur 
in the event that there were a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products  or a successful claim 
back to contents of infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party  and we failed to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
thin client appliance products  like personal computers  are subject to rapid technological change due to changing operating system software and network hardware and software configurations  and our products could be rendered obsolete by new technologies 
the pc market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
our products could be rendered obsolete if products based on new technologies are introduced or new industry standards emerge 
we may not be able to preserve the value of our products intellectual property because we do not have any patents and other vendors could challenge our other intellectual property rights 
our products are differentiated from those of our competitors by our internally developed technology that is incorporated into our products 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  other vendors could sell products with features similar to ours  and this could reduce demand for our products  which would harm our operating results 
we may not be able to attract software developers to bundle their products with our thin client appliances 
our thin client appliances include our own software  plus software from other companies for specific markets 
if we are unable to attract software developers  and are unable to include their software in our products  we may not be able to offer our thin client appliances for certain important target markets  and our financial results will suffer 
in order to continue to grow our revenues  we may need to hire additional personnel 
in order to continue to develop and market our line of thin client appliances  we may need to hire additional personnel 
competition for employees is significant and we may experience difficulty in attracting qualified people 
future growth that we may experience will place a significant strain on our management  systems and resources 
to manage the anticipated growth of our operations  we may be required to improve existing and implement new operational  financial and management information controls  reporting systems and procedures  hire  train and manage additional qualified personnel  and establish relationships with additional suppliers and partners while maintaining our existing relationships 
we rely on the services of certain key personnel  and those persons knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace 
our products  technologies and operations are complex and we are substantially dependent upon the continued service of our existing personnel 
the loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business and profits and slow our product development processes 
except for our chairman and ceo  we generally do not have employment agreements with our key employees 
further  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees 
recent and proposed regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
we have historically used stock options as a key component of our employee compensation program 
we believe that stock options and other long term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long term stockholder value  and  through the use of vesting  encourage employee retention and allow us to provide competitive compensation packages  although in recent periods many of our employee stock options have had 
back to contents exercise prices in excess of our stock price  which could affect our ability to retain or attract present and prospective employees 
the financial accounting standards board has proposed changes to us gaap that  if implemented  would require us and other companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants 
this pending regulation would negatively impact our earnings 
in addition  new regulations implemented by the nasdaq national market requiring stockholder approval for all stock option plans  as well as new regulations implemented by the new york stock exchange prohibiting nyse member organizations from voting on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions  could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
we license our teemtalk software to other thin client providers who may choose to license alternative products from other suppliers who are not their competitors 
we license our teemtalk software  which enables thin clients to connect to legacy systems  to certain of our competitors  including wyse technology and hewlett packard 
although it is our strategy to continue to generate sales of this software by licensing it to other thin client vendors  these vendors may seek alternative products from suppliers who are not their direct competitors 
if we were to lose one or more of these customers  our revenue and profits would decline 
errors in our products could harm our business and our operating results 
because our software and thin client appliance products are complex  they could contain errors or bugs that can be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
although many of these errors may prove to be immaterial  any of these errors could be significant 
detection of any significant errors may result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or increased maintenance and warranty costs 
these problems could harm our business and future operating results 
occasionally  we have warranted that our products will operate in accordance with specified customer requirements 
if our products fail to conform to these specifications  customers could demand a refund for the purchase price or assert claims for damages 
moreover  because our products are used in connection with critical distributed computing systems services  we may receive significant liability claims if our products do not work properly 
our agreements with customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims 
however  these limitations may not preclude all potential claims 
liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
any such claims  whether or not successful  could seriously damage our reputation and our business 
if our contracts with citrix and other vendors of software applications were terminated  our it services business would be materially adversely affected 
we depend on third party suppliers to provide us with key software applications in connection with our it services business 
if such contracts and relationships were terminated  our revenues would be negatively affected 
our stock price can be volatile 
our stock price  like that of other technology companies  can be volatile 
for example  our stock price can be affected by many factors such as quarterly increases or decreases in our revenues or earnings  changes in revenues or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts  speculation in the investment community about our financial condition or results of operations and changes in revenue or earnings estimates  announcement of new 
back to contents products  technological developments  alliances  acquisitions or divestitures by us or one of our competitors or the loss of key management personnel 
in addition  general macroeconomic and market conditions unrelated to our financial performance may also affect our stock price 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of your shares 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
the issuance of additional equity securities may have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders and could lead to a decline in the price of our common stock 
any additional issuance of equity securities  including for acquisitions  may have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders 
in addition  the perceived risk associated with the possible sale of a large number of shares could cause some of our stockholders to sell their stock  thus causing the price of our stock to decline 
subsequent sales of our common stock in the open market or the private placement of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock could also have an adverse effect on the market price of the shares 
if our stock price declines  it may be more difficult or we may be unable to raise additional capital

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we earn interest income from our balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
this interest income is subject to market risk related to changes in interest rates which primarily affects our investment portfolio 
we invest in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
as of june  and  cash equivalents and short term investments consisted primarily of corporate notes and government securities  certificates of deposit  and other specific money market instruments of similar liquidity and credit quality 
due to the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio
