item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our form k dated march  for more information regarding our acquisition of eti 
recent internal business operation restructuring on october   the operating management teams of the previously separate pwpipe and eti business units were combined into a single operating management team with jerry dukes formerly senior vp operations  for eti as president 
while eti remains a separate legal entity  this new team has integrated the pwpipe and eti units into a single operating unit  utilizing the pw eagle management team 
see item directors and executive officers of the registrant for additional information regarding our management team 
concurrent with these changes in pvc operations  we transferred certain assets and liabilities of our pe pipe operations to pwpoly corp 
pwpoly 
pwpoly operates with a separate management team and has its own credit facilities with no guarantee or cross default provisions 
in order to maximize the value of pwpoly  pw eagle has announced its intention to distribute the shares of pwpoly to pw eagle shareholders 
the pe business now conducted by pwpoly had sales of approximately million in refer to page for an expanded discussion of the pwpoly business

pwpoly investment in wl plastics  inc  an extruder of pe pipe products on october   pwpoly  together with an affiliate of william blair mezzanine capital partners and members of wl plastics management team acquired the business of wl plastics  llc  for approximately million 
pwpoly acquired an equity interest in wl plastics of approximately in exchange for million in professional services rendered 
wl plastics focuses primarily on extruding large diameter polyethylene pipe with the bulk of its products currently in the inch to inch diameter sizes 
pwpoly and its affiliates do not control wl plastics  nor do they share management 
however  wl plastics and pwpoly intend to explore ways they can cooperate to benefit both companies 
on january  pwpoly invested million in wl plastics to increase our ownership percentage to 
potential spin off of pwpoly to pw eagle shareholders in connection with our restructuring  we announced our intent to spin off our shares of pwpoly to pw eagle shareholders 
if the spin off is completed  the company anticipates that it will distribute one share of pwpoly stock for each share of pw eagle stock held by those shareholders of pw eagle who beneficially own  shares or more of pw eagle stock 
those shareholders of pw eagle who beneficially own less than  shares will receive a cash distribution for each of their shares of pw eagle stock in an amount equal to the value of a share of pwpoly stock 
this distribution of pwpoly shares or cash to the shareholders of pw eagle stock is subject to final approval by an independent committee of the board of directors of pw eagle  the issuance of an opinion to the pw eagle lenders independent committee as to the value of pwpoly  the approval of the transaction by pw eagle s and certain governmental approvals and the raising of the cash necessary to make the cash distribution 
a record date for this transaction has not yet been established 
this transaction will be a taxable event for both pw eagle and its shareholders 
assuming that pw eagle is profitable in  the distribution of the pwpoly shares and the cash will be treated as a dividend to the shareholders of pw eagle 
regardless of whether or not a pw eagle shareholder receives pwpoly shares or cash in the distribution  the amount of the dividend on a per share basis will be equal to the amount of cash distributed on a per share basis 
we anticipate that the spin off will take place in the third quarter of there is no assurance that we will complete the spin off 
we intend to keep investors apprised of our progress regarding the spin off in future press releases and in our periodic reports 
marketing and customers we market our products through a combination of independent sales representatives  company salespersons and inside sales customer service representatives 
all sales representatives are primarily assigned to product lines and geographic territories 
our primary geographic market is the continental united states  hawaii  alaska and a minimal amount of shipments to selected foreign countries 
our marketing strategy focuses on providing high quality products and responsive customer service 
we believe our products enjoy wide acceptance and recognition 
generally  our products are warranted for one year 
we maintain product liability insurance to cover such warranty claims  and to date  warranty reserves have been sufficient to cover warranty claims 
our customers consist primarily of wholesalers and distributors 
we have a broad and diverse group of customers 
no customer accounted for more than of our net sales in and in competition in the pvc and pe pipe industry the plastic pipe industry is highly fragmented and competitive  due to the large number of producers and the commodity nature of the industry 
because of shipping costs  competition is usually regional  instead of national  in scope and the principal methods of competition are a combination of price  service  warranty and product performance 
we compete not only against other pvc and pe plastic pipe manufacturers  but also against ductile iron  steel  concrete and clay pipe producers 
although we believe we have lessened the commodity nature of our business through our brand name and proprietary pipe products  pricing pressure has effected our operating margins and will continue to in the future 
manufacturing and supply sources our executive offices and operating headquarters are located in eugene  oregon 
we have pvc pipe manufacturing facilities in cameron park  visalia and perris  california  columbia  missouri  hastings  nebraska  eugene  oregon  conroe  texas  west jordan  utah  buckhannon  west virginia  and tacoma and sunnyside  washington  and a pe pipe manufacturing facility in hastings  ne  and a pe distribution facility in baker city  or 
all eleven pvc pipe manufacturing facilities have compound centers where the pvc resin is precisely mixed with various waxes  colorants  uv protectants and lubricants to create the appropriate compound for each extrusion application 
we use high quality raw materials  as well as manufacturing techniques and machinery that incorporate many of the newest extrusion technologies 
compounded pvc resin is automatically transported from storage silos to the extrusion equipment by a vacuum feeding system 
pe resin comes premixed with additives and is conveyed directly from storage silos to the extruders 
extrusion is a common manufacturing process used in the production of plastic products 
during production  pvc or pe resin compound is placed in an extrusion machine  where the pvc or pe material is heated into a plastic state and pulled through a sizing apparatus to produce pipe or tubing of the desired diameter 
the newly extruded pipe or tubing is moved through a water cooling trough  marked to indicate the identity of the pipe or tubing and cut to length 
multiple warehousing and outdoor storage facilities are used to store finished product 
inventory is shipped from storage to customers by common carrier or by our vehicles 
at each phase of the manufacturing process  we strive to pay great attention to quality and production of a consistent product 
our pvc and pe pipe products are produced in compliance with consensus standards  such as american society for testing materials  american water works association and underwriter s laboratory 
we have a quality assurance program  which has its own testing lab for both resin and finished goods 
we acquire our pvc and pe resin in bulk  mainly by rail car  from primarily two sources 
during the years ended december    and  purchases of raw materials from two vendors totaled  and of total material purchases  respectively 
we strive to maintain strong relationships with our key raw material vendors to ensure the quality and availability of raw material 
we believe our relationships with our key raw material vendors are good 
however  the loss of a key supplier could have a significant impact on our business 
business seasonality due to general weather constraints in the geographic markets in which we operate  the demand for our products tends to be seasonal 
as a result  we experience fluctuations in sales  accounts receivable and inventory levels during the year 
generally our sales are weaker during the winter months  when construction is slower  and improves during the second and third quarters  when construction and development improves 
backlog our goal is to keep delivery lead times to a minimum in order to meet customer requirements  thus minimizing backlog 
our backlog on march   was approximately million of plastic pipe compared to million on march  the backlog on march  did not include the eti activity 
backlog increased by over a similar period in approximately million is from the inclusion of eti 
the balance of the increase is from the strong increase in demand for our products in the first quarter of employees we have approximately employees  are in administration  in sales and shipping and in manufacturing 
except for our production and maintenance employees at the buckhannon  west virginia facility  none of our employees are represented by a labor union  and we have never experienced any work stoppages 
item properties our executive offices and operating headquarters are located in leased office space in eugene  oregon 
our pvc pipe manufacturing and warehouse facilities are located in cameron park  visalia and perris  california  columbia  missouri  hastings  nebraska  eugene  oregon  conroe  texas  buckhannon  west virginia  west jordan  utah  and tacoma and sunnyside  washington 
we both own and lease portions of our facilities in hastings  nebraska and lease our manufacturing facilities in eugene  oregon and conroe  texas 
we lease our operating headquarters in eugene  oregon and manufacturing plants in perris  california  west jordan  utah and tacoma  washington pursuant to a long term lease agreement see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to the financial statements under item pwpoly has a manufacturing facility in hastings  nebraska and a distribution warehouse in baker city  oregon 
on december  we sold our idled manufacturing facility in phoenix  arizona for million 
proceeds from the sale  as required under our loan agreement were used to pay down long term debt 
in  we sold our hillsboro  oregon manufacturing facility and certain equipment for million 
proceeds from the sale were used to pay down long term debt 
we believe that the production capacity of our facilities is sufficient to meet our current and future needs 
the operating manufacturing facilities  as currently equipped  are operating at approximately of capacity in the first quarter of item legal proceedings we are from time to time a party to various claims and litigation matters incidental to our normal course of business 
we are not a party to any material litigation and are not aware of any threatened litigation that would have a material adverse effect on our business 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal year part ii item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol pwei

we have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock 
payment of common stock dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors  subject to our lending arrangements  which currently restrict the payment of dividends 
the board of directors plans to retain future earnings  if any  for operations and does not intend to pay common stock dividends in the near future  other than dividends issued in connection with the pwpoly spin off

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary during  our business has gone through changes and faced challenges 
on march   we acquired eti  which with net sales in of million  significantly increased the size of our business 
on october   we announced the reorganization of our operating management structure to integrate pwpipe and eti into a single operating unit 
this integration was substantially complete by december  at december   we were not in compliance with our loan agreements 
we have worked closely with our lenders and have reached agreements waiving all conditions of default and amending covenants such that we believe we will be in compliance with our agreements through march   and we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations through that date as well 
each of these matters is discussed in more detail below 
we monitor several nonfinancial indicators in evaluating our business operations and future prospects  including price of pvc and pe resin our nation s gross domestic product gdp interest rates demand for pvc and pe pipe products  and dollars per pound of pipe sold 
we provide a more detailed discussion of pvc and pe resin prices  gdp  interest rates and demand for pvc and pe pipe products under the outlook section of this discussion 
we believe main drivers of industry performance are gdp growth and supply and demand of pvc resin 
historically  our profitability has improved during periods of strong gdp growth and decreased during periods of slower growth or recession 
while gdp growth did improve in compared to  demand for pvc resin for use in pipe was unchanged  and our margins decreased 
both gdp and demand for pvc resin for use in pipe are forecasted to increase in compared to historically  our margins have increased under similar circumstances 
lb 
sold net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expense because of the volatility of selling prices for pvc pipe and the cost of pvc resin  management monitors various data in terms of dollars per pound of pipe sold 
the above table expresses financial statement items in these terms by dividing the amounts shown in the financial statements by the pounds of pipe sold in the corresponding year 
net sales per pound sold increased to lb in from lb in this increase results from the acquisition of eti  which includes sales of the ultra product line which generate more net sales per pound because they utilize less material than conventional pvc pipes  as well as an increase in the selling price of conventional pvc pipe 
cost of goods sold increased to lb in from lb in due to higher prices for our primary raw material  pvc resin 
due to competitive pressures from a relatively weak demand for pvc pipe in the nd and rd quarters  we were not able to increase our selling prices enough to cover the increase in material costs  resulting in decreased margins and gross profit 
operating expenses increased to lb in from lb in this increase is primarily from higher per pound freight costs associated with eti s ultra product line 
in  net sales per pound were basically unchanged from cost of goods sold decreased to lb from lb in as the cost of pvc resin decreased 
because we were able to keep selling prices constant while our costs decreased  our gross profit increased 
operating expenses per pound were also basically unchanged from as our costs changed in conjunction with the additional pounds sold 
results of operations the following table sets forth items from our statements of operations as percentages of net sales net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating income loss non operating expenses income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit income from continuing operations discontinued operations net income loss we posted net sales of million in  increasing from to and net sales of million in  increasing from to substantially all of the increase in net sales in is from the acquisition of eti in march of eti sales represent million or of the increase in net sales 
in  average product prices increased less than from  and pipe pounds sold increased  resulting in the increase in net sales in compared to gross profit  as a percent of net sales  decreased by in as compared to strong demand for pvc pipe led to pipe prices increasing faster than pvc resin from january through april of and margins increased 
pvc resin peaked in april and decreased over the balance of the year 
pipe prices decreased faster than pvc resin price during the traditionally strong construction period in the nd and rd quarters of due to weaker than normal demand for pvc pipe 
weak economic conditions and inclement weather in certain parts of the country were the major contributors to this decreased demand 
this drove a significant reduction in margins  offsetting the gains achieved in the first quarter 
gross profit  as a percent of net sales  increased by in as compared to gross profit percentage increased during the first nine months of due to a combination of strong demand for pipe and rising pvc resin and pipe prices 
pvc resin prices increased in the first seven months of due to a strong demand for resin and increasing raw material costs 
the strong demand for pipe in the first six months of allowed us to increase pipe prices at a greater rate than resin prices  thereby increasing our gross profit percentage 
a decrease in pvc resin and pipe prices in the second half of due to a weak economy resulted in a decrease in gross profit percentage in the fourth quarter of this offset some  but not all  of the gains achieved in gross profit percentage in as compared to in addition  the cost reduction measures taken in the second half of have reduced our cost of goods sold  further enhancing our gross profit 
decreased pipe and resin prices resulted in a lower of cost or market adjustment at year end  reducing pipe inventory and increasing cost of goods sold by million in the demand for pipe was further reduced by the reluctance of distributors to purchase pipe for inventory when pipe prices were dropping  and market conditions caused pipe prices to drop at a faster rate than resin prices 
operating expenses as a percent of net sales increased in as compared to in connection with the business restructuring implemented in the fourth quarter of  we incurred restructuring charges of million 
the balance of the increase in is primarily due to the increase in freight costs associated with eti s ultra product line 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by in as compared to the decrease is primarily the result of restructuring costs of million incurred in the third quarter of non operating expenses increased to million in from million in this increase results from increased levels of debt incurred as a result of the eti acquisition  partially offset by the gain on the sale of our idled manufacturing facility in phoenix  arizona 
the decrease in non operating expense in  compared to  is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest rates for the unhedged portion of debt  a reduction in the balance of the revolving credit facility and continued payments on the long term debt 
the income tax provision tax benefit for the years ended december   and were calculated based on management s estimates of the annual effective tax rate for the year 
the annual effective tax rate for reflects our statutory federal and applicable state tax rates of approximately  down from in the rate was impacted by rate increases in certain states in which we operate  offset by an adjustment of accruals associated with certain tax contingencies 
liquidity and capital resources in conjunction with the acquisition of eti and formation of pw poly  we entered into new credit facilities see note 
on september   we entered into a revised financing agreement with the lenders of our senior credit facility and an amended agreement with holders of the senior subordinated notes 
under the terms of the agreements  the company increased the amount of its senior term loan from million to million and decreased the annual principal payments from million to million 
the proceeds of million from the revision of the senior term loan were used to pay down the revolving credit facility to million 
changes to certain provisions in the borrowing base calculation of the senior credit facility were made to increase the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility by million 
the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility was increased from million to million between february and may of each year 
the company incurred million in additional financing costs to complete these transactions which were capitalized and will be amortized over the life of the respective loans 
under the amended agreement  the term of the senior credit facility was extended by one year to september and the interest rates were reduced by 
the company s obligations at december  under various long term debt arrangements  including the new eti senior credit facility and the new pwpoly credit facility  operating leases and other arrangements are summarized in the table below scheduled contractual obligations total after years term note senior subordinated notes financing lease obligation operating leases other notes at december   the company had a contingent liability for standby letters of credit totaling million that are issued and outstanding 
these letters of credit guarantee payment to third parties in the event the company is unable to pay in a timely manner 
standby letters of credit reduce the funds available under the revolving credit facility 
no amounts were drawn on these letters of credit as of december  on may   we amended our senior credit facility with fleet capital corp and cit group business credit to increase the amount available on the revolving credit facility to million from its previous amounts of million from september to january and million from february to may 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to  and million in and  respectively 
the key component in changes in cash flow levels is the fluctuation in inventories 
working capital decreased million to million in from million in  primarily from the increase in the revolving credit facility 
investing activities used million in  provided million in and used million in the acquisition of eti in used million in cash  and the sale of msp provided million in cash 
capital expenditures for were million 
in  we sold our hillsboro manufacturing facility and certain equipment for million  which was partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
the primary use of cash in was capital improvements 
fiscal capital expenditures of million were held to minimum required levels and are not representative of our annual requirements 
fiscal and capital expenditures of million and million  respectively  reflect a spending program more consistent with our recurring replacement needs 
financing activities provided million during the primary sources of cash were net borrowings under the senior credit facilities of eti and pwpoly and the revolving credit facility of pw pipe of million 
the company made a final payment of million to the original owners of our former hillsboro  oregon manufacturing facility 
debt issuance and financing costs of million were incurred in connection with the establishment of eti s and pwpoly s senior credit facilities 
financing activities used million in in  we entered into a sale leaseback transaction  which generated million in proceeds 
the proceeds were used to reduce the term debt by million 
the remaining proceeds of approximately million were used to pay down the revolving credit facility 
financing activities used cash of million in in  million provided from the revolving credit facility and million provided from operating activities was used to repay million in long term debt and fund the repurchase of approximately million of our common stock 
as described above  the company entered into a sale leaseback transaction agreement on february  for certain manufacturing facilities and the eugene office building 
as a result of the sale leaseback transaction  a financing lease obligation of million  net of a debt discount of million  was recorded based on the collective estimated fair value of the financing lease obligation and warrant on the date issued 
no gain or loss was recognized on the transaction 
the financing lease obligation  which expires in september  requires an annual lease payment of million  including interest at a rate of 
the financing lease includes certain financial covenants and requires the company to maintain an irrevocable letter of credit equal to one year s lease payments 
the company has a purchase option at the end of the lease term at an amount equal to the greater of the fair market value of the leased assets or million 
if the purchase option is not exercised and the company does not terminate the lease  the lease will automatically renew for a term of years 
we had commitments for capital expenditures of  at december   which we intend to fund from our revolving credit facility 
restructuring activities in response to difficult economic conditions and poor operating results  the company decided to consolidate the pwpipe and eti business units under common management control in october the former eti headquarters office in denver  colorado was closed and all administrative and accounting functions were transferred to the eugene  oregon office 
in addition  effective january  the corporate office in minneapolis  minnesota was closed and all corporate office functions were transferred to the eugene  oregon office  which now represents our corporate headquarters  expanding the previous role as our lead operating office 
as a result of the consolidation  approximately non management positions were eliminated 
in addition  certain officers and directors resigned their positions and cancelled consulting agreements 
in connection with these fiscal activities  the company expects to incur severance costs totaling  including the forgiveness of stock loans totaling  see note 
as of december   the company has incurred a charge of  for these severance costs  with the remaining charges of  expected to be incurred during the first quarter of fiscal severance payments through december  totaled  with the remaining amounts to be paid according to contractual terms extending through august restructuring charges are recorded on a separate line within operating income in the company s statement of operations 
on february   the company completed a sale of its hillsboro  oregon facility  together with certain equipment  for million 
additionally  an analysis of the carrying value of equipment not included in the sale indicated that its carrying value exceeded its net realizable value 
accordingly  the financial statements for fiscal reflect an asset impairment charge of  recorded as a component of cost of goods sold 
in july  the company announced a restructuring plan to align the company s operations with market conditions  reduce the company s fixed costs and improve profitability 
these actions included a net reduction of percent of the company s workforce  permanently closing and selling the hillsboro  oregon production facility  temporarily suspending operations of the phoenix  arizona manufacturing facility until customer demand required additional capacity and initiated focused cost reduction programs 
the related restructuring charge of million was recorded on a separate line within operating income in the company s statement of operations 
under the restructuring plan  positions were eliminated 
severance payments totaling  and  were paid to terminated employees in fiscal and  respectively 
the remaining severance payment of  will be paid during the first half of fiscal following is a summary of the restructuring reserve activity severance other total restructuring restructuring accrual at december  additions to reserve charges against reserve restructuring accrual at december  additions to reserve charges against reserve restructuring accrual at december  additions to reserve charges against reserve restructuring accrual at december  we anticipate a charge to the fiscal operating results associated with certain debt financing activities 
the amount of this charge is dependent upon the outcome of these activities

future outlook and risks to our business the statements contained in this section and statements contained in items   and a of this report on form k and the president s letter to shareholders in connection with our annual meeting of shareholders regarding our beliefs and expectations that are not strictly historical are forward looking statements made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements reflect our current expectations and beliefs as of march  and are based on information known to us and our assumptions as of that date 
these forward looking statements involve known and unknown business risks and risks that we cannot control 
as a result  our statements may not come true and our operating results may differ materially from our stated expectations and beliefs 
some of our current beliefs and expectations are discussed below along with risk factors that impact our industry and business 
forward looking statements we believe the gross domestic product gdp is closely correlated to the demand for pvc resin and pvc pipe and we recognize that our business is tied to economic cycles 
gdp increased by in  as compared to the increase in demand for pvc pipe was relatively strong in the first quarter of  however  we believe a significant portion of this demand was related to inventory increases by distributors 
during the second quarter of  as pipe prices stabilized and then began to decrease  distributors significantly reduced their inventories resulting in lower volumes for pvc pipe producers 
we believe that distributors have maintained lower inventory levels through the end of accordingly  we believe that inventory levels at resin producers  pipe producers and distributors were relatively low at the end of  making it likely that demand for pvc pipe and pvc resin will be greater than supply during the first half of  providing moderate economic growth continues 
in addition  the production of pvc may be limited by the availability of chlorine  a major raw material component of pvc resin 
chlorine capacity could be limited due to the closure of several chlorine manufacturing plants and  to our knowledge  no significant capacity has been added 
this combination of industry conditions could lead to increased product pricing and increased margins in demand for pvc resin was strong early in and pvc resin producers implemented price increases totaling eight cents per pound during the first four months of the year 
pipe producers implemented several pipe price increases during the same period in response to these resin price increases 
during the final eight months of  pvc resin prices decreased by three cents per pound in response to a weakening demand for pvc resin 
during the same period  pvc pipe prices decreased at a greater rate than pvc resin prices 
in response to increasing demand and relatively fixed current production capacity  pipe producers have implemented and announced several pipe price increases in response to resin price increases announced for the first four months of we believe these pipe price increases will have a positive impact on our margins 
over time  we expect the demand for plastic pipe to grow as acceptance of plastic pipe over metal pipe continues and the overall economy continues to grow 
industry growth projections call for annual sales growth rates for pvc pipe of three percent or greater in the actual growth rate may be less than or greater than three percent based on short term economic conditions 
our strategy has been  and continues to be  to concentrate growth initiatives in higher profit products and geographic regions 
we believe that the operational restructuring we began in the fourth quarter of has positioned the company for improved results in the future by improving our efficiency and reducing our selling  general and administrative costs 
we are continuing to pursue a financial restructuring in fiscal to reduce our interest charges 
risk factors the pipe industry and our business are heavily dependent on the price and trend of pvc resin  our main raw material 
our gross margin percentage is sensitive to pvc raw material resin prices and the demand for pvc pipe 
historically  when resin prices are rising or stable  our margins and sales volume have been higher 
conversely  when resin prices are falling  our sales volumes and margins have been lower 
during the first four months of  pvc resin producers implemented pvc price increases totaling eight cents per pound 
during the last eight months of  pvc prices decreased by three cents per pound due to a decrease in demand for pvc 
in response to increasing demand and relatively fixed current production capacity  pvc resin producers implemented a two cent per pound price increase for january and a two cent per pound price increase for february in addition  price increases of two cents per pound in march and two cents per pound in april have been announced 
our gross margin decreases when the supply of pvc resin and pvc pipe is greater than demand 
conversely  our gross margins improve when pvc resin and pvc pipe are in short supply 
in april  a major producer of pvc resin filed for bankruptcy and  during the first quarter of ceased operations at two manufacturing facilities 
this resulted in a reduction of approximately one billion pounds of production capacity  or of the north american industry capacity 
although these two facilities have subsequently been purchased by two pvc producers  we do not expect this idled capacity to re start in in addition  we believe the production of pvc resin may be limited by the availability of chlorine  a major raw material component 
the demand for our products is directly affected by the growth and contraction of the gross domestic product and economic conditions 
due to the commodity nature of pvc resin and pvc pipe and the dynamic supply and demand factors worldwide  historically the markets for both pvc resin and pvc pipe have been very cyclical with significant fluctuations in prices and gross margins 
generally  after a period of rising or stable prices  capacity has increased to exceed demand with a resulting decrease in prices and gross margins 
over the last ten years  there have been consolidations in both markets  particularly with respect to pvc resin manufacturers 
during the same period  the capacity of pvc resin producers has increased from just over billion pounds to over billion pounds today 
in the last years published pvc resin prices have fluctuated between 
and 
per pound 
currently resin prices are at or near the historical high price of 
cents per pound 
while we expect the demand for pvc pipe to continue to increase over the long term  we also expect that the industry will continue to be subject to cyclical fluctuations and times when supply will exceed demand  driving prices and margins down 
these conditions could result from a general economic slowdown either domestically or elsewhere in the world or capacity increases in either the pvc resin or pvc pipe markets 
general economic conditions both in the united states and abroad will continue to have a significant impact on our prices and gross margins 
we have a significant amount of outstanding debt and must continue to operate our business to meet our outstanding obligations 
at december   pw eagle and pwpoly were in violation of certain covenants on their revolving credit facilities and term loans 
in addition  pw eagle was in violation of certain covenant and payment defaults on its senior subordinated debt  as well as certain covenant defaults on its financing lease 
as of march   we have cured the payment default and obtained waivers of all covenant violations 
in addition  our lenders have amended their agreements such that we believe we will be in compliance with the covenants through the first quarter of we also believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations through that date 
in the event of a default  we will be required to either obtain a waiver from our lenders or amend our lending agreements 
there is no assurance that our lenders  note holders and lessors will waive any future default or agree to any future amendments of our credit facilities and leases 
if we failed to obtain a waiver or an amendment  we would be required to obtain new financing from alternative financial sources 
there is no assurance that we could obtain new financing  and if we did  there is no assurance that we could obtain terms as favorable as our current credit facilities 
interest rates affect our ability to finance our indebtedness and may adversely affect the demand for our products when higher rates slow the growth of our economy 
we financed our purchase of pwpipe in using a million senior credit facility and approximately million of senior subordinated notes 
on february   we completed a financial restructuring to reduce our floating interest rate term notes from million to million 
on september   we modified our financing agreement with the lenders of our senior credit facility 
changes to certain provisions of the senior credit facility were made to increase the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility by million 
the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility was increased from to million between february and may of each year 
we increased the amount of the senior term loan from million to million 
we used these proceeds to pay down the revolving credit facility to million 
however  even with the revisions made to the senior credit facility and the senior subordinate notes  our ability to service our debt remains sensitive to an increase in interest rates 
interest rate increases would further challenge our ability to pay the interest expense on our debt and fixed charges 
see item a 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could slow the growth of the economy and affect the demand for our products 
other risk factors in addition to the risk factors discussed above  our business is also affected by the following i adverse weather conditions that result in a slow down in construction and the demand for our products  ii competition in the pvc resin and pipe industry that puts pressure on the price of pvc resin and the demand for pvc pipe  and iii net operating loss utilization 
for financial reporting purposes  the company s cumulative deferred tax asset recorded in prior years totaling approximately million associated with net operating loss carryforwards  has been fully utilized  including approximately million in the first half of we have evaluated tax reporting compliance relating to the past and fiscal utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards  and believe we have complied in all respects 
a failure to meet the requirements could result in a loss or limitation of the utilization of carryforwards  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
we have not provided any valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets of approximately million at december  the matter and associated risk of a significant change in our reported financial condition are discussed under critical accounting policies below 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the recorded values of certain assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies and areas that require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements include allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts necessary to maintain the allowance at a level estimated to be sufficient to absorb future losses due to accounts that are potentially uncollectible 
the allowance is based on our historical experience with prior year write offs  aging of past due accounts  financial condition of the customer and the general economic conditions of our market place 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions resulting in an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method and includes materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
judgment by management is required to determine both replacement cost and market 
we recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment in the fourth quarter of  and  reducing pipe inventory values by million  million  and million  respectively 
a change in this management estimate would impact cost of goods sold and the inventory carrying value 
property equipment and goodwill management periodically reviews its long lived and intangible assets and goodwill for impairment and assesses whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of that asset and its eventual disposition 
the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded  if any  is calculated by the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
management also periodically reassesses the estimated remaining useful lives of its long lived assets 
changes to either estimated future undiscounted cash flows or useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment by management is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased  an expense within the tax provision is included in the statement of operations 
although the company is highly cyclical in terms of its industry and operating profits  management believes that the company will be profitable over its operating cycle  based on historical results and other analysis 
this belief is largely based on a combination of the company s participation as one of the pvc pipe industry leaders  distribution centered on populated growth markets  professional management dedicated to the pvc pipe industry and debt paydown and corresponding reduction in financing costs 
the company s cyclicalness and corresponding operating results are significantly influenced by the overall us economic cycles  which  in addition to driving demand for the company s products  also influence the cost of the primary raw material input  pvc resin 
generally  as pvc resin costs are rising during our operating cycles  our profitability associated with product shipments increases 
this is the result of demand  and gross margins used in product pricing being applied to increasing overall productivity costs 
these factors have been considered as part of the company s evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets 
the company will continue to monitor the need for a valuation allowance at each balance sheet date in  to ensure the conclusions reached in are sustainable 
any change in this conclusion would result in a direct reduction of our reported results from operations  and could result in virtual elimination of our shareholders equity as of the date of the potential determination of the need for such a valuation allowance for financial reporting purposes 
insurance liability we self insure a portion of our employees for health and dental related claims and record a claims liability based on claims history 
the liability is based on analysis of our historical claim activity and reporting trends 
while management believes that the insurance liability is adequate at year end  results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
worker s compensation liability we maintain an insurance liability for incurred and not paid and incurred but not reported employee related injuries 
the liability is based on analysis of our historical claim activity and reporting trends 
while management believes that the worker s compensation liability is adequate at year end  results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
warranty liability the provision for expenses related to product warranty is reviewed regularly 
warranty liabilities are estimated using historical information on the frequency and average cost of warranty claims 
management studies trends of warranty claims to improve pipe quality  pipe installation techniques and minimize future claims 
while management believes that the warranty liability is adequate at year end  results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results
