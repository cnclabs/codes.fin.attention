utility operations electric the company provides jurisdictional retail electric service to a large area of north central new mexico  including the coa and the city of santa fe  and certain other areas of new mexico 
the largest retail electric customer served by the company accounted for approximately of the company s total retail electric revenues for the year ended december  for the years through  retail mwh sales have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 
the company s system peak demands for its retail customers and firm requirements customers in the summer and the winter for the last three years are shown in the following table system peak demands megawatts summer    winter    the company holds long term  non exclusive franchise agreements for its electric retail operations  which will expire between december and november these franchise agreements allow the company to access public rights of way for placement of the company s electric facilities 
the coa  city of santa fe  bernalillo county  sandoval county  san miguel county  village of bosque farms  pueblo de cochiti  village of tijeras  mckinley county and the city of las vegas franchise agreements have expired 
the company remains obligated under new mexico state law to provide service to customers in these franchise areas despite the absence of an effective franchise agreement 
the coa metropolitan area accounted for approximately of the company s total electric utility operating revenues  and no other franchise area represents more than approximately 
the company continues to collect and pay franchise fees to the coa  city of santa fe  the town of cochiti  village of bosque farms  village of tijeras and the city of las vegas 
the company currently does not pay franchise fees to bernalillo county  luna county  sandoval county  mckinley county  pueblo de cochiti and san miguel county 
gas gas operations distributes natural gas to most of the major communities in new mexico  including the coa and the city of santa fe 
the coa metropolitan area accounted for approximately of the total gas revenues in no single sales service customer accounted for more than of the company s therm sales in the company holds long term  non exclusive franchises with varying expiration dates in all incorporated communities requiring franchise agreements except for the coa  city of santa fe  aztec  village of bosque farms  town of cochiti lake  los ranchos de albuquerque and tatum 
the company remains obligated to serve these franchise areas pursuant to state law despite the absence of an effective franchise agreement 
the company s customer base includes both sales service customers and transportation service customers 
sales service customers purchase natural gas and receive transportation and delivery services from the company for which the company receives both cost of gas and cost of service revenues 
cost of gas revenues collected from sales service customers are recovered in accordance with prc regulations through the company s pgac and represent a pass through of the company s cost of natural gas to the customer 
therefore  the company s operating results are not affected by an increase or decrease in natural gas prices 
additionally  the company makes occasional gas sales to off system sales customers 
off system sales deliveries generally occur at pipeline interconnects with the company s system and profits are shared between the company and its customers on a sharing basis 
a final order was issued in that approved an agreement among the parties regarding pnm s hedging strategy and the implementation of a price management fund program which includes a continuous monthly balancing account with a carrying charge 
this carrying charge has the effect of keeping pnm whole on gas purchase transactions since it is now compensated for the time value of money 
the company had approximately transportation service customers in  which procure gas for their end users independently of the company s end users 
transportation service customers are gas marketers and producers contracting with the company for transportation services to their end users and for other related services that provide the company with cost of service revenues only 
transportation services are provided to transportation service customers at locations throughout the company s distribution systems  as well as points on and off the company s transmission pipelines 
the company provided gas transportation deliveries to approximately  transportation end users during in  approximately of the company s total gas throughput was related to transportation gas deliveries 
the company s transportation rates are unbundled  and transportation customers only pay for the service they receive 
in  revenues from transportation customers accounted for approximately of the company s total gas revenue 
revenues from sales customers account for the remaining 
of this percentage  is related to the cost of gas on which the company makes no margin 
because a major portion of the company s load is related to heating  levels of therm sales are affected by the weather 
approximately of the company s total therm sales in occurred in the months of january  february  march and december 
the company obtains its supply of natural gas primarily from sources within new mexico by contracting with third party producers and marketers 
these contracts are generally sufficient to meet the company s peak day demand 
the company serves certain cities  which depend on el paso natural gas company or transwestern pipeline company  for transportation of gas supplies 
because these cities are not directly connected to the company s transmission facilities  gas transported by these companies is the sole supply source for those cities 
such transportation is regulated by ferc 
as a result of ferc order  the company s options for transporting gas to these cities and other portions of its distribution system have increased 
transmission the company owns or leases  circuit miles of transmission lines  interconnected with other utilities in new mexico  east and south into texas  west into arizona  and north into colorado and utah 
due to rapid load growth in the company s service territory in recent years and the lack of transmission development  most of the capacity on this transmission system is fully committed and there is very little or no additional access available on a firm commitment basis 
these factors result in physical constraints on the system and limit the ability to wheel power into the company s service area from outside of new mexico 
wholesale operations the company s wholesale operations consist of the generation and sale of electricity into the wholesale market based on three product lines  which are long term contracts  forward sales and short term sales 
long term contracts include sales to firm requirements and other wholesale customers with multi year arrangements 
these contracts range from to year terms with an average term of years 
forward sales include third party purchases in the forward market that range from month to years 
these transactions do not qualify as normal sales and purchases as defined in sfas and as a result  are marked to market 
short term sales generally include spot market  hour ahead  day ahead and week ahead contracts with terms of days or less 
also included are sales of any excess generation not required to fulfill pnm s retail load and contractual commitments 
short term sales also cover the revenue credit to retail customers as specified in the global electric agreement see note commitments and contingencies global electric agreement in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the wholesale operations strategy calls for increased net asset backed energy sales supported by long term contracts in the wholesale market  whereby the company s aggregate net open forward electric sales position  including short term sales  forward sales and long term contracts  is covered by its forecasted excess generation capacity 
the net asset backed sales are actively monitored by management by the use of stringent risk management policies 
the company s future growth plans call for approximately of its new generation portfolio to be committed through long term contracts  including sales to retail customers 
the threshold is in compliance with the global electric agreement 
growth will be dependent on market development and on the company s ability to generate funds for the company s future expansion 
although the current economic environment has led the company to scale back its expansion plans  the company continues to operate in the wholesale market and seek appropriately priced asset additions 
expansion of the company s generating portfolio will depend on the company s ability to acquire favorably priced assets at strategic locations and to secure long term commitments for the purchase of power from the acquired plants 
power sales in  the company s revenues from the wholesale marketplace stabilized following the preceding years when volatility was high 
the years and saw high volatility combined with high power prices 
during  power prices declined significantly due to lower natural gas prices  an average pacific northwest hydro generation year  an increase in new generation coming on line  and a shift by various large california utilities to long term contracts rather than spot market purchases 
the year continued the trend of  except that power prices were generally higher due primarily to higher natural gas prices and abnormally hot summer temperatures in the southwestern united states 
while price volatility has remained low over the years and  the company has been successful in developing its wholesale power marketing activities in the western united states 
management believes this success is due to its niche business strategy of providing electric power customized to meet the special needs of its customers 
this niche marketing strategy is based on the company s net asset backed methodology  which can help to mitigate the risks inherent in the company s wholesale power marketing activities 
the company also utilizes long term transactions to enhance its product offerings 
certain company generation assets are excluded from retail electric rates 
as a result  the company developed a wholesale power marketing strategy to sell the generation from its assets that are excluded from rate base 
this strategy also includes the forward purchase and sale of electricity to take advantage of market price opportunities in the electric wholesale market 
during  and  the company s sales in the wholesale electric markets accounted for approximately  and respectively  of its total mwh sales 
of the total wholesale electric sales made in  and   and respectively were transacted through purchases for resale 
in  the nmpuc established an off system sales methodology that provided for a sharing mechanism whereby a certain amount of revenues from off system sales were credited to reduce retail cost of service 
off system sales above the amounts credited to retail customers accrue to the benefit of shareholders 
subsequent rate cases continued to utilize this methodology 
in january  the prc approved the global electric agreement which sets a rate path through pnm agreed to decrease retail electric rates by in two phases over three years 
the first phase of the rate reductions became effective in september in addition  certain plant and purchased power contracts previously excluded from retail rates are now included as generation resources to serve pnm s new mexico retail and firm wholesale requirements customers load 
these resources include san juan unit and pnm s contracts to purchase power from sps  tri state and delta 
pvngs unit remains excluded as are the lordsburg and afton plants 
see note commitments and contingencies global electric agreement in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has entered into various firm wholesale electric sales contracts 
these contracts contain fixed capacity charges in addition to energy charges 
capacity charges are fixed monthly payments for a commitment of resources to service the contract requirements 
energy charges are payments based on the amount of electricity delivered to the customer intended to compensate the company for its variable costs incurred to provide the energy 
the company s firm requirements demand was mw in  and is expected to be mw in  mw in  mw in and mw in no firm requirements wholesale customer accounted for more than of the company s total electric sales for resale revenues for the year ended december  corporate and other the holding company performs substantially all of the corporate activities of pnm 
these activities are billed to pnm on a cost basis to the extent they are for the corporate management of pnm and these costs are allocated to the operating segments 
the holding company s wholly owned subsidiary  avistar  was formed in august as a new mexico corporation and is currently engaged in certain unregulated and non utility businesses 
in january  avistar was dividended by pnm to the holding company pursuant to an order from the prc 
sources of power as of december   the total net generation capacity of facilities owned or leased by the company was  mw  or  mw including the operating lease and wind generation facility discussed below 
the company is committed to increasing the utilization of the major generation capacity at sjgs  four corners and pvngs 
sjgs is operated by the company 
sjgs s equivalent availability and capacity factor were and respectively  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to and  respectively for capacity factors for four corners and pvngs were and  respectively  in  as compared to and  respectively  in four corners and pvngs are operated by aps 
see item properties 
the company s lordsburg and afton plants became fully operational in these plants were not built to serve new mexico retail customers and  therefore  are not currently included in the rate base 
however  it is possible that these plants may be needed in the future to serve the growing retail load 
if so  these plants would have to be certified by the prc and would then be subject to inclusion in the company s rate base in the following rate case 
these plants were built in furtherance of the company s ongoing strategy of increasing generation capacity over time to serve increasing retail load  sales under long term contracts and other sales 
in addition to generating its own power  the company purchases power in the market 
the company s purchase contract capacity  including the contracts described below  was mw in and is expected to be mw in  mw in  mw in  and mw in the company also purchases power in the forward  day ahead and real time market 
in  the company entered into an operating lease agreement for the rights to all the output of the delta gas fired generating plant for years 
the plant received ferc approval for exempt wholesale generator status 
the maximum dependable capacity under the lease is mw 
in july  the plant went into operation 
the gas turbine generating unit is operated by delta and is located on the company s retired person generating station site in the coa 
the site for the generating unit was chosen  in part  to provide needed benefits to the company s constrained transmission system 
primary fuel for the gas turbine generating unit is natural gas provided by wholesale gas purchases 
in addition  the unit has the capability to utilize low sulfur fuel oil if natural gas is neither available nor cost effective 
in  the company entered into an agreement with fpl  a subsidiary of fpl group  inc  to develop a mw wind generation facility in new mexico 
the company began receiving commercial power from the project in june fpl energy owns and operates the nmwe  which consists of wind powered turbines on a site in eastern new mexico 
the company has a contract to purchase all the power generated by the nmwe for years 
in  the company received approval from the prc for a voluntary tariff that allows pnm retail customers to buy wind generated electricity for a small monthly premium 
power from the facility is used to service load under the voluntary tariff and as part of the company s electric supply mix for meeting retail load 
any wind generated electricity in excess of these amounts is sold on the wholesale power market  either within new mexico or outside the state 
market reach in addition to owning purchased power contracts  the company owns firm transmission capacity to the mead market hub in the amount of mw  which serves various wholesale power markets and loads in the greater las vegas  nevada area  and serves as an injection point for the california iso 
in addition  the company owns transmission capacity to serve major load centers in the phoenix  arizona area in the amount of mw 
fuel and water supply the percentages of the company s generation of electricity on the basis of kwh fueled by coal  nuclear fuel and gas and oil  and the average costs to the company of those fuels in cents per million btu  during the past three years were as follows coal nuclear gas and oil percent of average percent of average percent of average generation cost generation cost generation cost the generation mix for is expected to be coal  nuclear and gas and oil 
due to locally available natural gas and oil supplies  the utilization of locally available coal deposits and the generally abundant supply of nuclear fuel  the company believes that adequate sources of fuel are available for its generating stations into the foreseeable future 
coal see note commitments and contingencies coal supply in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
natural gas the natural gas used as fuel for the electric generating plant located in coa reeves station and the delta operating lease is procured on the open market and delivered by gas through its transportation services 
the company s wholesale operations procures its gas supply independently of gas but obtains gas transportation services from gas 
nuclear fuel the company is one of several participants in pvngs 
see note construction program and jointly owned plants in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fuel cycle for pvngs is comprised of the following stages o mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates  o conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride  o enrichment of uranium hexafluoride  o fabrication of fuel assemblies  o utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors  and o storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
the pvngs participants have contracted for all of pvngs requirements for uranium  uranium concentrates and conversion services through the pvngs participants have also contracted for all of pvngs enrichment services through and fuel assembly fabrication services until at least the plant used by pvngs for conversion services has been shut down due to operational problems 
it is not currently known when that plant will resume operations 
pvngs is working to assure that adequate amounts of uranium hexafluoride are available to support the unit fall refueling and subsequent refueling 
water supply see note commitments and contingencies water supply in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
rates and regulation pnm is subject to the jurisdiction of the prc  with respect to its retail electric and gas rates  service  accounting  issuance of securities  construction of major new generation and transmission facilities and other matters regarding retail utility services provided in new mexico 
the ferc has jurisdiction over rates and other matters related to wholesale electric sales and cost recovery for a portion of its transmission network 
the ferc has begun to take more aggressive action with regard to the exercise of its jurisdictional authority over wholesale electric sales 
in february  in response in part to the allegations of wrong doing in the california spot market  the ferc announced it was establishing the omoi as one prong of its strategic plan 
the stated purpose of the ferc omoi is to engage in the vigilant oversight of energy markets to ensure effective regulation and remediation of market problems  while vigorously enforcing compliance with the ferc s rules and regulations 
the ferc has moved forward to staff its omoi and it is now a fully functioning branch of the ferc 
sec ruling enron puhca of on december   the sec issued an order affirming an administrative law judge alj decision that enron was not entitled to an exemption from the public utility holding company act because it had failed to establish that its utility subsidiary  portland general electric pge  was predominantly intrastate in character and operates substantially in a single state 
in reaching its decision  the sec considered a number of factors  including the amount of generating and transmission plant owned  the percentage of gross revenues earned from out of state operations in the previous three years and the impact of the holding company on state regulation 
pnm resources has claimed an exemption from puhca since it was established as a holding company 
filings for continued exemption must be made annually 
the company filed its claim for exemption on february  electric rates and regulation ferc mandated regional transmission organizations with the passage of the public utility regulatory policies act of and the energy policy act of  there has been a significant increase in the level of competition in the market for the generation and sale of electricity 
barriers have been reduced for companies wishing to build  own and operate electric generating facilities 
in  the ferc issued order requiring electric utilities controlling transmission facilities to file open access transmission tariffs  which opened the utility transmission systems to wholesale sellers and buyers of electric energy on a non discriminatory basis 
order also encouraged utilities to investigate the formation of isos to operate transmission assets and provided guidance for the formation  operation and governance of isos 
in  the ferc issued order on rtos  which established timelines for transmission owning entities to join an rto and defined the minimum characteristics and functions of an rto 
pnm  along with other rtos  originally pursued the formation of an rto through desert star  a non profit organization 
because of the ferc s subsequent acceptance of a for profit rto model and because a for profit rto was viewed as having the proper motivation to efficiently facilitate competitive markets  pnm  together with the rtos  in october  filed a request with ferc seeking a declaratory order 
that filing sought an order that a proposed for profit transmission company that adopted the procedures and tariff set forth in the filing would meet the criteria of order the proposed company would be a limited liability company named westconnect rto  llc westconnect 
there were over intervenors in the westconnect docket  including the new mexico attorney general  new mexico industrial energy consumers and the prc  which filed comments or concerns regarding westconnect s declaratory order petition 
in october  the ferc issued its declaratory order in the case providing guidance and conditions under which the proposal for formation of the westconnect rto would be deemed to satisfy the ferc s requirements for rto status under its order several parties to the proceeding  including pnm as a proposed member of westconnect  filed motions for rehearing and clarification of the ferc s declaratory order 
on december   the ferc issued its order granting in part and denying in part the requests for rehearing and provided clarification on certain issues raised by the parties in the case 
this order on rehearing provided for certain filings that need to be made by westconnect s proposed participants 
on january   the westconnect participants requested further clarification and rehearing of the ferc s order of december  on september   ferc issued its order granting clarification and rehearing in part 
in july  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking  which if approved  would modify order by instituting a standard market design smd for electric wholesale markets 
the westconnect participants and many other interested parties filed comments that questioned the assumptions supporting the smd proposal and objected to many of its provisions 
prior to any additional action on the smd proposal  the ferc  issued a white paper that expressed flexibility from the smd proposal in april based on the white paper  the westconnect participants are evaluating several options they may pursue in order to comply with orders and as a result of the white paper  technical conferences are being held throughout the united states 
the westconnect participants  including pnm  and other interested parties participated in such a technical conference in september in addition  the white paper stated that if it is demonstrated that the costs of implementing any feature of the smd outweigh its benefits  the ferc would not require the rto to implement that feature 
the westconnect participants and other utilities have authorized a cost benefit study to be completed to examine the cost benefit of the various features of the smd 
the cost benefit study has commenced with the initial findings expected to be completed during the first quarter of the ferc has not set a schedule for additional proceedings involving the smd issues as modified by the white paper 
as part of the cost benefit evaluation  the westconnect applicants and others are studying a phased approach to implementing an rto 
under the phased approach  the cost benefit relation of each phase would be studied to determine if the benefits for each phase would justify the costs associated with the implementation of that phase 
uncertainty continues to exist regarding the ferc s evolving rto policy 
pnm  together with the westconnect participants  is continuing to monitor the various activities and exploring its options 
el paso electric afton generating station matter with the company s construction of afton  pnm representatives have been engaged in a ferc proceeding with el paso to obtain transmission capacity on el paso s transmission system to transmit mw of power generated at afton  north to pnm s load center 
el paso had originally executed an agreement to transmit only mw of power on a firm service basis and offered to supply an additional mw of contingent transmission service 
at pnm s request in the ferc proceeding  el paso filed with the ferc an unexecuted transmission service agreement to provide mw of contingent transmission service to pnm 
in november  pnm filed a protest with the ferc  challenging el paso s denial of pnm s request for the full mw of transmission service 
in an order issued by the ferc in december  ferc ordered the matter to be set for hearing 
in july  el paso and pnm jointly moved to suspend the procedural schedule advising that they had reached a settlement in principle that would resolve all issues in this proceeding 
in november  el paso and pnm reached agreement on the terms under which the issues in this proceeding would be settled  and a settlement agreement settlement between el paso and pnm was filed at the ferc 
under the terms of the settlement  el paso will provide pnm with mw of firm transmission service as defined in the settlement from afton to el paso s point of interconnection with pnm at the west mesa switching station 
in addition  el paso will determine whether it can provide an additional mw of transmission service without facility upgrades 
the settlement provides for mw of the transmission service to be provided under the existing mw service agreement under the el paso open access transmission tariff oatt  and the remaining mw of transmission service subject to increase to mw to be provided in accordance with the rates  terms and conditions of el paso s oatt  except as specified in the settlement 
additionally  the settlement specifies that the mw of service is generation dependent  under the terms of the settlement 
the ferc commission trial staff filed comments in support of the settlement stating it achieves a reasonable resolution of the issue for the customer s benefit 
peoples energy resources company  llc peoples energy  which had previously tried but was unsuccessful in an attempt to intervene in this proceeding  filed comments opposing the settlement arguing that it violates the ferc s policy on non discriminatory  open access transmission because the settlement provides pnm with generation dependent transmission service that is different from the services available to all transmission customers under el paso s oatt 
pnm filed reply comments in opposition to the peoples energy comments 
the ferc commission trial staff also filed reply comments to people s energy comments arguing that since peoples energy is not a party to the proceeding  the settlement should be certified as an uncontested settlement 
on december   the ferc alj issued a certification of uncontested settlement stating that the settlement provides a reasonable solution to the issues in the proceeding 
he also advised the ferc that a non party ie  peoples energy raised policy issues with the settlement that may influence whether it should be adopted  even though it is uncontested 
on february   the ferc approved the settlement 
ferc rulemakings over the past couple of years  the ferc has issued numerous rulemakings that have an impact on the wholesale energy business 
pnm has followed the rulemakings and either has or will submit comments either individually or in conjunction with the edison electric institute eei or the american gas association aga 
the westconnect members have also followed these rulemakings  attended workshops and commented on the rulemakings  which affect the member companies  including pnm 
one rulemaking of particular interest to pnm is the smd rule  in which the ferc is attempting to remedy what it sees as undue discrimination in the provision of interstate transmission services  and to ensure just and reasonable rates for electric energy within and among regional power markets 
the proposed rule would put all transmission customers  including bundled retail customers  under new pro forma transmission rates for new transmission service 
all transmission would be operated under independent transmission providers including rtos and congestion management would be handled under locational marginal pricing with tradable congestion revenue rights 
see mandated regional transmission organization above for further discussion 
in addition  the ferc has issued final rules in other pending rulemakings that pnm monitored and participated in  either alone or in conjunction with the westconnect participants 
these ferc rules likewise have an impact on the wholesale energy business and participants in the wholesale energy markets  including pnm 
the ferc issued its final rule on standardized generator interconnection procedures  which requires electric utilities that own or control electric transmission facilities to set out standard procedures and a standard agreement for interconnecting generators larger than mw  and to make such revisions as necessary to its oatt to comply with the requirements of the new rule 
in october  the ferc issued an order delaying the effective date of its final rule until january   and delaying the date for companies to make their compliance filings to the same date 
pnm has made its compliance filing and will continue to monitor the implementation of the requirements 
in november  the ferc issued two orders amending blanket sales certificates to establish what it termed market behavior rules for resellers of natural gas and electricity 
the orders apply to all holders of blanket market certificates  which allow them to engage in the resale of natural gas or electricity in interstate commerce  including pnm 
the orders require all holders of blanket market certificates to comply with the ferc s rules for engaging in wholesale sales in interstate commerce as a condition of their market based rate authority 
the orders establish rules that prohibit certain market conduct that the ferc deemed to be market manipulation  and established reporting and record keeping requirements 
the order required holders of blanket market certificates to notify the ferc whether they report transaction information to publishers of electric or natural gas price indices 
pnm complied with the notification requirement under the order and has been  and continues to be  in compliance with the requirements of the market behavior rules 
in november  the ferc issued its final rule adopting standards of conduct for electric and natural gas transmission providers 
the final rule expands on the ferc s prior orders establishing standards of conduct and combines the prior electric and natural gas standards so that there is now one standard for both electric and natural gas transmission providers 
the revised standards of conduct generally continue the requirement of transmission providers  including pnm  to treat all transmission customers  affiliated or non affiliated  on a non discriminatory basis  and prohibits transmission providers from operating their system to preferentially benefit an energy or marketing affiliate 
the rule became effective on february   and all entities are to be in compliance by june  the ferc s order established a requirement for transmission providers to make a filing  indicating whether they believe they are in compliance with the final rule by february   and if not  identify a plan and schedule for implementing the requirements of the final rule  and the projected costs to come into compliance 
pnm made the required february  compliance filing stating that under its current organizational structure  it is in compliance with the ferc order and the accompanying regulations as currently drafted 
in cases involving several regional utilities  the ferc in november announced a new test it was planning to use as a screen to determine if applicants for market based rate mbr authority could potentially exercise horizontal generation based market power 
for those applicants that failed the screen  known as the supply margin assessment sma screen  the ferc would deny the mbr application or condition its approval with certain mitigation requirements to address the market power concern 
after motions for rehearing and concerns expressed by industry groups  including eei  the ferc did not immediately implement the sma screen 
in december  the ferc staff issued a white paper that contained alternatives to the sma screen test and ferc held a technical conference wherein market participants had an opportunity to provide comments on the staff white paper 
the company participated in the comments filed by eei identifying concerns with the sma screen and proposed alternatives 
ferc has not  to date  revised its sma screen to be applied to make market power determinations in mbr applications 
the company will be making its three year market power study as part of its application to renew its mbr authority in march the company is unable to predict at this time whether ferc will move forward to change its sma screen or if pnm s mbr authority will be granted or conditionally renewed 
prc renewable resources rulemakings the prc issued a renewable resources rule in december to encourage the development of renewable energy in new mexico 
the rule includes a provision requiring the use of a minimum of renewable energy by january   with the minimum amount to increase per year for each year until a renewable portfolio standard of is reached in the year the rule also provides that each kilowatt hour of electricity generated by solar technology will count as three kwhs and each kilowatt hour generated by bio mass  geothermal landfill gas  or fuel cell sources will count as two kwhs 
all remaining sources of renewable energy  including wind and hydroelectric technologies  will count as one kwh for each kwh generated 
the rule also requires utilities to offer a voluntary renewable energy tariff 
el paso electric filed an appeal with the new mexico supreme court seeking to reverse the final order 
pnm did not join the appeal 
pnm expects the appeal will be withdrawn as a result of legislation passed by the new mexico legislature in the new mexico legislature has passed legislation that would establish a mandatory renewable energy portfolio standard similar to the structure established by the prc in its rulemaking 
senate bill  the renewable energy act  would provide for streamlined proceedings for utilities to get approval of procurement plans and would require the prc to establish a reasonable cost threshold for the procurement of renewable energy to prevent excessive costs being added to rates 
under the bill  if renewable energy cannot be acquired under the threshold  the mandate would be suspended 
the bill provides certainty to utilities and protection for customers 
pnm has collaborated with environmental groups  the prc  the governor s office  other state agencies  consumer groups  and renewable energy producers in drafting the bill 
the bill would require the prc to revise its rule to eliminate any inconsistencies with the new law

the clean air act on july   the epa published its final regional haze regulations 
the purpose of the regional haze regulations is to address regional haze visibility impairment in the class areas in the nation  which consist of national parks  wilderness areas and other similar areas 
the final rule calls for all states to establish goals and emission reduction strategies for improving visibility in all the class areas 
the company cannot predict at this time what the impact of the implementation of the regional haze rule will be on the company s coal fired power plant operations 
potentially  additional so emission reductions could be required in the timeframe 
the nature and cost of compliance with these potential requirements cannot be determined at this time 
however  the company does not anticipate any material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
person station the company  in compliance with a corrective action directive issued by the nmed  determined that groundwater contamination existed in the deep and shallow groundwater at the company s person station site 
the company is required to delineate the extent of the contamination and remediate the contaminants in the groundwater at the person station site 
the extent of shallow and deep groundwater contamination was assessed and the results were reported to the nmed 
the company has received the renewal of the rcra post closure care permit for the facility 
remedial actions for the shallow and deep groundwater were incorporated into the new permit 
the company has installed and is operating a pump and treatment system for the shallow groundwater 
the renewed rcra post closure care permit allows remediation of the deep groundwater contamination through natural attenuation 
the company s current estimate to decommission its retired fossil fueled plants discussed below includes approximately million in additional expenses to complete the groundwater remediation program at person station 
the remediation program continues on schedule 
retired fossil fueled plant decommissioning costs the company s retired fossil fueled generating stations  person  prager and santa fe stations  have incurred dismantling and reclamation costs as they are decommissioned

nevertheless  the company is subject to varying degrees of competition in certain territories adjacent to or within the areas it serves with other utilities in its region as well as with rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities 
the company s wholesale operations is involved in the generation and sale of electricity into the wholesale market 
it is subject to competition from regional utilities with similar opportunities to generate and sell energy at market based prices and larger trading entities that do not own or operate generating assets 
the company believes that it is well positioned to compete in this market due to its long history in the marketplace  its niche product offerings  and stringent risk management practices 
the company s energy marketers are operationally trained and maintain effective marketing relationships with its competitors and counterparties 
additionally  the company has maintained an investment grade rating despite turbulent wholesale markets  which enables the company to fully participate in the marketplace

units and at four corners are jointly owned with sce  aps  salt river project  tucson and el paso and are operated by aps 
four corners and a portion of the facilities adjacent to sjgs are located on land held under easements from the united states and also under leases from the navajo nation 
the enforcement of these leases could require congressional consent 
the company does not deem the risk that is associated with the enforcement of these easements and leases to be material 
however  the company is dependent in some measure upon the willingness and ability of the navajo nation to protect these leased properties 
the company owns mw of generation capacity at reeves station in coa and mw of generation capacity at las vegas station in las vegas  new mexico 
during  the company added afton  a mw gas or oil fired combustion turbine plant in la mesa  new mexico  and lordsburg  an mw of gas fired combustion turbine generator in lordsburg  new mexico 
in addition  the company has mw of generation capacity in coa under an operating lease 
these power sources are used primarily for peaking and transmission support 
during times of excess capacity  resources have been used to augment the company s wholesale power trading activities 
nuclear plant the company s interest in pvngs the company is participating in the three  mw units of pvngs  also known as the arizona nuclear power project  with aps the operating agent  salt river project  el paso  sce  scppa and the department of water and power of the city of los angeles 
the company has a undivided interest in pvngs  with portions of its interests in units and held under leases 
nuclear safety performance rating on pvngs in  the nrc began using a new  objective oversight process that is more focused on safety 
the new process includes objective performance thresholds based on insights from safety studies and years of plant operating experience in the united states 
it is more timely to move from the to month time lag of the previous oversight process for assessing plant performance to a quarterly review 
the nrc also hopes the process will be more accessible to  and readily understood by  the public 
in its most recent review  pvngs had all indicators green the best possible of the four indicator levels 
sale and leaseback transactions of pvngs units and in and  the company entered into a total of eleven sale and lease back transactions with owner trusts under which it sold and leased back its entire interest in pvngs units and  together with portions of the company s undivided interest in certain pvngs common facilities 
the leases under each of the sale and leaseback transactions have initial lease terms expiring either on january  with respect to the unit leases or on january  with respect to the unit leases 
each of the leases allows the company to extend the term of the lease and includes a repurchase option 
the lease expense for the company s pvngs leases is approximately million per year 
throughout the terms of the leases  the company continues to have full and exclusive authority and responsibility to exercise and perform all of the rights and duties of a participant in pvngs under the arizona nuclear power project participation agreement and retains the exclusive right to sell and dispose of its share of the power and energy generated by pvngs units and the company also retains its responsibility to pay its share of all taxes  insurance premiums  operating and maintenance costs  costs related to capital improvements and decommissioning and all other similar costs and expenses associated with the leased facilities 
in  the company purchased approximately of the beneficial interests in the pvngs units and leases through the purchase of ownership interest in the trusts which held the leases 
the related ownership interests were subsequently reacquired by the company when the company s trust ownership was collapsed and the company assumed direct ownership 
in connection with the million retail rate reduction approved by the nmpuc in  the company wrote down the purchased beneficial interests in pvngs units and leases to million 
each lease describes certain events  events of loss or deemed loss events  the occurrence of which could require the company to  among other things  i pay the lessor and the equity investor  in return for the investor s interest in pvngs  cash in the amount provided in the lease and ii assume debt obligations relating to the pvngs lease 
the events of loss generally relate to casualties  accidents and other events at pvngs  which would severely  adversely affect the ability of the operating agent  aps  to operate  and the ability of the company to earn a return on its interests in  pvngs 
the deemed loss events consist mostly of legal and regulatory changes such as changes in law making the sale and leaseback transactions illegal  or changes in law making the lessors liable for nuclear decommissioning obligations 
the company believes that the probability of such events of loss or deemed loss events occurring is remote for the following reasons i to a large extent  prevention of events of loss and some deemed loss events is within the control of the pvngs participants  including the company  and the pvngs operating agent  through the general pvngs operational and safety oversight process and ii with respect to other deemed loss events  which would involve a significant change in current law and policy  the company is unaware of any pending proposals or proposals being considered for introduction in congress  or in any state legislative or regulatory body that  if adopted  would cause any of those events

item legal proceedings navajo nation environmental issues four corners is located on the navajo reservation and is held under an easement granted by the federal government as well as a lease from the navajo nation 
aps is the four corners operating agent and pnm owns a ownership interest in units and of four corners 
in july  the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act  the navajo nation safe drinking water act  and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively  the navajo acts 
the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality  drinking water  and pesticide activities  including those activities that occur at four corners 
on october   the four corners participants filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation  window rock district  challenging the applicability of the navajo nation as to four corners 
the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties  and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 
in february  the epa issued regulations identifying those clean air act provisions for which it is appropriate to treat native american tribes in the same manner as states 
the epa has announced that it has not yet determined whether the clean air act would supersede pre existing binding agreements between the navajo nation and the four corners participants that could limit the navajo nation s environmental regulatory authority over four corners 
the company believes that the clean air act does not supersede these pre existing agreements 
the company cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 
in april  the navajo tribal council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act 
the four corners participants believe that the regulations fail to recognize that the navajo nation did not intend to assert jurisdiction over four corners 
on july   each of the four corners participants filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of the operating permit regulations 
those proceedings have been stayed  pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above 
the company cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 
pvngs water supply litigation the company understands that a summons served on aps in required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed of arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january   in an action pending in the maricopa county superior court 
pvngs is located within the geographic area subject to the summons and the rights of the pvngs participants  including the company  to the use of groundwater and effluent at pvngs are potentially at issue in this action 
aps  as the pvngs project manager  filed claims that dispute the court s jurisdiction over the pvngs participants groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to pvngs and  alternatively  seek confirmation of those rights 
in november  the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes 
in addition  the arizona supreme court issued a decision in september affirming the lower court s criteria for resolving groundwater claims 
litigation on both these issues will continue in the trial court 
no trial date concerning the pvngs participants water rights claims has been set in this matter 
although this matter remains subject to further evaluation  the company expects that the described litigation will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position  results of operations or liquidity

recently  the navajo nation and various parties announced a preliminary settlement of the nation s reserved surface water rights 
discussions are still ongoing and congressional legislation as well as other approvals will be required to implement the settlement  if it is finalized 
the company cannot at this time anticipate the effect  if any  of any water rights adjudication on the present arrangements for water at sjgs and four corners

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent known 
overview the holding company is an investor owned holding company of energy and energy related companies 
its principal subsidiary  pnm  is an integrated public utility primarily engaged in the generation  transmission and distribution of electricity  transmission  distribution and sale of natural gas within the state of new mexico  and the sale and marketing of electricity in the western united states 
competitive strategy the company is positioned as a merchant utility  primarily operating as a regulated energy service provider 
the company is also engaged in the sale and marketing of electricity in the competitive energy marketplace 
as a utility  pnm has an obligation to serve its customers under the jurisdiction of the prc 
as a wholesale electricity provider  pnm markets excess production from the utility  as well as unregulated generation  into a competitive marketplace 
as part of its electric wholesale power operation  it purchases wholesale electricity in the open market for future resale or to provide energy to retail customers in new mexico when the company s generation assets cannot satisfy demand 
the wholesale operations utilize a net asset backed strategy  whereby the company s aggregate net open position for the sale of electricity is covered by the company s forecasted excess generation capabilities 
as it currently operates  the company s principal business segments  whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the company s management  are utility operations and wholesale operations wholesale 
utility operations include electric services electric  gas services gas and transmission services transmission 
these segments model the resource allocations as mandated in the global electric agreement see note commitments and contingencies global electric agreement in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
electric consists of the distribution and generation of electricity for retail electric customers in new mexico 
gas includes the transportation and distribution of natural gas to end users 
transmission consists of the transmission of electricity to third parties as well as to electric and wholesale 
wholesale consists of the generation and sale of electricity into the wholesale market based on three product lines  that include long term contracts  forward sales and short term sales 
the utility operations strategy is directed at supplying reasonably priced and reliable energy to retail customers through customer driven operational excellence  high quality customer service  cost efficient processes  and improved overall organizational performance 
the wholesale operations strategy calls for increased net asset backed energy sales supported by long term contracts and the wholesale market  whereby the company s aggregate net open forward electric sales position  including short term sales  forward sales and long term contracts  is covered by its forecasted excess generation capacity 
the net asset backed sales are actively monitored by management by the use of stringent risk management policies 
the company s future growth plans call for approximately of its new generation portfolio to be committed through long term contracts as required by the global electric agreement 
growth will be dependent on market development and on the company s ability to generate funds for the company s future expansion 
although the current economic environment has led the company to scale back its expansion plans  the company will continue to operate in the wholesale market and seek reasonably priced asset additions 
expansion of the company s generating portfolio will depend on the company s ability to acquire favorably priced assets at strategic locations and to secure long term commitments for the purchase of power from the acquired plants 
overall outlook earnings growth in was primarily due to the addition of new long term power contracts  coupled with customer growth in the company s utility operations and the company s ongoing cost control efforts 
the gains made in the company s wholesale operations more than offset a retail electric rate reduction that took effect in september and a reduction in gas utility revenues due to warmer weather in wholesale operations was the biggest contributor to the company s earnings growth in  aided by a more stable price environment 
the company continued to grow its wholesale sales by adding long term contracts to ensure a reliable and sustainable revenue source to support its wholesale operations 
in  the company added more than mw s of new long term contracts  of which contracts for mw s were added in late or do not commence until in addition  the company added mw of generating capacity in to support retail and enhance wholesale operations 
these developments allowed the company to improve its velocity  the company s ability to repurchase and remarket previously sold capacity 
the company s velocity ratio  which is defined as total electric wholesale and retail sales divided by total output of its generation plants  increased to in from in these gains were partially offset by extended scheduled outages and unplanned outages at sjgs and pvngs and the associated increases in purchase power costs 
retail operations also contributed to the company s earnings growth with increased load growth of in electric and in gas 
the company benefited from improved efficiencies and cost cutting measures  including lower power production costs 
on an operations and maintenance expense o m per revenue unit of sale basis  the company s o m costs decreased significantly from in to in the year was one of the warmest in recent new mexico history 
the warmer temperatures increased retail electric sales during the summer months but significantly reduced demand for natural gas during the colder months 
certain developments affecting the company  and which will have a more meaningful impact on its operating results in are as follows o on january   prc approved a million revenue increase for the company s gas utility 
increased rates for commercial customers took effect immediately  while the increase for residential customers will begin april  o on december   the company entered into an agreement to provide an arizona municipal utility with up to mw of power 
the ten year contract is expected to produce about million in revenues for the company in o in the fourth quarter of  the coal mine operations that supply sjgs reached commercial operation status 
in addition  the mine completed on schedule its first long wall mine change over to a new area of the coal seam 
coal costs in were significantly lower than in  and although coal costs cannot be predicted with certainty  the company currently estimates that coal costs will remain lower in than average levels 
in  the company intends to continue its efforts to expand its wholesale business by building on existing relationships and forming new relationships with long term contract customers 
the company expects its earnings to benefit from higher gas rates  forecasted lower fuel costs from the new sjgs underground mine and planned productivity improvements 
other factors that will be critical to achieving earnings goals in include continued stable wholesale market prices and improved plant performance 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated the company s net earnings for the year ended december  were million or per diluted share of common stock  a increase in net earnings compared to million or per diluted share of common stock in this increase primarily reflects the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the adoption of sfas of million  net of income taxes  and improved operating performance 
this increase was partially offset by the write off of transition costs of million  net of income taxes  that resulted from the repeal of electric deregulation in new mexico in the first quarter of and a write off of million  net of income taxes  for costs related to long term debt refinancing 
the following discussion is based on the methodology that the company s management uses for making operating decisions and assessing performance of its various business activities 
as such  these statements report operating results without regard to the effect of accounting or regulatory changes  and similar one time items not related to normal operations 
see note segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these results and the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  adjustments related to eitf issue issues related to accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities and reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement no 
and not held for trading purposes are excluded 
these accounting pronouncements require a net presentation of trading gains and losses and realized gains and loss for certain non trading derivatives 
management evaluates wholesale operations on a gross presentation basis due to its net asset backed marketing strategy and the importance it places on velocity 
corporate costs  income taxes and non operating items are discussed only on a consolidated basis and are in conformity with the presentation in the consolidated financial statements

the rate reduction resulted in a decrease in revenues of approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by average customer growth of approximately

the gross margin  or operating revenues minus cost of energy sold and intersegment energy transfer  decreased million or over the prior year period 
this decrease is due primarily to the rate decrease  an increase in cost of energy due to outages at palo verde nuclear generating station pvngs unit during the fourth quarter of for a steam generator replacement project  and the customer transfer described above of million 
these decreases were partially offset by customer growth and lower cost of generation 
total non fuel o m expenses decreased million or over the prior year period

operating revenues increased million or over the prior year period to million  primarily because of higher natural gas prices in as compared to pnm purchases natural gas in the open market and resells it at cost of purchase to its retail gas distribution customers 
as a result  increases or decreases in gas revenues driven by gas costs do not impact the company s consolidated gross margin or earnings 
the gross margin  or operating revenues minus cost of energy sold  decreased million or over the prior year period 
this decrease is due mainly to the expiration in january of a rate rider for the recovery of certain costs of million 
the price decrease was offset by an increase in volume 
transportation throughput increased by million decatherms  or driven by gas pipe line extensions  increasing off system sales 
despite customer growth of  volume from other customers decreased million decatherms  or caused by warmer weather in in january  the prc approved a cost of service gas rate increase  which will improve gas earnings by approximately million annually 
the company estimates that approximately two thirds of this increase will be realized in earnings due to a delay in implementing the residential increase until april total non fuel o m expenses decreased million or over the prior year period

this decrease in wholesale electricity sales primarily reflects the slowdown in the wholesale electric market  which resulted from steep declines in wholesale prices and market liquidity as compared to the prior year period 
the significantly higher wholesale pricing in was driven by increased demand in california  a lack of generating assets to serve the market and the impact of warm weather 
by contrast  saw relatively mild weather in the west  an abundance of low cost hydropower and weak economic conditions in the region 
as a result  the average price realized by the company fell to approximately per mwh in versus per mwh in the decline in merchant sales volumes reflect the reduction in market participants in the wholesale market caused by bankruptcy  reduced credit quality of firms in the market and firms exiting the wholesale market 
there are also significant unresolved legal  political and regulatory issues that had a dampening effect on activity in the marketplace 
as a result  the company s spot market and short term sales declined significantly in the company delivered wholesale bulk power of million mwh of electricity for the year ended december   compared to million mwh for the same period in the gross margin  or operating revenues minus cost of energy sold  decreased million or 
lower margins were created primarily by weak pricing  less price volatility and lower market liquidity 
in addition  unexpected outages at four corners reduced availability of power for wholesale sales 
these lower margins were partially offset by a favorable change in the mark to market position of the marketing portfolio of million year over year million gain in versus million loss in 
a majority of the gain in represents the reversal of previously recognized mark to market losses 
total non fuel o m increased million or 
energy production costs increased million or for the period due to costs of million related to the future expansion of afton 
this cost increase was partially offset by decreased costs of million for planned outages at sjgs 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million or for the period due to a higher depreciable plant base 
corporate and other corporate administrative and general costs  which represent costs that are driven primarily by corporate level activities  decreased million or for the period to million 
this decrease was due to lower bonus expense of million in resulting from lower earnings projections 
this decrease was partially offset by higher labor costs of million resulting from a transfer of employees from operations to corporate 
consolidating non operating other income and deductions other income decreased by million or reflecting lower year over year returns on investments reflecting market conditions

income taxes the company s consolidated income tax expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the impact of lower earnings and a decline in the effective tax rate 
the company s effective income tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate year over year was due to the reduction in earnings in without a corresponding reduction in permanent tax benefits and the recognition of certain affordable housing and research and development credits in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to select and apply accounting policies that best provide the framework to report the company s results of operations and financial position 
the selection and application of those policies require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments concerning reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
the judgments and uncertainties inherent in this process affect the application of those policies 
as a result  there exists the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
management has identified the following accounting policies that it deems critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that involve significant subjectivity 
management believes that its selection and application of these policies best represent the operating results and financial position of the company 
the following discussion provides information on the processes utilized by management in making judgments and assumptions as they apply to its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition operating revenues are recorded as services are rendered to customers 
the company s utility operations records unbilled revenues representing the estimated amount customers will be billed for services rendered between the meter reading dates in a particular month and the end of that month 
the unbilled revenues estimate is reversed in the following month 
to the extent the estimated amount differs from the amount subsequently billed  revenues will be affected 
at december  and  unbilled revenues in the consolidated balance sheet included estimates of million and million  respectively  from the company s utility operations 
regulatory assets and liabilities the company is subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 

accordingly  the company has recorded assets and liabilities on its balance sheet resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process  which would not be recorded under gaap for non regulated entities 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers 
the company s continued ability to meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
may be affected in the future by competitive forces and restructuring in the electric industry 
in the event that sfas no 
no longer applied to all  or a separable portion  of company s operations  the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism is provided 
substantially all of the company s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are reflected in rates charged to retail customers or have been addressed in a regulatory proceeding 
to the extent that the company concludes that the recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable due to regulatory treatment  the effects of competition or other factors  the amount would be recorded as a charge to earnings as recovery is no longer probable 
the company regularly assesses whether its regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes  recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction  anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact  developments in the ratemaking process and the ability to recover costs 
as the company s electric rates are fixed  the opportunity to recover increased costs and the costs of new investment in facilities through rates during the five year rate freeze period is also limited 
as a result  the company defers certain costs based on its expectation that it will recover these costs in future rate cases 
if future recovery of these costs ceases to be probable  the company would be required to record a charge in current period earnings for the portion of the costs that were not recoverable 
asset impairment the company evaluates its tangible long lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
these potential impairment triggers would include fluctuating market conditions as a result of industry deregulation  planned and scheduled customer purchase commitments  future market penetration  fluctuating market prices resulting from changing fuel costs  other economic conditions  etc  weather patterns  and other market trends 
accounting rules require that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a company s asset without interest charges that will be recognized as expenses when incurred  is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company determined that no triggering events occurred during the period in regards to its generation assets 
at december   the company analyzed three turbines  which are currently in storage  with a combined carrying value of approximately million 
these assets were intended for planned build outs that have been delayed or canceled 
based on the company s various plans to make these turbines operational  the company concluded that it will fully recover its investment 
the company expects to begin construction utilizing these assets over the next several years 
if the company were unable to realize these plans  the company would be forced to recognize a loss with respect to the carrying value of these assets depending on prevailing market conditions 
the company will continue to analyze the turbines for impairment in accordance with sfas pension plan the company and its subsidiaries maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan pension plan  which covers eligible non union and union employees including officers 
the pension plan was frozen at the end of with regard to new participants  salary levels and benefits 
the company s policy is to fund actuarially determined contributions 
the company s expense for its pension plan approximated million for the year ended december   and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on the pension plan assets of 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption  the company evaluated input from its actuaries and its investment consultant  including their review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
this long term rate of return assumption compares to the historical year compounded return of through the end of december the expected long term rate of return on the pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of with equity managers  with fixed income managers  and with alternative investments that are primarily real estate  private equity  and absolute return strategies 
the pension plan s actual asset allocation as of december  was with equity managers  with fixed income managers  and with alternative investments 
the company reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the asset allocation to the targeted allocation 
the company continues to believe that is a reasonable long term rate of return on the pension plan s assets  despite the recent market upturn in which the pension plan assets had a gain of for the twelve months ended december  the company will continue to evaluate its actuarial assumptions  including expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust as necessary 
the company bases its determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
if investment return is outside a range of to expected long term rate of return plus or minus  this market related valuation recognizes the portion of return that is outside the range over a five year period from the year in which the return occurs 
since the market related value of assets recognizes the portion of return that is outside the range over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred returns are recorded 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of long term high grade bonds and management s expectation 
as a result of this review  the company adjusted the rate to at december  from at september  based on an expected rate of return on the pension plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions  it is estimated that the pension income for the pension plan will approximate million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year future actual pension income or expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the company s pension plans 
lowering the pension plan s expected long term rate of return on pension assets by from to would have raised pension expense for fiscal year by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate by would have increased pension expense for fiscal year by approximately million 
the value of the pension plan assets has increased from million at december  to million at december  including million of contributions during the company does not expect to make any contributions for the plan year 
self insurance the company self insures for certain losses related to general liability  workers compensation and automobile claims 
the company maintains insurance with third party insurers in excess of the company s self insured retentions to limit the company s exposure per occurrence or accident  as applicable 
the company s self insurance liabilities reflect the estimated ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon claims filed  estimated claims incurred but not reported  and analyses of industry and historical data 
beginning january   the company began to self insure certain health care costs of its employees 
the company self insures for certain medical and dental benefits for active employees and retirees under the benefit programs 
the company maintains stop loss insurance with third party insurers in excess of the company s self insured retentions to limit the company s exposure per participant  as applicable 
management reviews the amounts recorded for these liabilities on a quarterly basis to ensure that they are appropriate 
while management believes that these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  the company s financial results could be impacted if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims or fluctuations in premiums  differ from the company s estimates 
contingent liabilities there are various claims and lawsuits pending against the company and certain of its subsidiaries 
the company has recorded a liability when the effect of litigation can be estimated and where an outcome is considered probable 
management s estimates are based on its knowledge of the relevant facts at the time of the issuance of the company s consolidated financial statements 
subsequent developments could materially alter management s assessment of a matter s probable outcome and the estimate of liability 
environmental issues the company records its environmental liabilities when site assessments or remedial actions are probable and a range of reasonably likely cleanup costs can be estimated 
the company reviews its sites and measures the liability quarterly  by assessing a range of reasonably likely costs for each identified site using currently available information  including existing technology  current laws and regulations  experience gained at similar sites  and the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties 
these estimates include costs for site investigations  remediation  operations and maintenance  monitoring and site closure 
unless there is a probable amount  the company records the lower end of this reasonably likely range of costs classified as other long term liabilities at undiscounted amounts 
subsequent developments could materially alter management s assessment of a matter s probable outcome and the estimate of liability

see also financing activities below for additional discussion regarding the company s accounting policies for forward interest swaps 
effects of certain events on future revenues the company s long term contracts to supply power expire from through the ability of the company to renew these contracts at terms comparable to those currently in place is dependent upon prevailing market conditions at the time of negotiations 
currently  the company has a long term firm commitment contract of mw set to expire in the contract is priced significantly above current market prices  however  the company believes that it will be able to significantly mitigate any revenue loss due to a rising forward market 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and short term investments of million compared to million in cash and short term investments at december  cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in cash flows was due to increased profitability in the company s wholesale power operations  higher gas sales volumes and lower tax payments 
also contributing to the increase were payments in which did not recur in the company did not make its first quarter estimated federal income tax payment of million until january because of an extension granted by the irs to taxpayers in several counties in new mexico as a result of wildfires in in addition  the company made payments in of million for the termination of the surface coal contract and million to secure a long term wholesale contract 
this increase in operating cash flows was offset by higher wholesale electric prices and volume and higher gas prices in the current year 
the company s gas working capital is negatively affected by the timing difference in gas purchases and collections 
the company pays for gas in the month following purchase 
recovery of gas costs has typically taken up to three months 
the negative effect of this mismatch in cash flows was greater in due to the increase in gas prices 
the increase in accounts receivable also reflects higher wholesale electric prices in in addition  electric retail collections decreased due to the rate reduction 
cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in cash used in for investing activities included construction expenditures for new generating plants of million 
payments for combustion turbines were million in compared to million in cash used for investing activities in also included the purchase of certain long term debt underlying leased assets in the open market for million see liquidity below 
the cash used for investing activities in was largely offset by the redemption of short term investments of million in at the holding company level as compared to million in at pnm 
these redemptions were primarily used for the company s retirement of the eip long term debt underlying the lease assets  repayment of short term debt  debt refinancing and pension funding 
cash used for financing activities was million in compared to cash generated by financing activities of million in financing activities in primarily consisted of the retirement of long term debt of million  costs associated with the refunding and refinancing of long term debt of million and short term debt repayments of million 
in  the company had short term borrowings of million for short term liquidity needs 
pension and other post retirement benefits in may  the board of directors approved the use of holding company stock in the funding of the company s pension plan as well as its retiree medical trust 
corporate plan sponsors may make contributions of common stock to their defined benefit plans of up to of the value of the portfolio without department of labor dol approval  provided that the contribution does not otherwise constitute a prohibited transaction under the employee retirement income security act erisa 
in june  a contribution of  shares of holding company common stock approximately million in market value was made to the company s pension plan 
the shares of holding company common stock were sold over a period of time and there were no shares of common stock remaining in the defined benefit trust on december  due to the appreciation in stock value  the net proceeds realized by the pension plan from the sale of holding company common stock was million 
capital requirements total capital requirements include construction expenditures as well as other major capital requirements and cash dividend requirements for both common and preferred stock 
the main focus of the company s current construction program is upgrading generation systems  upgrading and expanding the electric and gas transmission and distribution systems and purchasing nuclear fuel 
to preserve a strong financial position  the company announced in its plans to delay capital expenditures for previously planned generation expansion 
projections for total capital requirements for are million and projections for construction expenditures for are million 
total capital requirements are projected to be million and construction expenditures are projected to be million for these estimates are under continuing review and subject to on going adjustment 
this projection excludes any generation fleet expansion capital  including any plans for the utilization of the turbines in storage 
the company continues to look for appropriately priced generation acquisition and expansion opportunities to support retail electric load growth  the continued expansion of its long term contract business and to supplement its natural transmission position in the southwest and west 
in the year ended december   the company utilized cash generated from operations and cash on hand  as well as its liquidity arrangements  to cover its capital requirements and construction expenditures 
the company anticipates that internal cash generation and current debt capacity will be sufficient to meet all of its capital requirements and construction expenditures for the years through to cover the difference in the amounts and timing of cash generation and cash requirements  the company intends to use short term borrowings under its current and future liquidity arrangements 
liquidity as of march   pnm had million of liquidity arrangements 
the liquidity arrangements consist of million from an unsecured revolving credit facility credit facility  million from an accounts receivable securitization program ar securitization and million in local lines of credit 
pnm entered into a new revolving credit facility on november   which increased borrowing capacity from million to million 
this facility will mature november  as of march   there were no borrowings against the credit facility  pnm was using million of the ar securitization capacity and no borrowings under its local lines of credit 
pnm had million of commercial paper outstanding as of march  in addition  the holding company has million in local lines of credit with no usage at december  or march  on april   the company entered into the ar securitization providing for the securitization of pnm s retail electric service accounts receivable and retail gas services accounts receivable 
the total capacity under the ar securitization is million 
under the ar securitization  pnm will periodically sell its accounts receivable  principally retail receivables  to a bankruptcy remote subsidiary  pnm receivables corp  which in turn pledges an undivided interest in the receivables to an unaffiliated conduit commercial paper issuer 
on april   pnm exercised its early buyout option related to a interest in the eip transmission line and related facilities held under lease 
through the exercise of the early buyout option  pnm was able to retire all million of secured facility bonds  which were issued to originally finance the sale leaseback transaction 
the secured facility bonds had previously been disclosed as off balance sheet lease obligations in the notes to the company s financial statements 
the company will continue to exclude approximately million of lease obligations relating to the interest the company does not own from the consolidated balance sheet 
on june   the holding company and pnm each filed universal shelf registration statements with the sec for a combination of debt and equity securities for million and million  respectively 
the pnm shelf registration statement when combined with a previously filed shelf registration statement  provides million of capacity 
the pnm and holding company shelf registration statements were declared effective june  and august   respectively

on august   the company entered into an unrated private issuance commercial paper program 
the company will periodically issue up to million in unrated commercial paper for the shorter of days or the maturity of the company s credit facility 
the commercial paper is unsecured and the proceeds will be used to reduce revolving credit borrowings 
the company s credit facility serves as a backstop for the outstanding commercial paper 
the company s ability to access the capital markets  if required  at a reasonable cost and to provide for other capital needs is largely dependent upon its ability to earn a fair return on equity  its results of operations  its credit ratings  obtaining required regulatory approvals and financial and wholesale market conditions 
financing flexibility is enhanced by providing a high percentage of total capital requirements from internal sources and having the ability  if necessary  to issue long term securities and to obtain short term credit

investors are cautioned that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities  that it is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of operating lease obligations for pvngs units and  eip and the delta operating lease 
the total capitalization in relation to these obligations was million as of december  and million as of december  see commitments and contractual obligations below 
commitments and contractual obligations the following tables show the company s long term obligations and commitments as of december  payments due in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years short term debt a   long term debt    operating leases      purchased power agreements      coal contract b      total contractual cash obligations      a represents the actual outstanding balance of the various credit facilities as of december  b assumes normal deliveries under the coal contract 
if no deliveries are made  certain minimum payments may be required under the coal contract 
amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands total other commercial amounts after commitments committed year years years years short term debt c   local lines of credit   letters of credit   total commercial commitments    c represents the unused borrowing capacity of the various credit facilities less outstanding letters of credit of million as of december  pnm leases interests in units and of pvngs  certain transmission facilities  office buildings and other equipment under operating leases 
the lease expense for pvngs is million per year over base lease terms expiring in and in  pnm established pvngs capital trust capital trust for the purpose of acquiring all the debt underlying the pvngs leases 
pnm consolidates capital trust in its consolidated financial statements 
the purchase was funded with the proceeds from the issuance of million of suns  which were loaned to capital trust 
capital trust then acquired and now holds the debt component of the pvngs leases 
for legal and regulatory reasons  the pvngs lease payment continues to be recorded and paid gross with the debt component of the payment returned to pnm through capital trust 
as a result  the net cash outflows for the pvngs lease payment were million for the year ended december  the table above reflects the net lease payment 
pnm s other significant operating lease obligations include the eip  a leased interest in transmission line with annual lease payments of million see financing activities below  and an operating lease for the entire output of delta  a gas fired generating plant in albuquerque  new mexico  with imputed annual lease payments of million 
the company s off balance sheet obligations are limited to pnm s operating leases and certain financial instruments related to the purchase and sale of energy see below 
the present value of pnm s operating lease obligations for pvngs units and  eip and the delta operating lease was million as of december  pnm has entered into various long term power purchase agreements ppas obligating it to buy electricity for aggregate fixed payments of million plus the cost of production and a return 
these contracts expire december through december in addition  pnm is obligated to sell electricity for million in fixed payments plus the cost of production and a return 
these contracts expire through may pnm s marketing portfolio as of december  included open forward contract positions to buy million of electricity and to sell million of electricity 
in addition  pnm had open forward contract positions classified as normal sales of electricity under the derivative accounting rules of million and normal purchases of electricity of million 
pnm contracts for the purchase of gas to serve its retail customers 
these contracts are short term in nature  supplying the gas needs for the current heating season and the following off season months 
the price of gas is a pass through  whereby pnm recovers of its cost of gas 
contingent provisions of certain obligations the holding company and pnm have a number of debt obligations and other contractual commitments that contain contingent provisions 
some of these  if triggered  could affect the liquidity of the company 
the holding company or pnm could be required to provide security  immediately pay outstanding obligations or be prevented from drawing on unused capacity under certain credit agreements if the contingent requirements were to be triggered 
the most significant consequences resulting from these contingent requirements are detailed in the discussion below 
pnm s master purchase agreement for the procurement of gas for its retail customers contains a contingent requirement that could require pnm to provide security for its gas purchase obligations if the seller were to reasonably believe that pnm was unable to fulfill its payment obligations under the agreement 
the master agreement for the sale of electricity in the western systems power pool wspp contains a contingent requirement that could require pnm to provide security if its debt were to fall below investment grade rating 
the wspp agreement also contains a contingent requirement  commonly called a material adverse change mac provision  which could require pnm to provide security if a material adverse change in its financial condition or operations were to occur 
pnm s committed credit facility contains a ratings trigger  for pricing purposes only 
if pnm is downgraded or upgraded by the ratings agencies  the result would be an increase or decrease in interest cost  respectively 
pnm s committed credit facility contains a mac provision which  if triggered  could prevent pnm from drawing on its unused capacity under the credit facility 
in addition  the credit facility contains a contingent requirement that requires pnm to maintain a debt to capital ratio  inclusive of off balance sheet debt  of less than as well as maintenance of an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda interest coverage ratio of three times 
if pnm s debt to capital ratio  inclusive of off balance sheet debt  were to exceed or its interest coverage ratio falls below  pnm could be required to repay all borrowings under the credit facility  be prevented from drawing on the unused capacity under the credit facility  and be required to provide security for all outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
if a contingent requirement were to be triggered under the credit facility resulting in an acceleration of the outstanding loans under the credit facility  a cross default provision in the pvngs leases could occur if the accelerated amount is not paid 
if a cross default provision is triggered  the lessors have the ability to accelerate their rights under the leases  including acceleration of all future lease payments 
financing activities pursuant to prc approval  on september   pnm issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of its senior unsecured notes with a interest rate that mature september  the transaction closed on september  and the proceeds were used to retire million of long term debt that would otherwise have matured in august  pay the transaction costs  and improve working capital 
all other long term debt of pnm matures in or later 
the premium paid to refinance the long term debt was million of which million was charged against earnings based on prior regulatory agreements 
the remaining balance was capitalized as loss on reacquired debt and will be amortized over the life of the new debt 
on may   the company priced million of tax exempt pollution control bonds 
the bonds were priced at an initial interest rate of 
the bond sale closed on may  by april   million of bonds will need to be remarketed and million of bonds will need to be remarketed by july  a portion of the proceeds were used to redeem the million of pollution control bonds  which became callable on december  the remaining million was used to redeem million of pollution control bonds in august the company had previously entered into various forward swaps in and  to hedge the interest rate on the refinancing see note fair value of financial instruments forward starting interest rate swaps in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company could enter into other long term financings or hedging transactions for the purpose of strengthening its balance sheet  funding growth and reducing its cost of capital 
the company continues to evaluate its investment and debt retirement options to optimize its financing strategy and earnings potential 
no additional first mortgage bonds may be issued under pnm s mortgage 
the amount of suns that may be issued is not limited by the suns indenture 
however  debt to capital requirements in certain of pnm s financial instruments and regulatory agreements would ultimately limit the amount of additional debt pnm would issue 
dividends the holding company s board of directors regularly reviews the dividend policy 
the declaration of common dividends is dependent upon a number of factors including the ability of the holding company s subsidiaries to pay dividends 
currently  pnm is the holding company s primary source of dividends 
as part of the order approving the formation of the holding company  the prc placed certain restrictions on the ability of pnm to pay dividends to the holding company 
pnm cannot pay dividends that will cause its debt rating to go below investment grade 
pnm also cannot pay dividends in any year  as determined on a rolling four quarter basis  in excess of net earnings for that year without prior prc approval 
pnm has dividended all eligible amounts under the pre agreement to its parent 
in january  with the signing of the global electric agreement  the prc modified the pnm dividend restriction to allow pnm to dividend earnings as well as equity contributions made by the holding company back to the holding company 
additionally  pnm has various financial covenants  which limit the transfer of assets  whether through dividends or other means 
in addition  the ability of the holding company to declare dividends is dependent upon the extent to which cash flows will support dividends  the availability of earnings  its financial circumstances and performance  the effect of regulatory decisions and legislative activities  future growth plans  the related capital requirements  standard business considerations and market and economic conditions generally 
consistent with the prc s holding company order  pnm paid dividends of million to the holding company for the year ended december  on february   the holding company s board of directors approved a increase in the common stock dividend 
the increase raised the quarterly dividend to per share  for an indicated annual dividend of per share 
capital structure the company s capitalization  including current maturities of long term debt  is shown below december  common equity preferred stock long term debt total capitalization total capitalization does not include as debt the present value of pnm s operating lease obligations for pvngs units and  eip and the delta operating lease which was million as of december  and million as of december  other issues facing the company see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage risk as it relates to changes in natural gas and electric prices  changes in interest rates and  historically  adverse market changes for investments held by the company s various trusts 
additionally  the company uses derivative instruments based on certain financial composite indices as part of its enhanced cash management program 
the company also uses certain derivative instruments for wholesale power marketing transactions in order to take advantage of favorable price movements and market timing activities in the wholesale power markets 
the following additional information is provided 
risk management the company controls the scope of its various forms of risk through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures and oversight by senior level management and the holding company board of directors 
the board s finance committee sets the risk limit parameters 
the risk management committee rmc  comprised of corporate and business segment officers and other managers  oversees all of the activities  which include commodity price  credit  equity  interest rate and business risks 
the rmc has oversight for the ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the risk control organization and policies 
the company has a risk control organization  headed by the director of financial risk management risk manager  which is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies  procedures and limits and evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions  on an enterprise wide basis 
the rmc s responsibilities specifically include establishment of a general policy regarding risk exposure levels and activities in each of the business segments  recommendation of the types of instruments permitted  authority to establish a general policy regarding counterparty exposure and limits  authorization and delegation of transaction limits  review and approval of controls and procedures  review and approval of models and assumptions used to calculate mark to market and risk exposure  authority to approve and open brokerage and counterparty accounts  review of hedging and risk activities  and quarterly reporting to the finance committee and the board of directors on these activities 
the rmc also proposes value at risk var limits to the finance committee 
the finance committee ultimately sets the aggregate var limits 
it is the responsibility of each business segment to create its own control procedures and policies within the parameters established by the finance committee 
the rmc reviews and approves these policies  which are created with the assistance of the corporate controller  director of internal audit and the risk manager 
each business segment s policies address the following controls authorized risk exposure limits  authorized instruments and markets  authorized personnel  policies on segregation of duties  policies on mark to market accounting  responsibilities for deal capture  confirmation procedures  responsibilities for reporting results  statement on the role of derivative transactions  and limits on individual transaction size nominal value 
to the extent an open position exists  fluctuating commodity prices can impact financial results and financial position  either favorably or unfavorably 
as a result  the company cannot predict with certainty the impact that its risk management decisions may have on its businesses  operating results or financial position 
commodity risk marketing and procurement of energy often involves market risks associated with managing energy commodities and establishing open positions in the energy markets  primarily on a short term basis 
these risks fall into three different categories price and volume volatility  credit risk of counterparties and adequacy of the control environment 
pnm routinely enters into forward contracts and options to hedge purchase and sale commitments  fuel requirements and to enhance returns and minimize the risk of market fluctuations on the wholesale operations 
the company s wholesale operations  including long term contracts  forward sales and short term sales  are managed through a net asset backed marketing strategy  whereby pnm s aggregate net open forward contract position is covered by its forecasted excess generation capabilities 
pnm is exposed to market risk if its generation capabilities were disrupted or if its retail load requirements were greater than anticipated 
if pnm were required to cover all or a portion of its net open contract position  it would have to meet its commitments through market purchases 
under the derivative accounting rules and the related accounting rules for energy contracts  the company accounts for its various financial derivative instruments for the purchase and sale of energy differently based on management s intent when entering into the contract 
energy contracts which meet the definition of a derivative under sfas and do not qualify for a normal purchase or sale designation are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value at each period end 
the changes in fair market value are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
should an energy transaction qualify as a hedge under sfas  fair market value changes from year to year are recognized on the balance sheet with a corresponding charge to other comprehensive income 
gains or losses are recognized when the hedged transaction settles 
derivatives that meet the normal sales and purchases exceptions within sfas as amended  are not marked to market but rather recorded in results of operations when the underlying transaction settles 
intentionally left blank the following table shows the net fair value of mark to market energy contracts included in the balance sheet december  in thousands mark to market energy contracts current asset   long term asset  total mark to market assets   current liability   long term liability  total mark to market liabilities   net fair value of mark to market energy contracts the mark to market energy portfolio positions represent net assets at december  and represent net liabilities at december  after netting all applicable open purchase and sale contracts 
the market prices used to value pnm s mark to market energy portfolio are based on closing exchange prices and broker quotations 
as of december  and december   pnm did not have any outstanding contracts that were valued using methods other than quoted prices 
the company did not change its methods for valuing its mark to market energy portfolio in as compared to the following table provides detail of changes in the company s mark to market energy portfolio net asset or liability balance sheet position from one period to the next twelve months ended december  in thousands sources of fair value gain loss fair value at beginning of year  amount realized on contracts delivered during period   changes in fair value   net fair value at end of period net change recorded as mark to market   the following table provides the maturity of the net assets liabilities of the company  giving an indication of when these mark to market amounts will settle and generate use cash 
the following values were determined using broker quotes fair value at december  maturities less than year years total in thousands as of december   a decrease in market pricing of pnm s mark to market energy portfolio by would have resulted in a decrease in net earnings of less than 
conversely  an increase in market pricing of this portfolio by would have resulted in an increase in net earnings of less than the company assesses the risk of these long term contracts and wholesale sales activities using the var method to maintain the company s total exposure within management prescribed limits 
the company utilizes the variance covariance model of var  which is a probabilistic model that measures the risk of loss to earnings in market sensitive instruments 
the variance covariance model relies on statistical relationships to analyze how changes in different markets can affect a portfolio of instruments with different characteristics and market exposure 
var models are relatively sophisticated 
the quantitative risk information  however  is limited by the parameters established in creating the model 
the instruments being evaluated may trigger a potential loss in excess of calculated amounts if changes in commodity prices exceed the confidence level of the model used 
the var methodology employs the following critical parameters volatility estimates  market values of open positions  appropriate market oriented holding periods and seasonally adjusted correlation estimates 
the company s portfolio var calculation considers the company s forward position for the preceding eighteen months 
the mark to market var is calculated through the contract periods 
the company uses a holding period of three days as the estimate of the length of time that will be needed to liquidate the positions 
the volatility and the correlation estimates measure the impact of adverse price movements both at an individual position level as well as at the total portfolio level 
the two tailed confidence level established is 
for example  if var is calculated at million  it is estimated at a confidence level that if prices move against pnm s positions  the company s pre tax gain or loss in liquidating the portfolio would not exceed million in the three days that it would take to liquidate the portfolio 
the company s var is regularly monitored by the company s rmc 
the rmc has put in place procedures to ensure that increases in var are reviewed and  if deemed necessary  acted upon to reduce exposures 
the var represents an estimate of the potential gains or losses that could be recognized on pnm s wholesale power marketing portfolios given current volatility in the market  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  as well as changes to pnm s wholesale power marketing portfolios during the year 
the company accounts for the sale of electric generation in excess of its retail needs or the purchase of power for retail needs as normal purchases and sales under sfas transactions that do not meet the normal purchase or sale exception or the definition of a hedge under sfas are accounted for as energy marketing contracts and comprise pnm s mark to market portfolio 
the var for the mark to market portfolio was thousand at december  the company also calculates a portfolio var for the preceding months  which in addition to its mark to market portfolio includes all contracts designated as normal sales and purchases  hedges  and its estimated excess generation assets 
this excess is determined using average peak forecasts for the respective block of power in the forward market 
the company s portfolio var was million at december  the following table shows the high  average and low market risk as measured by var on the company s mark to market portfolio twelve months ended december  period high average low end in thousands three day holding period  two tailed confidence level one day holding period  two tailed confidence level ten day holding period  two tailed confidence level  credit risk pnm is exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment by counterparties 
the company uses a credit management process to assess and monitor the financial conditions of counterparties 
credit exposure is also regularly monitored by the rmc 
the company provides for losses due to market and credit risk 
pnm s credit risk with its largest counterparty as of december  was million 
the following table provides information related to pnm s credit exposure as of december  the company does not hold any credit collateral as of december  the table further delineates that exposure by the credit worthiness credit rating of the counterparties and provides guidance as to the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties pnm may have 
also provided is an indication of the maturity of a company s credit risk by credit ratings of the counterparties

the internal ratings investment grade includes those counterparties that are internally rated as investment grade in accordance with the guidelines established in the company s credit policy 
b the net credit risk exposure is the net credit exposure to pnm from its wholesale operations 
this includes long term contracts  forward sales and short term sales 
the exposure captures the net amounts due to pnm from receivables payables for realized transactions  delivered and unbilled revenues  and mark to market gains losses pursuant to contract terms 
exposures are offset according to legally binding netting arrangements and reduced by credit collateral 
credit collateral includes cash deposits  letters of credit and performance bonds received from counterparties

the financial impact of all hedge gains and losses  including the related costs of the program  is recoverable through the purchased gas adjustment clause 
as a result  earnings are not affected by gains and losses generated by these instruments 
interest rate risk as of december  the company had liquidated its investment portfolio of fixed rate government obligations and corporate securities 
pnm has long term debt which subjects it to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
the majority of the company s long term debt is fixed rate debt  and therefore  does not expose the company s earnings to a major risk of loss due to adverse changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of all long term debt instruments would increase by approximately or million if interest rates were to decline by basis points from their levels at december  as of december   the fair value of pnm s long term debt was  million as compared to a book value of million 
in general  an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows if pnm were to re acquire all or a portion of its debt instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
during the twelve months ended december   pnm contributed cash of million and approximately million in holding company common shares for plan year and to the trust for the company s pension plan 
in addition  the company contributed cash of approximately million to other post retirement benefits for plan year the securities held by the trusts had an estimated fair value of million as of december   of which approximately were fixed rate debt securities that subject the company to risk of loss of fair value with movements in market interest rates 
if rates were to increase by basis points from their levels at december   the decrease in the fair value of the securities would be or million 
pnm does not currently recover or return through rates any losses or gains on these securities 
the company  therefore  is at risk for shortfalls in its funding of its obligations due to investment losses 
the company does not believe that long term market returns over the period of funding will be less than required for the company to meet its obligations 
however  this belief is based on assumptions about future returns that are inherently uncertain 
equity market risk pnm contributes to trusts established to fund its share of the decommissioning costs of pvngs and pension and other post retirement benefits 
the trusts hold certain equity securities as of december  these equity securities also expose the company to losses in fair value 
approximately of the securities held by the various trusts were equity securities as of december  the company is currently implementing a change in the asset allocation in the pension portfolio  which will reduce the domestic equity exposure from to 
similar to the debt securities held for funding decommissioning and certain pension and other post retirement costs  pnm does not recover or earn a return through rates on any losses or gains on these equity securities 
in  the company implemented an enhanced cash management strategy using derivative instruments based on the s p  s p  and nasdaq composite indices 
the strategy is designed to capitalize on high market volatility or benefit from market direction 
an investment manager is utilized to execute the program 
the risk related to the program is carefully managed by the rmc and has var and stop loss limits established 
trades are typically closed out before the end of a reporting period and within the same day of execution 
in january  the company terminated the use of this derivative trading strategy for the enhanced cash management program
