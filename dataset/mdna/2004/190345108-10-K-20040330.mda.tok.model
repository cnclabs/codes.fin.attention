item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and use of estimates general in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record most of our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in determining the fair value of some of our assets  principally accounts receivable  inventories and deferred income taxes  we must make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding future events and circumstances that could affect the value of those assets  such as future economic conditions that will affect our ability to collect our accounts receivable or sell our inventories 
those judgments  estimates and assumptions are based on current information available to us at the time they are made 
many of those events and circumstances  however  are outside of our control and if changes in those events or circumstances subsequently occur  gaap will require us to adjust the earlier estimates that are affected by those changes 
any resulting downward adjustments to our prior estimates of fair value are commonly referred to as write downs of assets involved 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances against which we are able to charge any such downward adjustments or write downs in fair value of such assets 
examples include reserves or allowances established for uncollectible accounts receivable sometimes referred to as bad debt reserves and reserves for inventory obsolescence 
the amounts at which those reserves are established and maintained are based on historical experience and also on our assumptions and judgments about future circumstances  business trends and market and economic conditions 
those reserves are periodically increased to replenish the reserve following write downs of uncollectible accounts or to take account of increased risks due to changes in circumstances  business trends or economic conditions 
those increases are effectuated by charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those reserves or allowances are increased 
as a result  our judgments  estimates and assumptions about future events can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record these assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
under gaap  most businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which sales are recorded and also the amounts at which they are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on such factors as the steps or actions that a business must take to complete a sale of products to or to perform services for a customer and the circumstances under which a customer would be entitled to return the products or reject or adjust the payment for the services rendered to it 
additionally  in the case of a company that grants its customers contractual rights to return products sold to them  gaap requires that the company establish a reserve or allowance for product returns by means of a reduction in the amount at which its sales are recorded primarily based on the nature  extensiveness and duration of those rights and its historical return experience 
in making our estimates and assumptions we follow gaap and accounting practices applicable to our business that we believe will enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the fair value of those assets and to establish adequate reserves or allowances 
see consolidated financial statements report of independent certified public accountants in item of this report 
critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations that are discussed below 
revenue recognition and the allowance for product returns 
we recognize revenue from the sale of a product upon its shipment to the customer 
we provide our customers with limited rights of return 
we establish an allowance for potential returns that reduces the amounts of our reported sales 
we estimate the allowance based on historical experience with returns of like products and current economic and market conditions  which can affect the level at which customers submit product returns 

table of contents accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our business we extend day payment terms to our customers and  due to the seasonality of our business  during late fall and winter we grant extended payment terms to those of our customers that have good credit records 
we regularly review our customers accounts and estimate the amount of and establish an allowance for uncollectible amounts or receivables in each reporting period 
the amount of the allowance is based on several factors  including the age of unpaid amounts  a review of significant past due accounts  and current economic trends and trends in our markets  which affect the ability of customers to keep their accounts current 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed periodically to determine if the allowance should be increased  and any increases are recorded in the accounting period in which the events that require such increases become known 
for example  if the financial condition of customers or economic or market conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting the ability of customers to make payments  increases in the allowance may be required 
since the allowance is created by recording a charge which is included in  and therefore has the effect of increasing  selling  general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will reduce income in the period when the increase is recorded 
reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or net realizable value and are reduced by an allowance for excess and slowing moving or obsolete inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined on the basis of historical experience with different product lines  estimates concerning future economic and market conditions and estimates of future sales 
if there is an economic downturn or a decline in sales  causing inventories of some product lines to accumulate  it may become necessary to increase the allowance 
other factors that can require increases in the allowance or inventory write downs are reductions in pricing or introduction of new or competitive products by manufacturers  however  due to the relative maturity of the markets in which the company operates  usually these are not significant factors 
increases in this allowance also will cause a decline in operating results as such increases are effectuated by charges against income 
allowance for deferred income taxes 
we record as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet tax loss and tax credit carryforwards and tax deductions that can be applied in future periods to offset or reduce our future income tax liability 
at december  the aggregate amount of that deferred tax asset was approximately million 
under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations  tax loss and tax credit carryforwards and tax deductions will expire if not used within specified periods of time 
accordingly  the ability to use this deferred tax asset depends on our generating taxable income during those time periods 
under gaap the amount that we are permitted to record  as a deferred tax asset  is the amount of available tax loss and tax credit carryforwards that we believe we will be able to utilize prior to their expiration based on an estimate of our future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  we consider current operating and economic and market trends as they may affect the amounts and timing of future taxable income that we currently believe we can generate during the periods remaining prior to the expiration of the tax loss and tax credit carryforwards that are available to offset future income tax liability 
if that estimate indicates that it we are not likely to be able to fully utilize the available tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  we would establish a valuation allowance that would be applied as a reduction of the gross amount of that deferred tax asset 
currently available evidence leads us to believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the net deferred tax asset that is recorded in our financial statements 
however  if due to future events or circumstances  such as an economic downturn that might adversely affect our operating results  we subsequently come to a different conclusion regarding our future taxable income and  hence  our ability to fully utilize this asset  we would increase the allowance and thereby reduce the amount at which we record the deferred tax asset 
that reduction would be effectuated by an increase in the provision or a reduction in the credit for income taxes in our statement of operations  which would have the effect of causing a decline in our operating results 
long lived assets and goodwill 
long lived assets  such as property and equipment and goodwill and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
prior to fiscal  in accordance with gaap  we used estimated undiscounted future cash flows to determine if such an asset was impaired and would reduce its carrying value  by recording a charge against income  in the event that we determined that an impairment had occurred to the value of the asset 
for fiscal years beginning on or after january   we are required to assess our goodwill for impairment  at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  based on standards established by sfas no 
 by comparing the fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 

table of contents during fiscal  we completed a transitional impairment test as required by sfas no 
with respect to our intangible assets  including goodwill 
based on that test  we determined that goodwill had been impaired by million 
as a result  in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded  in our statement of operations for the fiscal year ended december   a non cash goodwill impairment charge in that amount as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
see the paragraph entitled intangible assets in note a to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report for additional information regarding sfas foreign currency translation 
the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of each foreign subsidiary are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period 
revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rate for the reporting period 
foreign currency translation gains and losses not impacting cash flows are credited to or charged against other comprehensive income loss 
foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from cash transactions are credited to or charged against current earnings 
results of operations factors generally affecting sales of rv and boating products we believe that the company is one the largest wholesale distributors of replacement parts  accessories and supplies for recreational vehicles rvs  and boats in north america 
our sales are made to retail parts and supplies stores  service and repair establishments and new and used rv and boat dealers after market customers 
our sales are affected primarily by i usage of rvs and boats by the consumers to whom after market customers sell our products  because such usage affects the consumers needs for and purchases of replacement parts  repair services and supplies  and ii sales of new rvs and boats  because consumers often accessorize their rvs and boats at the time of purchase 
the usage and the purchase  by consumers  of rvs and boats depend  in large measure  upon the extent of discretionary income available to consumers and their confidence about economic conditions 
as a result  recessionary conditions and increases in interest rates often lead to declines in the purchase and  to a lesser extent  in the usage  of rvs and boats 
weather conditions also affect the usage of rvs and boats 
additionally  shortages in the supply of gasoline and  depending on other economic conditions  increases in the prices of gasoline  also can lead to declines in the usage and purchases of rvs and boats 
on the other hand we have found  at least since september   that usage and purchases of rvs also can be affected by geopolitical conditions 
the events of september  appear to have resulted in a decrease both in international travel and in plane travel and a concomitant increase in the usage of rvs 
as a result  our sales and operating results can be  and in the past have been  affected by recessionary economic conditions  increases in interest rates  shortages in the supply and increases in the prices of gasoline  and unusually adverse weather conditions and geopolitical events  as well

as the above table indicates  in operating income more than doubled  and earnings before the cumulative effect of an accounting change for goodwill impairment in increased by  in each case as compared to those improvements were primarily attributable to increases in net sales and improvements in our gross profit margin and a reduction in interest expense  which more than offset an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as previously reported  we adopted sfas  goodwill and intangible assets effective as of january  we determined the amount of the non cash goodwill impairment charge to be  or per share 
as a result of that charge  which was reported as the cumulative effect of an accounting change  we had a net loss of  or a loss per diluted share  in this goodwill impairment charge did not affect the company s tangible net worth or cash flow 
we restated our previously issued and consolidated financial statements to reflect adjustments related to the recording of deferred income taxes on transfers of assets within companies in our consolidated group of companies 
those adjustments were erroneously not made in those two years 
the effect of that restatement was to adjust  in an immaterial amount  our results of operations  as set forth in the table below in thousands  except per share data earnings loss before cumulative effect of accounting change as previously reported as restated net loss as previously reported as restated basic and diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of accounting change as previously reported as restated basic and diluted earnings per share as previously reported as restated 
table of contents net sales 
year ended december  dollars in thousands increase vs 
increase vs 
the increases in net sales in and  as compared to the corresponding periods of their respective prior years  were due to a number of factors  including i relatively stable consumer confidence despite a weakened economy  which we believe is at least partially attributable to low market rates of interest  ii security concerns about foreign travel and travel by air which have  we believe  led to an increase in the usage and purchases of rvs  and iii our progress in implementing our inventory management and deployment program  which has enabled us to improve our service levels to our customers and  we believe  increase our share of rv after market sales 
gross profit year ended december  dollars in thousands gross profit gross margin gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of products sold from net sales 
cost of products sold consist primarily of the amounts paid to manufacturers and suppliers for the products that we purchase for resale  and warehouse and distribution costs  including freight charges 
gross margin is gross profits stated as a percent of net sales 
the increase in our gross margin in  as compared to was due to i a reduction in both freight in and freight out expenses  which was largely a result of the implementation of our inventory management and deployment program  ii the continued strengthening of the canadian dollar  which reduced our canadian subsidiary s cost of sales  and iii a change in the mix of products sold to a higher proportion of higher margin products in as compared to the increase in gross margin in was due to i an overall reduction in the prices that we paid for products purchased from our suppliers due to volume purchases  ii a reduction in freight in costs  net of supplier allowances  associated with receiving product from our suppliers and redistributing it to our regional distribution centers  iii a reduction in warehouse labor costs as a percentage of net sales due to their relatively fixed nature of such costs as compared to our net sales  and iv a reduction in shipping costs as a percentage of net sales due to improved fill rates to our customers 
these reductions were largely attributable to the completion of the implementation phase of our inventory management and deployment system 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of selling and marketing costs  labor and administrative costs  professional fees and expenses and the provision made for uncollectible accounts 
the increase in sg a expenses in  as compared to  was due primarily to increases in labor costs  both selling and administrative  as well as an increase in marketing costs 
however  as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses remained the same in as in 
table of contents the reduction in sg a expenses in  as compared to  was due primarily to i our cost containment efforts that we began in  including reductions in labor costs that resulted from reductions in both the number of employees and in salaries  ii a reduction in marketing and computer expenses and iii the elimination of the amortization of goodwill resulting from the implementation of sfas which is explained in more detail in note b to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the decrease in sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales in  as compared to  was attributable to the combined effects of the increase in net sales and the dollar reduction in such expenses in the majority of our corporate overhead costs are incurred in the united states 
portions of those costs are allocated to our foreign operations to the extent that they directly benefit from the expenses incurred 
operating income year ended december  dollars in thousands operating income loss as a percentage of net sales the doubling of our operating income in as compared to was due to the combined effects of the increase in sales and gross margin  which more than offset the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in operating income in was due to the combined effects of the increases in sales and gross margin and the reduction in sg a expenses 
in  the operating loss was attributable to declines in sales and gross margin 
other income expense year ended december  dollars in thousands other income expense interest expense other total as a percentage of net sales interest expense 
interest expense is the largest component of other income expense 
in interest expense decreased by as compared to in  interest expense decreased by as compared to these decreases were the result of reductions in interest rates during and  and  in  a year over year reduction in average long term borrowings outstanding that was attributable primarily to inventory reductions that we were able to implement as a result of our new inventory management and deployment system 
other income 
other income in was attributable to the sale  to a manufacturer of rv parts  of manufacturing rights and equipment for and inventories of a line of proprietary products that we had been selling not only to our after market customers  but also to recreational vehicle manufacturers 
in  other income was primarily attributable to the sale of the real property where our distribution center in portland  oregon was located 
following that sale  that distribution center was relocated  to a leased facility  also in the portland area 
income tax provision benefit year ended december  dollars in thousands as restated as restated income tax provision benefit effective tax rate as a percentage of net sales see note n to the consolidated financial statements below 

table of contents our effective income tax rate is affected by the amount of our expenses that are not deductible for income tax purposes and by varying tax rates on income generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
the increase in the income tax provision in was primarily attributable to the increase in taxable income 
the increase in income taxes in was primarily attributable to the fact that we recorded an income tax benefit in that was primarily attributable to the loss before income taxes incurred in that year 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash we finance our working capital requirements for our operations primarily with borrowings under a long term revolving credit facility from a bank and internally generated funds 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  we may borrow up to the lesser of i  during the period from march through july  and from  to  during the period from august through february  of each year  or ii an amount equal to of eligible accounts receivable and between to of eligible inventory 
interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at the bank s prime rate plus or  at the company s option but subject to certain limitations  at the bank s libor rate  plus percent 
the bank credit facility matures on may  at march   outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled  our bank borrowings are secured by substantially all of the company s assets and rank senior in priority to other indebtedness of the company 
due to the nature of our business  our primary need for working capital is to finance our accounts receivable and our purchases of inventory 
typically we bill our customers on an open account basis with day  net day terms 
during late fall and winter  however  certain of our customers receive extended payment terms 
we were able in late and to obtain similar extended payment terms from some of our suppliers  which reduced the amounts we had to borrow under our credit facility to make inventory purchases 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain extended payment terms from our suppliers in the future 
if we are unable to do so  we anticipate that it would become necessary either to incur additional borrowings under our credit facility or to extend the payment cycle on outstanding payables  which would adversely affect the discounts we could otherwise obtain from our suppliers 
also  in the event our customers were to delay their payments to us  our payments to our suppliers would have to be funded with additional bank borrowings or would have to be slowed 
we generally use cash for  rather than generate cash from  operations in the first half of the year  because we build inventories  and accounts receivable increase as our customers begin increasing their product purchases for the spring and summer selling seasons 
see seasonality and inflation below 
in an effort to increase our service level to our customers and in anticipation of our annual winter selling show  we increased our inventories by  at december  as a result  in we used net cash of  for operating activities  as compared to  in and net cash provided by operations of  in during  we generated gross proceeds of  from the sale of manufacturing rights and equipment for one of our lines of proprietary products and we received  from the sale of an investment we had in an australian company 
during  we received  from the sale of our portland  oregon distribution facility  which was relocated to a smaller  leased facility in nearby wilsonville  oregon 
capital expenditures were  in as compared to  in and  in these expenditures were primarily for computer enhancements designed to increase the functionality of our computer system  which accounted for a substantial portion of the capital expenditures in  and for the purchase of telephone and warehouse equipment 
borrowings under our credit facility increased by  in and  in and decreased by  in the proceeds from the additional credit facility borrowings in and were used largely to increase product inventories 
in  we also repaid  in other long term debt  the majority of which was owed on the mortgage of the portland  oregon distribution facility that we sold 

table of contents contractual commitments we lease our facilities and certain of our equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
in  rent expense under all operating leases totaled approximately  the following table sets forth our future lease commitments 
year ending december  in thousands thereafter we do not expect any material changes in the uses or our needs for capital or in the sources of funds  and we anticipate that we will be able to fund our cash requirements with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and internally generated funds  during the fiscal year ending december  seasonality and inflation seasonality 
sales of recreational vehicle and boating parts  supplies and accessories are seasonal 
we have significantly higher sales during the six month period from april through september than we do during the remainder of the year 
because substantial portions of our expenses are fixed  operating income declines and we sometimes incur losses and must rely more heavily on borrowings to fund operating requirements in the winter months when sales are lower

see note b to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 

table of contents inflation 
generally  we have been able to pass inflationary price increases on to our customers 
however  inflation also may cause or may be accompanied by increases in gasoline prices and interest rates 
such increases  or even the prospect of increases in the price or shortages in the supply of gasoline or increases in interest rates  can adversely affect the purchase and usage of rvs and boats  which can result in a decline in the demand for the products we sell 
certain factors that could affect future performance statements contained in this annual report that are not historical facts or that discuss our expectations regarding our future operations or future financial performance or trends in our business constitute forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are estimates of future performance or our future financial condition or financial or market trends that are based upon current information and that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual operating results or our financial performance or condition in future periods to differ significantly from those expected at the current time 
those risks and uncertainties include  although they are not limited to  the following our business is seasonal and is subject to various economic and climatic influences 
our sales are affected directly by the usage levels and purchases of rvs and boats 
the purchase and  in particular  the usage of rvs and boats  are affected by weather conditions 
as a result  our sales and operating results ordinarily decline in the winter months and we usually incur losses in these periods of the year 
additionally  unusual weather conditions in a particular season  such as unusually cold weather in the spring or summer months  can cause period to period fluctuations in our sales and financial performance 
the usage and purchases of rvs and boats also are affected by consumers level of discretionary income and their confidence about economic conditions and changes in interest rates and in the availability and cost of gasoline 
as a result  our sales and operating results can be  and in the past have been  adversely affected by the following loss of confidence among consumers regarding economic conditions and the onset of economic recessions  which affect the willingness of consumers to purchase and use their rvs and boats  increases in interest rates which affect the availability and affordability of financing for rvs and boats  shortages in the supply and  to a lesser extent  increases in the costs of gasoline which affect the ability to use and the costs of using rvs and boats  and unusually severe or extended winter weather conditions  which can reduce the usage of rv and boats for periods extending beyond the ordinary winter months or to regions that ordinarily encounter milder winter weather conditions 
these conditions also often lead to increased price competition in our markets which could force us to reduce our prices  thereby reducing sales revenue and our margins 
we rely heavily on bank borrowings in the operation of our business 
we rely heavily on bank borrowings to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
our outstanding borrowings create additional risks for our business 
among other things  we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund expansion or take advantage of other business opportunities  and we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay the principal and interest on our debt 
therefore  our existing debt makes us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and competitive pressures and  as discussed above in this section of this report  the interest we have to pay on such debt impacts our operating results 
the effects of possible changes in supply relationships in our markets 
as is the customary practice in our markets  in most instances we do not have long term supply contracts with our product suppliers 
as a result  product suppliers are free to change the terms on which they will sell us products or to discontinue supplying us with products altogether  because they may choose to distribute their products directly to after market dealers or because they might choose to establish exclusive supply relationships with other distributors 
additionally  manufacturers of new rvs and boats may choose to incorporate optional equipment on their rvs and boats at the time of manufacture that  historically were provided to their dealers by distributors such as the company 
any of these occurrences could result in increased competition in our markets or reduce the number of products we are able to offer our customers  which could cause our sales to decline and could result in lower margins 

table of contents additional uncertainties are discussed above in this section of this report  including  in particular  in the introductory portion of this section that discusses our accounting policies and estimates and the effects those policies and estimates can have on our future financial position and operating results 
due to these and other possible uncertainties and risks  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements contained in this report  which speak only as of the date of this annual report 
we also disclaim any obligation to update forward looking information contained in this report  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk with respect to financial instruments is primarily related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowing activities  which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
to a lesser degree  we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency fluctuations associated with our canadian operations and our canadian currency denominated debt 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any derivative financial instruments 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
the fair value of borrowings under our revolving credit facility approximates the carrying value of such obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility 
we sometimes enter into forward exchange agreements to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on a portion of our inventory purchases in canada for our canadian operations 
the gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in earnings in the period during which the transactions being hedged are recognized 
we believe that these agreements do not subject us to significant market risk from exchange rate movements because the agreements offset gains and losses on the balances and transactions being hedged 
as of december   there were no such agreements outstanding 
approximately of our debt is denominated in canadian currency  which also exposes us to market risk associated with exchange rate movements 
historically  we have not used derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations since the market risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt has not been considered significant
