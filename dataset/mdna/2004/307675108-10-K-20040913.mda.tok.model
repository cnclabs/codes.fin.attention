item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors 
the results of operations for the years ended june   and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 
the following discussion should be read in combination with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this report and with the risk factors described below 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory valuation  including lifo reserves  the allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred tax assets  liabilities related to retirement benefits  liabilities resulting from self insurance of our worker s compensation liabilities  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other relevant factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  actual results may differ from these estimates  which could require the company to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 
investments our investments consist of investment grade marketable debt instruments issued by the us government and major us and foreign corporations  equity securities  primarily preferred stock  and various derivative instruments  primarily exchange traded treasury futures and options  green coffee forward contracts and commodity purchase agreements 
all derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are marked to market and changes are recognized in current earnings 
the fair value of derivative instruments is based upon broker quotes where possible 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to meet their obligations 
our ability to maintain a relatively small reserve is directly related to our ability to collect from our customers when our sales people regularly interact with our customers in person 
this method of operation has provided us with a historically low bad debt experience 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and the costs of coffee and allied products are determined on the last in  first out lifo basis 
costs of coffee brewing equipment manufactured are accounted for on the first in  first out fifo basis 
we regularly evaluate these inventories to determine that market conditions are correctly reflected in the recorded carrying value 
self insurance retention we are self insured for california workers compensation insurance and use historical analysis to determine and record the estimates of expected future expenses resulting from worker s compensation claims 
additionally  we accrue for estimated losses not covered by insurance for liability  auto  medical and fire up to the deductible amounts 
retirement plans we have two defined benefit plans that provide retirement benefits for the majority of our employees the balance of our employees are covered by union defined benefit plans 
we obtain actuarial valuations for both plans and at present we discount the pension obligations using discount rate and we estimate an return on plan assets 
our retiree medical plan is not funded and shares the same discount rate as the defined benefit plans 
we also project an initial medical trend rate of ultimately reducing to in years 
the performance of the stock market and other investments as well as the overall health of the economy can have a material effect on pension investment returns and these assumptions 
a change in these assumptions could have an effect on operating results 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse 
we do not presently have a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets as we currently believe it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources we have been able to maintain a strong working capital position  and believe that our short and long term cash requirements for the coming year will be provided by internal sources 
as reported in the form q a dated february   on december   the company purchased  shares pre split of its common stock held by the crowe family and related trusts for approximately million  or approximately per share pre split 
concurrently with this purchase  the company offered its employee stock ownership plan esop the opportunity to acquire  shares pre split at the same price 
this portion of the transaction was completed on january  when the company issued said shares to the esop 
this fulfilled a previously announced commitment to fund the esop with  shares pre split by completing the purchase at a significant discount to market price 
the closing price for farmer bros 
co 
common stock on december  was per share pre split 
please review note to the accompanying financial statements for additional information 
the transaction can be summarized as follows cost of shares purchased  cost of shares retired  cost of shares transferred to esop  the esop  established in for all farmer bros 
co 
employees  is a leveraged esop 
this compensation plan allocates shares to employees as the company makes its annual benefit contribution to the plan 
the shares are held for employees by a third party trustee 
when employees retire or leave the company  they can receive the stock or cash 
cash amounts are based on the market price of the stock 
the company must make a market in the stock for the esop participants 
at this time  based on allocated shares  the company has a re funding liability of approximately  our working capital is composed of the following in thousands current assets    current liabilities    working capital    capital expenditures    we have no major commitments for capital expenditures at this time 
the following projects will require a commitment of funds we have started construction of a warehouse in chico  california and expect to begin construction shortly of another building in bakersfield  california to replace existing facilities in those locations 
we expect to complete construction in time to occupy both new warehouses before the end of fiscal the combined cost of improvements for the two warehouses is not expected to exceed  we have completed the second year of a multi year upgrading of our internal management information system 
to date we have expended million for hardware  software  infrastructure  training  consulting and on going support 
our financial systems general ledger  accounts receivable  accounts payable  fixed assets and payroll were converted to the new system on july  on september   we converted our manufacturing systems and expect to convert our sales systems before the end of fiscal costs to complete this project  including software  hardware and consulting configuration of software in  may exceed  not including the added fixed costs to maintain the new system 
results of operations years ended june  and net sales in fiscal decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal this includes a decrease in coffee brewing equipment sales during fiscal of million 
our sales force has persisted in its efforts throughout this recession 
we expect better results as the economy begins to improve 
some improvement has been noted 
comparing fourth quarter to fourth quarter  two of our ten selling divisions had sales declines of less than and one  in the mississippi valley  had a sales increase 
some trade reports as well as published operating results from some restaurant operators seem to indicate that restaurant sales have improved 
the national restaurant association has forecasted that industry sales will increase for calendar a trade publication  the restaurant news  reports that restaurant sales in the first four months of calendar were percent higher than during the same period of calendar we have not kept pace with this trend but we note that regional results often do not reflect national averages 
our california operations  representing our largest marketing area  continue to show limited improvement 
consumer sentiment and spending patterns are not enhanced by rising commodity prices leading to higher grocery store and menu prices  record high gasoline prices which can have an emotional effect on discretionary spending  and uncertainty about job stability  terrorism and the iraq war which can lead to just staying home 
cost of goods sold in fiscal increased to  or of sales  as compared to  or of sales  in the average cost of green coffee throughout fiscal has exceeded that of fiscal by 
through price adjustments we were  on average  able to maintain margins for the current year  although shrinking gross profit margins were experienced during the last half of the fiscal year 
selling and general administrative expenses in increased to  from  in fiscal this increase is primarily attributed to costs associated with employee benefits  including actuarially derived pension and retiree medical costs  the cost of the esop  legal expenses  including those related to a stockholder lawsuit during and reincorporation in delaware  and our multiyear program to update our information systems as well as the direct costs of our sarbanes oxley act of sox compliance work related to section employee benefits   esop   legal expenses  it project expenses  sox compliance total   as a result of these factors  operating income in decreased to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
other income decreased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal low interest rates have limited investment returns  and the expenditure of more than million to purchase stock reduced the amount available for investment 
additionally  the company s chairman  roy f 
farmer  who guided the company for more than years  died on march  as more fully described in a form k filed march  
the company received payment of a key man life insurance policy on mr 
farmer that is not taxable and paid the deferred compensation due mr 
farmer 
the company prevailed in a lawsuit against the california franchise tax board regarding taxability of dividends 
as a result we received a tax refund of  and interest income of  the company received another court award  as a plaintiff in a class action lawsuit regarding price fixing by sellers of monosodium glutamate 
the non recurring items in other income include the following 
key man life insurance  court award  interest on state tax refunds  total  net income for fiscal decreased to  as compared to  in fiscal income per share decreased in fiscal to per share as compared to per share in fiscal years ended june  and net sales in fiscal decreased to  as compared to  in fiscal during this period the company continued to experience a decline in coffee sales 
there are a number of trends that we believe affect this result 
fiscal was the third year of an economic downturn that has been especially hard on our core service area of california 
our entire state service area has felt the combination of lay offs  job uncertainty and the high cost of living that can restrict consumer spending 
our primary market is the independently owned and operated restaurant and restaurant chains 
a weaker economy is especially hard on these entrepreneurs who do not have the geographic or thematic diversity of the large restaurant chains 
the success of coffee shops selling specialty coffees has spawned many imitators 
although we compete favorably with our own line of specialty coffees  our customers feel the effect of fewer sales dollars in part because of the recession being divided among more direct competitors 
green coffee costs for fiscal increased approximately over those of fiscal as a result gross profit decreased to  or of sales  in fiscal as compared to  or of sales  in fiscal selling expenses for the fiscal year increased to  as compared to  in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to  as compared to  in fiscal operating expenses  composed of selling and general and administrative expenses  increased  or  to  during fiscal  or of sales  as compared to  or of sales  in fiscal this increase primarily reflects additional costs in the following order esop  computer consulting and training  insurance including workers compensation  life insurance  defined benefit and post retirement benefit plan costs  and the cost of coffee brewing equipment  these were partially offset by decreases in legal expenses  and payroll  other income in fiscal increased  or to  as compared to  in fiscal this is primarily the result of the volatility of the capital markets introduced by an accounting change in that required unrealized gains and losses on investments to be realized as incurred 
prior to that time our hedging efforts reduced much of this volatility 
interest rates declined throughout fiscal the major components of this change from included an increase in unrealized gains of  offset by decreases in interest income of  and realized losses  and realized gains  pretax income in fiscal decreased to  or of sales  as compared to  or of sales  in fiscal net income in fiscal decreased to  or of sales  as compared to  or of sales in fiscal earnings per share in fiscal decreased to as compared to in fiscal risk factors certain statements contained in this annual report on form k regarding the risks  circumstances and financial trends that may affect our future operating results  financial position and cash flows may be forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws 
these statements are based on management s current expectations  assumptions  estimates and observations about our business and are subject to risks and uncertainties 
as a result  actual results could materially differ from the forward looking statements contained herein 
these forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words like expects  plans  believes  intends  will  assumes and other words of similar meanings 
these and other similar words can be identified by the fact that they do not relate solely to historical or current facts 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  we caution that it is impossible to predict the impact of such factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results 
we intend these forward looking statements to speak only at the time of this report and do not undertake to update or revise these projections as more information becomes available 
for these statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements provided by the private securities litigation reform act of factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those expressed or implied by any forward looking statements described herein include green coffee price volatility 
our results of operations can vary dramatically with the volatility of the green coffee market 
coffee is mainly grown outside the united states and can be subject to volatile price fluctuations 
weather  real or perceived shortages  labor actions and political unrest in coffee producing nations  and government actions  including treaties and trade controls between the us and coffee producing nations  can affect the price of green coffee 
price volatility can result in dramatic cost increases that cannot  because of competition and market conditions  be immediately passed on to our customers 
competition 
competition comes in many forms 
we compete with other coffee companies  include multi national firms with vast financial resources 
large roasters like folgers proctor gamble and maxwell house kraft have volumes far in excess of ours  with a business model and information and distribution technologies that are substantially different from ours 
we compete for a wide variety of customers  from small restaurants and donut shops to large institutional buyers like hospitals  hotels  contract food services and convalescent hospitals 
at farmer bros 
we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by the quality of our products and customer service 
some customers are price buyers  seeking the low cost provider with little concern about service  others find great value in the service programs we provide 
we compete well when service is valued  and are less effective when only price matters 
some of our competitors do not do their own distribution  and some customers do 
we also compete with other beverages 
there are many beverages  hot and cold  competing for the same restaurant dollar 
our restaurant customers report that competition from such beverages continues to dilute demand for coffee 
consumers who choose soft drinks  bottled water  and flavored coffees and teas are all reducing the restaurant dollar formerly spent on a standard cup of coffee 
some restaurants that only sell coffee and flavored coffee products may have expanded the beverage market somewhat  but these coffee shops have also taken market share from existing farmer bros 
customers 
although we have a line of products that compares favorably with products sold in such specialty coffee stores  most of our customers are restaurants that do not specialize in coffee drinks 
sales and distribution network 
we believe our sales and distribution network is one of the best in the industry 
this network is costly to maintain 
costs include the fluctuating cost of gasoline  diesel and oil  the costs associated with managing  purchasing  maintaining and insuring a fleet of delivery vehicles  the costs of maintaining distribution warehouses throughout the country  the costs of hiring  training and managing our route sales professionals 
many of these costs are beyond our control  and others are more in the nature of fixed than variable costs 
some competitors use alternate methods of distribution that eliminate some of the costs associated with our method of distribution 
general economic and market conditions 
our primary market is restaurants and other food service establishments 
we also provide coffee and related products to offices 
we believe the success of our market segment is dependent upon personal and business expenditures in restaurants and other food service businesses 
in a slow economy  businesses and individuals scale back their discretionary spending on travel and entertainment  including dining out 
economic conditions may also cause businesses to reduce travel and entertainment expenses  and even cause office coffee benefits to be eliminated 
self insurance 
we are self insured for many risks up to significant deductible amounts 
the premiums associated with our insurance have recently increased substantially 
general liability  fire  workers compensation  directors and officers liability  life  employee medical  dental and vision and automobile present a large potential liability 
while we accrue for this liability based on historical experience  future losses may exceed losses we have incurred in the past 
risks from possible acquisitions and new business ventures 
the company regularly evaluates opportunities that may enhance stockholder value 
there is no assurance that any such venture  should we decide to enter into one  will accrue the projected returns 
it is possible that such ventures could result in losses or returns that would have a negative impact on operating income 
esop 
the farmer bros 
co 
employee stock ownership plan was designed to help us attract and retain employees and to better align the efforts of our employees with the interests of our stockholders 
to that end  the company has purchased  shares pre split of stock for the esop to allocate to employees over the next years 
it is possible that additional shares could be acquired that might deplete the company s cash 
we expect that the future re funding liability of the existing shares in the esop will increase and require additional investment as the esop matures and individual holdings grow 
when employees vested in the esop leave the company  they have the right to put their shares to the company for cash 
this requires the company to repurchase the shares at the current market value 
when shares are fully distributed  the company s refunding liability is approximately  at current share prices 
natural disasters 
over half of our business is conducted in california  oregon and washington 
this area is prone to seismic activity and a major earthquake could have a significant negative effect on our operations 
our major manufacturing facility and distribution hub is in los angeles  and a serious interruption to highway arteries  gas mains or electrical service could restrict our ability to supply our branches with product 
labor actions 
we have union contracts relating to our employees serving our california  oregon  washington and nevada markets 
although we believe union relations have been amicable in the past  there is no assurance that this will continue in the future 
there are potential adverse effects of labor disputes with our own employees or by others who provide transportation shipping lines  truck drivers or cargo handling longshoremen  both domestic and foreign  of our raw materials or other products 
these actions could restrict our ability to obtain  process and or distribute our products 
pension plan viability 
we participate in two multi employer defined benefit plans for certain union employees 
the management and funding status and future viability of these plans is not known at this time 
the nature of the contract with these plans allows for future funding demands that are outside our control or ability to estimate 
erp system conversion 
during fiscal the company began a multiyear program to update its management information systems 
this has proven to be a challenging conversion 
it is possible that continuing conversion costs  potential complications resulting from the conversion itself and system problems related to our use of the new software could have a material impact on our future operating results 
depth of management 
there is limited management depth in certain key positions throughout the company  and the unexpected loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations and competitive position 
purchasing activities 
the most important aspect of our operation is to secure a consistent supply of coffee 
maintaining a steady supply of green coffee is essential to keep inventory levels low and sufficient stock to meet customer needs 
to help ensure future supplies  we purchase much of our coffee on forward contracts for delivery as long as six months in the future 
in the event of non performance by the counter parties  the company could be exposed to credit and supply risk 
the company monitors the financial viability of the counter parties in an attempt to minimize this risk 
entering into such future commitments leaves the company subject to purchase price risk 
various techniques are used to hedge these purchases against untoward price movement 
competitive factors make it difficult for the company to pass through such price fluctuation to its customers 
therefore  unpredictable price changes can have an immediate effect on operating results that cannot be corrected in the short run 
futures contracts not designated as hedges  and terminations of contracts designated as hedges  are marked to market and changes are recognized in current earnings

a basis point move in the general level of interest rates would result in a change in the market value of the portfolio of approximately  our portfolio of preferred securities includes investments in derivatives that provide a natural economic hedge of interest rate risk 
we review the interest rate sensitivity of these securities and a enter into short positions in futures contracts on us treasury securities or b hold put options on such futures contracts in order to reduce the impact of certain interest rate changes on such preferred stocks 
specifically  we attempt to manage the risk arising from changes in the general level of interest rates
