investing activities in december  cott acquired the retailer brand beverage business of north carolina s quality beverage brands  llc qbb 
in conjunction with that acquisition  cott also entered into long term manufacturing agreements at market rates with independent beverage corporation  an affiliate of qbb 
the acquisition and related agreements are expected to enhance cott s capabilities and to expand its customer base in the mid atlantic region of the united states  and as a result cott expects to add approximately million a year to its sales in the united states  some of which will include sales to new customers 
cott believes that there are substantial growth opportunities in mexico 
for that reason  it acquired interest in cemsa  a mexican soft drink manufacturer  in in may  cemsa acquired a soft drink distribution business from embotelladora de puebla  sa de sa epsa to expand its business and improve its profitability in mexico 
in january  cott acquired the remaining interest in iroquois west bottling ltd 
iroquois west  to strengthen its position in the spring water segment across canada

the acquisitions were funded from cash and borrowings on cott s revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million in as compared with million in major expenditures in included million for improvements to the mexico plant and information technology improvements of million 
in  cott spent million on manufacturing equipment primarily in the us to meet the needs of cott s growing business 
capital resources and long term debt cott s sources of capital include operating cash flows  short term borrowings under current credit facilities  issuance of public and private debt and issuance of equity securities 
management believes cott has adequate financial resources to meet its ongoing cash requirements for operations and capital expenditures  as well as its other financial obligations based on its operating cash flows and current available credit 
cott has a committed senior secured credit facility in the united states and canada 
the credit facility terminates  and the debt under that agreement is due  on december  that facility allows for revolving credit borrowings in a principal amount of up to  this amount was increased on december  from  this facility can be increased by a further million at cott s option if lenders agree to increase their commitments 
as of january   the outstanding amount of revolving credit loans was million 
cott corporation and cott beverages inc are co borrowers on the facility  but the debt is guaranteed by most of cott s us and canada subsidiaries 
the debt and guarantees are secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and the guarantors 
cott also has outstanding senior subordinated notes  which are due in as of january   the principal amount of those notes was million 
the issuer of the notes is cott beverages inc  but the notes are guaranteed by cott and most of its us and canada subsidiaries 
cott also has a credit facility in the uk that facility  which replaced a prior one on february   is a demand facility 
this facility is scheduled to terminate december  although demand for payment may be made at any time 
under that facility  cott uk may borrow up to million pounds uk million at the january  exchange rate 
cott s current credit facilities provide maximum credit of million 
at january   approximately million of the senior secured credit facility in the us and canada and million of the us credit facility in the uk were available 
the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities was as of january  overdraft borrowings under the uk credit facility bear interest at the bank s short term offered rate plus except for us dollar borrowings where the margin is currently 
term borrowings under this facility include a margin of 
long term debt as of january  was million  compared with million at the end of at january   long term debt consisted of million in senior subordinated notes with a stated face value of million  and million of other debt 
in  cott repaid its million term bank loan  which reduced its long term debt repayments in and to million and million  respectively 
the senior secured credit facility and the indenture respecting the notes contain a number of business and financial covenants and events of default that apply to the borrowers and the restricted subsidiaries 
the restricted subsidiaries are  in general  the guarantor subsidiaries organized in canada and the us among other events of default or triggers for prepayment in cott s credit facilities and indenture are a change of control of cott in certain circumstances  cross default or cross acceleration to other indebtedness in excess of million  unsatisfied judgments in excess of million  insolvency of cott or the restricted subsidiaries  and covenant default under the indenture or credit facilities 
some of the more material business and financial covenants are discussed below 
the senior secured credit facility restricts additional indebtedness for subsidiaries to the existing debt and credit facilities  certain intercompany debt  million of subordinated debt to unrestricted subsidiaries  million of purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations  million of guarantee obligations and a million basket of other additional indebtedness 
the senior secured credit facility contains restrictions on investments including investments in subsidiaries outside of the us or canada and acquisitions 
in general  individual acquisitions are permitted up to million with the aggregate expenditure for all acquisitions limited to million in any fiscal year 
there is also a restriction on disposition of assets having a fair market value exceeding million in a fiscal year with certain specified exemptions 
restricted payments such as dividends or capital stock purchases are currently limited to of consolidated net income but that amount drops to of consolidated net income if the leverage ratio exceeds to capital expenditures in the and canada are limited  in the aggregate  to million plus a carry forward of the unused current permitted capital expenditures from the prior year 
there are further restrictions in several of the covenants  such as a complete prohibition on paying any dividends  if cott is in default under the senior secured credit agreement 
in addition  many of the covenants effectively limit transactions with cott s unrestricted subsidiaries or non guarantor entities 
finally  there are additional business covenants in cott s uk credit facility  but the amounts committed for borrowing under those facilities are immaterial in amount and  therefore  those covenants are not material to cott s operations 
in addition to business covenants  there are financial covenants in the senior secured credit facility 
since the fourth quarter of  cott s leverage ratio was required to be no more than to and that requirement is tightened to to in the third quarter of and tightens further to to in the second quarter of at the end of  cott s leverage ratio was to the senior secured credit facility also has an interest coverage test and a fixed charge test 
at the end of and during  cott s interest coverage ratio must be at least to and by the fourth quarter of it must be at least to as of january  it was to cott s fixed charge coverage ratio had to be at least to at the end of that required ratio increases each quarter during until the required ratio at the end of the year is to 
at january   cott s fixed charge coverage ratio was to the indenture for the notes also has numerous covenants that are applicable to cott beverages inc  cott and the restricted subsidiaries 
cott can only make restricted payments  such as paying dividends  buying back stock or making certain investments  if its fixed charge coverage ratio is at least to even then  cott can only make those restricted payments in an amount that is no greater than of its consolidated net income subject to certain adjustments 
certain other investments  like those not exceeding million in the aggregate  may be made without satisfying the restricted payments test 
cott can only incur additional debt or issue preferred stock  other than certain specified debt  if its fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than to for purposes of the indenture  cott s fixed charge coverage ratio was to as of january  subject to some exceptions  asset sales may only be made where the sale price is equal to the fair market value of the asset sold and cott receives at least of the proceeds in cash 
there are also limitations on what cott may do with the sale proceeds such that it may be required to pay down debt or reinvest the proceeds in enumerated business uses within a specified period of time 
there are further restrictions in several of the covenants  such as a complete prohibition on paying any dividends  if cott is in default under the indenture 
many of the covenants also effectively limit transactions with cott s unrestricted subsidiaries or non guarantor entities 
several of the terms  like restricted payments  are defined differently in the indenture and the senior secured credit facility and certain calculations are made differently in the two agreements 
there are also certain financial covenants in cott s uk facility  but the amounts committed for borrowing under that facility are immaterial in amount and  therefore  those financial covenants are not material to cott s operations 
cott believes it has sufficient financial flexibility under the terms of its indebtedness to operate its business as currently planned 
capital structure in  shareowners equity increased by million from the following contributed to this increase net income of million  additional share capital of million from the exercise of employee stock options  including the related tax benefit  and million in favorable foreign currency translation on the net assets of self sustaining foreign operations all contributed to the increase 
the foreign currency translation adjustment resulted from the strengthening of the uk pound and the canadian dollar compared with the us dollar 
dividend payments no dividends were paid in cott does not expect to resume dividend payments to common shareowners in as it intends to use cash for future growth or debt repayment 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends under cott s credit facility and notes indenture 
the most restrictive provision is the quarterly limitation of dividends based on the prior quarter s earnings 
cott currently can pay dividends subject to these limitations but does not intend to do so 
contractual obligations the following chart shows the schedule of future payments under certain contracts  including debt agreements and guarantees  as of january  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in millions notes operating leases other critical accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of cott s consolidated financial statements 
cott s critical accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on historical experience  the advice of external experts or on other assumptions management believes to be reasonable 
where actuals differ from estimates  revisions are included in the results of the period in which actuals become known 
historically  differences between estimates and actuals have not had a significant impact on cott s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements are discussed with cott s audit committee as they are implemented and on an annual basis and include the following revenue recognition cott reports sales when ownership passes to customers for products manufactured in its own plants and or by third parties 
management regularly evaluates the facts and circumstances in relation to the criteria in the eitf and uses its best judgment to determine whether to report sales on a gross or net basis for products manufactured by third parties 
currently  the facts and circumstances surrounding all of cott s business support the reporting of all sales on a gross basis 
cott offers sales incentives to certain customers 
cott accounts for these incentives as a reduction from sales 
cott follows the guidance under eitf in accounting for sales incentives 
where the incentive has been paid in advance  cott amortizes the amount based on expected future sales related to the incentive 
where the incentive is to be paid in arrears  cott accrues the amount based on expected future sales related to the incentive 
impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life with the implementation of sfas in  goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are no longer amortized  but instead are tested annually for impairment 
any impairment loss is recognized in income 
cott has goodwill of million and rights of million on its balance sheet at january  in accordance with sfas  cott evaluates goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis 
the evaluation of goodwill for each reporting unit is based upon the following approach 
cott compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
where the carrying value is greater than the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any of the remainder being allocated to goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine the impairment loss 
cott measures the fair value of reporting units using discounted future cash flows 
since the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity  the discounted future cash flow includes a terminal value 
the long term growth assumptions incorporated into the discounted cash flow calculation reflect cott s long term view of the market and the discount rate is based on cott s weighted average cost of capital 
each year cott re evaluates the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment 
based on the evaluation performed this year  cott s determined that the fair values of its reporting units exceeded their carrying value and that as a result the second step of the impairment test was not required 
cott s only intangible asset with an indefinite life relates to its acquisition of intellectual property from royal crown company  inc including the right to manufacture cott concentrates  with all related inventions  processes  technologies  technical and manufacturing information and know how 
there is an indefinite contractual life to cott s ownership of these rights  and there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic  or other factors that limit the useful life 
in accordance with sfas  based on the above factors  the life of the rights is considered to be indefinite and they are not amortized  but are tested annually for impairment 
impairment of an intangible asset with an indefinite life  if any  is determined using the same discounted future cash flow assumptions and model discussed above for goodwill 
cott compares the carrying value of the rights to their fair value and recognizes in income any impairment in value 
other intangible assets other intangible assets consist principally of customer relationships that arise from acquisitions which amounted to million at january  customer relationships are amortized on a straight line basis for the period over which cott expects to receive economic benefits 
cott periodically compares the carrying value of customer relationships by customer to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the related business and recognizes any impairment in its income statement 
the expected life and value of these intangible assets is based on an evaluation of competitive environment  customer history and future prospects as appropriate 
income taxes cott regularly reviews the recognized and unrecognized deferred income tax assets to determine whether or not a valuation allowance is required 
management believes that virtually all deferred tax assets will be realized as a result of anticipated future taxable income from operations 
the loss carry forwards of million relate primarily to canada and a significant change in the volumes or profitability of these operations could affect the realization of the deferred tax assets 
canadian gaap cott makes available to all shareowners consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with canadian gaap and files these financial statements with canadian regulatory authorities 
results reported under canadian gaap may differ from results reported under us gaap from time to time 
under canadian gaap in  cott reported net income of million and total assets of million compared to net income and total assets reported under us gaap of million and million  respectively 
there are no material us canadian gaap differences for under canadian gaap in  cott reported net income of million and total assets of million compared to net income and total assets reported under us gaap of million and million  respectively 
there were two primary us canadian gaap differences for first  under canadian gaap  the and notes were considered discharged on december  when the funds to redeem the notes were transferred to an irrevocable trust 
as a result  debt extinguishment costs were recorded in the fourth quarter of under canadian gaap 
under us gaap  however  the and notes were considered discharged on january   and extinguishment costs of million  which were million after deferred income tax recovery  were recorded in the first quarter of second  under canadian gaap  the impairment loss of million relating to the change in the method for valuing goodwill is charged to opening retained earnings for the first quarter of under us gaap  the change in accounting principle is recorded as a charge to net income for versus results of operations income from continuing operations in was reported as million or per diluted share as compared with million or per diluted share in results were revised to million or per diluted share to reflect the implementation of sfas  which no longer allows early debt redemption costs to be recorded as extraordinary items 
net income for was million or per share after taking into account the change in accounting principle and related charge of million for goodwill relating to the uk sales sales in were  million compared with  million in excluding the impact of the acquisitions discussed below and the k mart bankruptcy  sales were  million for  an increase of from  million in beverage volumes increased in the existing us and canadian businesses and were partially offset by lower sales in the uk in the us  sales of million in increased from million in of the increased sales  million was as a result of the wyomissing acquisition and nrb business combination 
us sales were also impacted by the k mart bankruptcy in as sales to this customer decreased million in compared with excluding the impact of wyomissing  nrb and k mart  us sales of million were up in compared with  due principally to increased sales to existing customers 
sales in canada of million increased from million in approximately  one third of the increase was driven by increased promotional activities with existing customers  one third by new product launches and retailer brand relaunches and the remainder by expanded spring water business 
sales in the uk europe were million in  a decrease of from million in excluding the impact of foreign exchange due to the strengthening uk pound in relation to the uk dollar  sales decreased 
approximately one quarter of the decrease was due to discontinuing sales of certain products and relationships with certain customers 
the remaining decrease was due to more emphasis on national brands by some uk retailers 
sales in the international segment were million in compared with million in the cemsa acquisition in contributed million to the increase and the remaining increase was due to the royal crown acquisition in gross profit gross profit was of sales for compared with in higher margins resulted primarily from operating efficiency improvements in the uk  such as reduced usage of external warehousing  improved yields as well as the impact of acquiring the royal crown assets 
the royal crown acquisition had a percentage point positive effect on cott s gross profit margins by significantly reducing concentrate costs 
cott self manufactures most of its concentrate requirements as a result of this acquisition 
the margin improvement from the royal crown acquisition was partially offset by the increased interest expense relating to the acquisition 
gross profit was also favorably impacted by the continuous cost improvement programs such as increasing lines speed  ensuring the optimal fill height of bottles  decreasing change over times and improving suppliers quality  which contributed to operating efficiencies across cott plants 
cost of sales was of sales in  percentage points better than variable costs represented about of total cost of sales and fixed costs represented about 
major components of cost of sales included ingredients and packaging costs  fees paid to third party manufacturers  logistics and freight costs and depreciation and amortization 
in  about of cott s beverage products were manufactured in facilities it owns or leases or by third party manufacturers with whom cott has long term co packing agreements 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a was million in  up million from million for sg a increased as a percent of sales from to 
excluding the impact of acquisitions and goodwill amortization  of million and million  respectively  sg a was million  an increase of million from approximately million of the increase is due to one time reorganization charges in the uk that were recorded in the first quarter 
the remaining increase reflects higher employee costs as headcount was increased to meet current and future growth in the us business  and million of incremental information technology spending 
interest expense net interest expense was million in compared with million for interest on the term loan to finance the royal crown acquisition and the nrb business combination resulted in an increase of million 
the december refinancing of the and notes with senior subordinated notes maturing in lowered interest expense by million 
interest savings in would have been higher except that cott had to pay interest for most of the month of january on both the notes and the and notes 
the and notes were repaid from funds held in trust on january  the refinancing lowered cott s average interest rate on its high yield notes by one percentage point 
other expense income  net other expense in was million compared to income of million in the difference is primarily due to debt extinguishment costs of million recorded in the first quarter of partially offset by a gain on the sale of cott s remaining interest in menu foods limited recorded in the second quarter of income taxes cott recorded an income tax provision of million reflecting an effective tax rate of as compared with million for an effective rate of in the decrease in the effective tax rate in principally reflects a lower statutory rate in canada  restructuring of internal debt in the third quarter of the year and realization of the benefit of a capital loss in the first quarter 
the effective tax rate was also lowered as cott recorded a million tax benefit relating to prior period loss carryforwards by decreasing the valuation allowance 
cott expects to be able to utilize prior period tax loss carryforwards as a result of acquisitions made in change in accounting principle in  cott adopted sfas for goodwill and intangibles acquired prior to june  under this standard  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests based on fair values rather than net recoverable amount 
an impairment test of goodwill was required upon adoption of this standard 
cott completed the impairment test of its reporting units in the first quarter under the new rules and as a consequence recorded a non cash charge of million to write down the entire goodwill of its uk business 
canadian gaap under canadian gaap in  cott reported net income of million and total assets of million compared to the net income and total assets under us gaap of million and million  respectively 
there were two primary us canadian gaap differences for the year ended december  as described in the canadian gaap analysis 
in  the primary difference was the treatment of the discharge of the and notes as described in the canadian gaap analysis 
under canadian gaap in  cott reported net income of million and total assets of million compared to net income and total assets under u 
s gaap of million and  million 
outlook cott s ongoing focus is to increase sales  market share and profitability for cott and its customers 
while the carbonated soft drink industry continues to experience slow growth  the retailer brand segment is experiencing significant positive growth  especially in the us however  there is intense price competition from heavily promoted global and regional brands in the beverage industry  cott s major opportunity for growth depends on management s execution of its strategies and on retailers continued commitment to their retailer brand soft drink programs 
in  cott intends to continue to strive to expand the business through growing sales with existing customers  the pursuit of new customers and channels and through new acquisitions and alliances 
cott is not able to accurately predict the success or timing of such efforts 
as of the date of this report  sales are expected to grow between and for the majority of this growth is expected to be through existing businesses 
along with sales growth from major customers  management also believes there are significant opportunities for growth in the us market as retailer brand penetration is not currently as high as in other markets 
the canadian division intends to focus on innovation and entry into new channels 
we believe that the uk business has stabilized and continued efforts are expected to further improve earnings 
we also believe that significant growth opportunities exist in mexico 
mexico has a population of approximately million and it is second only to the united states in per capita consumption of soft drinks 
as of the date of this report  cott expects earnings per share  on a diluted basis  to rise to between and and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for to be the following in millions income from continuing operations depreciation and amortization interest expense  net income taxes ebitda total capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million 
ebitda is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
cott uses operating income as its primary measure of performance and cash flow from operations as its primary measure of liquidity 
nevertheless  cott presents ebitda in its filings for several reasons 
first  cott uses multiples of ebitda and discounted cash flows in determining the value of its operations 
in addition  cott uses cash return on assets  which is a financial measure calculated by dividing cott s annualized ebitda by its aggregate operating assets  for the purposes of calculating performance related bonus compensation for its management employees  because that measure reflects the ability of management to generate cash while preserving assets 
finally  cott includes ebitda in its filings because it believes that its current and potential investors use multiples of ebitda to make investment decisions about cott 
investors should not consider ebitda an alternative to net income  nor to cash provided by operating activities nor any other indicator of performance or liquidity  which have been determined in accordance with us or canadian gaap 
cott s method of calculating ebitda may differ from the methods used by other companies and  accordingly  cott s ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
risks and uncertainties we face a number of risks and uncertainties  including the following competitive environment the markets for cott s products are extremely competitive 
in comparison to the major national brand beverage manufacturers  cott is a relatively small participant in the industry 
cott faces competition from the national brand beverage manufacturers in all of its markets and from other retailer brand beverage manufacturers in the united states and the united kingdom 
if cott s competitors reduce their selling prices or increase the frequency of their promotional activities in cott s core markets or if cott s customers do not allocate adequate shelf space for beverages supplied by cott  cott could lose market share or be forced to reduce pricing or increase capital and other expenditures  any of which could adversely affect cott s profitability 
reliance on a small number of customers a significant portion of cott s sales are concentrated in a small number of customers 
cott s customers include many large national and regional grocery  mass merchandise  drugstore  wholesale and convenience store chains in cott s core markets of the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
sales to cott s top customer in and accounted for and  respectively  of the company s total sales and sales to the top ten customers were of total sales in and cott expects that sales of its products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of cott s sales in the foreseeable future 
the loss of any significant customer  or customers which in the aggregate represent a significant portion of cott s sales  could have a material adverse effect on cott s operating results and cash flows 
at january   cott has million of customer relationships recorded as an intangible asset 
the permanent loss of any customer included in the intangible asset will result in an impairment in the value of the intangible asset 
stability of procurement costs the principal ingredients required to produce cott s products are concentrates  sweeteners and carbon dioxide 
cott makes most of the concentrates it needs using ingredients from third parties and sources the remaining concentrates and other ingredients from outside vendors 
cott s purchases its primary packaging supplies  including polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles  caps and pet preforms  cans and lids  labels  cartons and trays  from outside vendors 
cott has a variety of suppliers for many of its materials  and cott maintains long standing relationships with many of these suppliers 
cott typically enters into annual supply arrangements rather than long term contracts with its suppliers  which means that cott s suppliers are obligated to continue to supply it with materials for one year periods  at the end of which cott must either renegotiate the contract with the incumbent supplier or find alternative sources of supply 
with respect to some of cott s key packaging supplies  such as aluminum cans and lids and pet bottles  and some of its key ingredients  such as artificial sweeteners  cott has entered into long term supply agreements  the terms of which range from to years  and therefore cott is assured of a supply of those key packaging supplies and ingredients for a longer period of time 
as with cott s annual supply contracts  cott must either renegotiate these long term supply agreements with the incumbent suppliers when they expire or find alternative sources for supply 
cott relies upon its ongoing relationships with its key suppliers to support its operations 
cott believes that it will be able to either renegotiate contracts with these suppliers when they expire or alternatively  if cott is unable to renegotiate contracts with its key suppliers  cott believes that it could replace them 
however  cott could incur higher ingredient and packaging supply costs in renegotiating contracts with existing suppliers or replacing those suppliers or cott could experience temporary dislocations in its ability to deliver products to its customers  either of which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
commodity prices cott bears the risk of increasing prices on the ingredients and packaging in its products 
the majority of cott s ingredient and packaging supply contracts allow its suppliers to alter the costs they charge cott for those ingredients and packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those ingredients and packaging supplies  such as resin for pet bottles and high fructose corn syrup 
these increases are based on averages of these price increases over various periods of time rather than day to day price fluctuations 
in addition  the contracts for certain of cott s ingredients and packaging supplies permit its suppliers to increase the costs they charge cott based on increases in their cost of converting those underlying commodities into the finished ingredients and packaging supplies that cott purchases 
in certain cases  those increases are subject to negotiated limits and in other cases  they are not 
these changes in the prices that cott pays for ingredients and packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier  but are principally on semi annual and annual bases 
accordingly  cott bears the risk of increases in the costs of these ingredients and packaging supplies  including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these ingredients and packaging supplies and  to some extent  the costs of converting those commodities into finished products 
cott does not use derivatives to manage this risk 
if the cost of these ingredients or packaging supplies increase  cott may be unable to pass these costs along to its customers through corresponding or contemporaneous adjustments to the prices it charges  which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
integration of acquired businesses cott s success depends  in part  on its ability to manage new acquisitions 
in recent years  cott has grown its business and beverage offerings primarily through acquisition of other companies  new product lines and growth with key customers 
a part of cott s strategy is to continue to expand its business through acquisitions and alliances 
to succeed with this strategy  cott must identify appropriate acquisition or strategic alliance candidates 
the success of this strategy also depends on cott s ability to manage and integrate acquisitions and alliances at a pace consistent with the growth of its business 
cott cannot provide assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available  that we will continue to acquire businesses and product lines or that any of the businesses or product lines that we acquire or align with will be integrated successfully into cott s business or prove profitable 
protection of intellectual property cott possesses certain intellectual property that is important to its business 
this intellectual property includes trade secrets  in the form of the concentrate formulae for most of the beverages that cott produces  and trademarks for the names of the beverages that cott sells  which are trademarks cott either owns or licenses from its retailer brand customers and others 
cott s success depends  in part  on its ability to protect its intellectual property 
to protect this intellectual property  cott relies principally on contractual restrictions in agreements such as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and customers  and on common law protections afforded to trade secrets and proprietary know how and the statutory protections afforded to trademarks 
in addition  cott will vigorously pursue any person who infringes on its intellectual property using any and all legal remedies available 
notwithstanding cott s efforts  it may not be successful in protecting its intellectual property for a number of reasons  including cott s competitors may independently develop intellectual property that is similar to or better than cott s  employees  consultants and customers may not abide by their contractual agreements and the cost of enforcing those agreements may be prohibitive  or those agreements may prove to be unenforceable or more limited than anticipated  foreign intellectual property laws may not adequately protect cott s intellectual property rights  and cott s intellectual property rights may be successfully challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
if cott is unable to protect its intellectual property  it would weaken its competitive position and cott could face significant expense to protect or enforce its intellectual property rights 
at january   cott has million of rights recorded as an intangible asset 
foreign exchange cott is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
operations outside of the us account for approximately of sales and of sales and are concentrated principally in the uk and canada 
cott translates the revenues and expenses of its foreign operations using average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
the effect of foreign currency fluctuation has not been material to its results of operations 
cott s debt instruments excluding the uk credit facility are denominated in uk dollars 
to date  cott has not entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
however  cott may enter into foreign exchange contracts in the future if the rates become less stable debt obligations and interest rates cott had a net debt to net debt plus equity ratio of as of january  compared to as of december  and is subject to the risks associated with this level of debt 
cott is exposed to changes in interest rates 
at january   none of its outstanding long term debt is subject to interest at variable rates 
cott regularly reviews the structure of its indebtedness and considers changes to its proportion of floating versus fixed rate debt through refinancing  interest rate swaps or other measures in response to the changing economic environment 
historically  cott has not used derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk 
however  in  cott intends to use derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure to achieve an optimal proportion of floating versus fixed rate debt 
if cott fails to manage these derivative instruments successfully  or if cott is unable to refinance its indebtedness or otherwise increase its debt capacity in response to changes in the marketplace  the expense associated with debt service could increase 
this would negatively impact cott s financial condition 
the information below summarizes cott s market risks associated with debt obligations as of january  the table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by year of maturity 
interest rates disclosed represent the actual weighted average rates as of january  there fair debt maturing in after total value in millions debt fixed rate weighted average interest rate for debt maturing legal matters epa regulations provide that a minimum percentage of a bottler s soft drink sales within specified areas in ontario must be made in refillable containers 
to comply with these requirements  cott and many other industry participants would have to significantly increase sales in refillable containers to a minimum refillable ratio of 
cott is not in compliance with these regulations and does not expect to be in the foreseeable future 
the regulations have not been actively enforced since despite the fact that they are still in effect and not amended 
moreover  the ontario ministry of the environment released a report in stating that these epa regulations are outdated and unworkable 
however  despite the unworkable nature of the epa regulations  they have not yet been revoked 
cott believes that the magnitude of the potential fines that cott could incur if the ontario ministry of the environment chose to enforce these regulations is such that the costs to cott of non compliance could be  although are not contemplated to be  significant 
however  management of cott believes that such enforcement is very remote and  in any event  these regulations are expected to be revoked in the near future given the more recent regulatory activity in this area as described below 
in december of  the ontario ministry of the environment approved the blue box program  which included provisions regarding industry responsibility for of the net cost of the program 
generally  the company that owns the intellectual property rights to the brand of a product  or is the licensee of those rights  and that manufactures  packages or distributes a product for sale in ontario or causes such manufacturing  packaging or distributing of a product in ontario  will be liable for the costs under the program 
cott is not generally the owner of the intellectual property rights to the brands of its products 
rather  cott generally manufactures  packages and distributes products for and on behalf of third party customers who are the brand owners and cott does not believe that any costs for which it might be ultimately responsible for would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations
