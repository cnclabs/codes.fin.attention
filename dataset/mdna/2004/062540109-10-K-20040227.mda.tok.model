the company believes the assumptions underlying its forward looking statements are reasonable 
however  any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and actual results may differ materially from those projected for a variety of reasons  including  but not limited to unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions  the competitive environment  fiscal and monetary policies  or legislation in hawaii and the other markets the company serves  changes in the company s credit quality or risk profile which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for loan and lease losses  changes in market interest rates that may affect the company s credit markets and ability to maintain its net interest margin  changes to the amount and timing of the company s anticipated equity repurchases  inability to achieve expected benefits of the company s business process changes due to adverse changes in implementation processes or costs  operational savings  or timing  real or threatened acts of war or terrorist activity affecting business conditions  and adverse weather and other natural conditions impacting the company and its customers operations 
words such as believes  anticipates  expects  intends  targeted and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements but are not exclusive means of identifying such statements 
the company does not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect later events or circumstances 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the financial services industry it operates 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that require assumptions to be made that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made and where the impact of the selection of the estimate or a change in the estimate from period to period would have a material impact on the financial statements 
based on the potential impact to the financial statements of the valuation methods  estimates  assumptions and judgments used  management identified the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and the valuation of leased asset residuals to be the accounting estimates that are the most subjective and or judgmental 
allowance for loan and lease losses the company maintains an allowance in an amount adequate to cover management s estimate of probable credit losses based on analyses of historical loss experience supplemented by judgmental expectations of the impact of economic conditions as of a given balance sheet date 
the determination of the amount of the allowance is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and significant judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios and deliberation on economic factors and trends 
it is possible that the allowance could have been reduced or increased if the company had judged economic conditions and other factors and risks to be more or less favorable 
see further discussion on allowance in corporate risk profile allowance for loan and lease losses 
mortgage servicing rights valuation when mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained  a servicing asset is established and accounted for based on estimated fair values 
such values are determined using discounted cash flow modeling techniques  which require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  loan repayment rates  costs to service and interest rates that contemplate the risk involved 
because the value of these assets is sensitive to changes in the estimates and assumptions made  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is considered a critical accounting estimate 
had the company assumed that interest rates would decrease and prepayment rates remain at record high levels  then the value of the mortgage servicing rights could have been lower 
note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes further discussion on the accounting for these assets and a sensitivity analysis  is incorporated by reference in this item 
residual valuation of leased assets lease financing receivables include a residual value component  which represents the estimated value of leased assets upon lease expirations 
the valuation of leased assets is considered a critical accounting estimate due to the subjectivity surrounding the future valuation 
the determination of expected value at lease termination is derived from a variety of sources  including equipment valuation services  appraisals and publicly available market data on recent sales transactions on similar equipment 
the length of time until termination and the cyclical nature of equipment values are important variables considered in making this determination 
residual values could have been lower  therefore reducing the value of the recorded leases  if the company had assumed that current uncertainties in the airline industry would continue indefinitely or that there will be a greater incidence of airlines using the bankruptcy process to lower aircraft lease rates or eliminate unused aircraft 
these values could also affect the level of the allowance

non interest income total non interest income in was relatively unchanged from  however  the components of non interest income changed 
service charges  fees and insurance income increased in  while trust and asset management fees and mortgage banking income declined 
table presents the major components of non interest income 
table non interest income year ended december  percent change to dollars in millions trust and asset management mortgage banking service charges on deposit accounts fees  exchange  and other service charges gains on sales of banking operations  net of venture investment losses investment securities gains insurance other income annuity and brokerage income from bank owned life insurance other total other income total non interest income trust and asset management income declined in from due primarily to a decline in the market value of assets under management and lower investment advisory fees on money market assets due to declining short term interest rates 
although the stock market experienced some recovery in  the s p index  a leading market indicator  did not recover to the peak levels of early during  mortgage interest rates declined to near record lows 
as a result  mortgage loan activity was strong with high levels of loan originations  but also high levels of loan prepayments 
because production was higher in than in  sales of newly originated loans and related gains increased in net servicing income declined in compared to due to increased amortization of mortgage servicing rights resulting from the high level of prepayments 
in addition  a million market value gain was recognized in  reversing a december  valuation loss in loans held for sale 
service charges on deposit accounts increased from the prior year  primarily due to a increase in average demand deposits 
in addition  overdraft fees increased from a new fee structure implemented in late account analysis fees increased as a result of customers receiving lower offsetting earnings credits in the lower interest rate environment 
fees  exchange and other service charges increased from  mainly due to a million prepayment fee on a commercial real estate loan in also contributing to the increase were merchant transaction and card fees  a result of increased merchant sales volumes  and home equity and consumer loan fees from marketing campaigns 
the increase in insurance income was mainly due to new business  favorable retention rates  increased premiums and experience adjustments 
annuity and brokerage income declined in due to the overall decline in the industry attributable to the low interest rate environment and uncertainty surrounding the stock market 
income from bank owned life insurance increased in due to additional policies of approximately million that were purchased at the end of other income decreased mainly due to the write off of venture investments of million in compared to a million gain in the decline was also a result of gains on debt repurchases  and an adjustment to the gain on the south pacific sale

largely offsetting the decline in base salaries were increases in incentive compensation and stock based compensation  which increased by million and million  respectively 
incentive compensation increased over the prior year due to the achievement of performance goals in several lines of business and the improvement in the company s overall performance 
the increase in stock based compensation was primarily due to additional restricted stock grants in and the accelerated vesting of grants due to the achievement of targeted company performance goals 
total expense related to restricted stock increased million over s level 
in addition  restricted stock units were awarded in  resulting in million expense 
the decline in salaries  net occupancy and net equipment expense in from was primarily due to the divested businesses

the new system enhances customer service and convenience  as well as improves the company s efficiency 
this seven year outsourcing arrangement is similar to those used by other hawaii banks 
the conversion is expected to provide annual cost savings of approximately million compared to second quarter expense levels 
the following table presents the costs incurred on the systems replacement project 
table professional fees employee termination benefits accelerated depreciation other associated costs total dollars in millions costs incurred total project costs includes contract termination  equipment  excise tax and other costs 
in  restructuring and other related costs were mainly employee and lease termination costs related to the closure of branches in the pacific islands and the completion of the divestitures 
in  restructuring and other related costs were comprised primarily of foreign currency translation losses  the write down of goodwill related to the sale of banking operations  and employee termination costs 
the employee termination costs in related largely to severance for employees of the divested operations and the hawaii based personnel who supported those businesses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item for additional information 
the decrease in professional fees was mainly due to a decline in legal fees and consulting services for the system replacement project  a new payroll system  and compensation plans 
the company also experienced declines in education and advertising expenses and recognized a gain on transfer of an affinity mileage program 
in addition  a million gain on the sale of foreclosed real estate reduced these expenses in income taxes the provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of  compared to effective rates of and in and  respectively 
the unusually high rate in was a result of a higher level of non tax deductible costs associated with the divestitures  the most significant of which was million of goodwill associated with the company s california subsidiary bank

the management accounting process measures the performance of the operating segments based on the management structure of the company and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution 
this process uses various techniques to assign balance sheet and income statement amounts to the business segments  including allocations of overhead  the provision and capital 
this process is dynamic and requires certain allocations based on judgment and subjective factors 
unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management accounting that is equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
results for prior periods have been reclassified to facilitate comparability with the presentation 
the business segments are primarily managed with a focus on performance measures  including risk adjusted return on capital raroc and net income after capital charge niacc 
raroc is the ratio of net income to risk adjusted equity 
equity is allocated to each business segment based on an assessment of its inherent risk 
niacc is net income less a charge for allocated capital 
the cost of capital is determined by multiplying management s estimate of the shareholder s minimum required rate of return on capital invested currently by the segment s allocated equity 
the company assumes a cost of capital that is equal to a risk free rate plus a risk premium of an equity investment in the company 
the net interest income of the business segments reflects the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics and reflects the allocation of net interest income related to the company s overall asset and liability management activities on a proportionate basis 
the basis for the allocation of net interest income is a function of management decisions and assumptions which are subject to change based on changes in current interest rate and market conditions 
the provision charged to the treasury and other corporate segment represents changes in the level of the allowance 
the provision recorded in the retail banking  commercial banking and investment services group segments represents actual net charge offs of these segments 
on a consolidated basis  the company considers niacc a measure of value creation 
for the year ended december   consolidated niacc was a positive million  compared to a negative niacc of million in  a result of improved financial performance and more efficient use of capital 
financial results for each of the segments are presented in table and note of the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item

as of december   of the company s total air transportation outstandings are internally classified 
in the guam portfolio  which is materially dependent on tourism and military spending  economic uncertainty remains 
the local portfolio has performed adequately despite continued economic stress

note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item  describes the methodologies used to develop the allowance 
the allowance was million at december   a decrease of million from december  the ratio of the allowance to loans and leases outstanding was at december  compared with at year end allowance coverage of non accrual loans of at december  increased from in the prior year 
current year allowance coverage of net charge offs of times improved from times in see note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item  for changes in the allowance during the last five years 
net charge offs for of million  or of total average loans  decreased significantly from million  or of total average loans  in current year charge offs included loans of million  primarily consumer  reflecting the remaining balance of the portfolios of the pacific island branches where operations were previously discontinued 
the improvement in net charge offs reflects management s continued execution of portfolio strategies to shift to lower risk industries  reduce large borrower concentrations and selected syndicated national credits  as well as enhanced credit underwriting and collections in the consumer businesses 
in addition  results included an million charge off of a united states air carrier that declared bankruptcy 
due to continued improvements in the company s credit quality and management s assessment of economic conditions and risks  no provision was recorded during  resulting in a reduction of the allowance equal to net charge offs 
while management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories based on methodologies indicated above  the adequacy of the allowance must be considered in its entirety

the allowance is considered adequate by management at december   based on an ongoing analysis of estimated probable credit losses  credit risk profiles  economic conditions  coverage ratios and other relevant factors 
market risk market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
the company is exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting its business activities 
financial products that expose the company to market risk include investment securities  loans  deposits  debt and derivative financial instruments 
the company s market risk management process involves measuring  monitoring  controlling and managing risks that can significantly impact the company s financial position and operating results 
in this management process  market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance and shareholder value  while limiting the volatility of each 
the activities associated with these market risks are categorized into trading and other than trading 
the company s trading activities include foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts that expose the company to a minor degree of foreign currency risk 
these transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers and at times for the company s own account 
the company s other than trading activities include normal business transactions that expose the company s balance sheet profile to varying degrees of market risk 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
a key element in the process of managing market risk involves oversight by senior management and the board of directors as to the level of such risk assumed by the company in its balance sheet 
the board of directors reviews and approves risk management policies  including risk limits and guidelines and delegates oversight functions to the asset liability management committee alco 
the alco  consisting of senior business and finance officers  monitors the company s market risk exposure and as market conditions dictate  modifies balance sheet positions 
the alco may also direct the use of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk the company s balance sheet is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from the company s normal business activities of making loans and taking deposits 
many other factors also affect the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  and historical pricing relationships 
the earnings of the company and its principal subsidiary are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve system 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve system influence to a significant extent the overall growth of loans  investments and deposits  the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities  and interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are often not predictable 
a key element in the company s ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of a net interest income nii monte carlo simulation model 
this model is used to estimate the amount that nii will change over a one year time horizon under various interest rate scenarios 
these estimates are based on assumptions on the behavior of loan and deposit volumes as a function of pricing  prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets  and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments 
the model specification includes embedded optionality 
while such assumptions are inherently uncertain  management believes that these assumptions are reasonable 
as a result  the nii simulation model captures the dynamic nature of the balance sheet and provides a sophisticated estimate rather than a precise prediction of nii s exposure to higher or lower interest rates 
table presents  as of december   and  the estimate of the change in nii from a gradual basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  moving in parallel fashion for the entire yield curve  over the next month period relative to the measured base case scenario for nii 
the resulting estimate in nii exposure was within the approved alco guidelines 
table market risk exposure to interest rate changes december  interest rate change in basis points interest rate change in basis points interest rate change in basis points dollars in millions estimated exposure as a percent of net interest income estimated exposure to net interest income to enhance and complement the results from the nii simulation model  the company also reviews other measures of interest rate risk 
these measures include the sensitivity of market value of equity and the exposure to basis risk and non parallel yield curve shifts 
there are inherent limitations to these measures but used along with the nii simulation model  the company obtains a better overall insight for managing its exposure to changes in interest rates 
in managing interest rate risks  the company uses several approaches to modify its risk position 
approaches that are used to shift balance sheet mix or alter the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities include changing product pricing strategies  modifying investment portfolio characteristics  or using financial derivative instruments 
the use of financial derivatives  as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item  has been limited over the past several years 
liquidity management liquidity is managed in an effort to ensure that the company has continuous access to sufficient  reasonably priced funding 
funding requirements are impacted by loan refinancings and originations  liability settlements and issuances and off balance sheet funding commitments 
the company considers and complies with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitors its liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity 
based on periodic liquidity assessments  the company may alter its assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions 
the company s alco monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change 
this process  combined with the company s ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements  provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk 
in an effort to ensure that its liquidity needs are met  the company actively manages both the asset and liability sides of the statement of condition 
the primary sources of liquidity are available for sale investment securities  interest bearing deposits and cash flows from loans and investments  as well as the ability to sell or securitize certain assets 
with respect to liabilities  liquidity is generated through growth in deposits and other funding 
during  the company continued to use funds generated from the divestiture program to repurchase stock see capital management and reduce debt where possible 
in  million in subordinated notes were redeemed at maturity 
in addition  excess liquidity was deployed into longer term assets 
the company has not utilized off balance sheet financing arrangements as a source of liquidity 
it is not expected that such arrangements will be used significantly in the future 
in  million in privately placed notes mature 
depending on liquidity position at the time of maturity  the payment will be made from cash flow or new borrowings or both 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  are summarized in table see note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item  for additional information on capital and operating lease obligations  note for additional information on short term borrowings  and note for additional information on long term debt

the company issues commercial paper in various denominations with maturities of generally days or less 
during  the company issued commercial paper only in the hawaii marketplace 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase are financing transactions  under which securities are pledged as collateral for short term borrowings 
these transactions are normally with governmental entities 
historically  these governmental entities have provided a stable source of funds 
the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank of seattle the fhlb  which provides an additional source for short and long term funding 
borrowings from the fhlb were million and million at the end of and  respectively 
additionally  the bank maintains a billion senior and subordinated bank note program 
under this facility  the bank may issue additional notes provided that the aggregate amount outstanding does not exceed billion 
subordinated notes outstanding under this bank note program totaled million at december  and the largest purchase obligation included in the above table is the seven year outsourcing agreement with metavante corporation for technology services 
total payments over the remaining term of this contract will be approximately million 
other contracts included in purchase obligations consist of service agreements for the company s asset management system  atm system  and cash management system 
capital management the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures 
these measures were established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy 
at december  and  the company and the bank were well capitalized under this regulatory framework 
there have been no conditions or events since december  that management believes have changed either the company s or the bank s capital classifications 
note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item  provides additional information about the regulatory capital framework and the company s capital amounts and ratios 
as of december   million of capital securities that mature in were outstanding 
these securities qualify as tier i capital for regulatory accounting purposes  but are classified as long term debt in the consolidated statements of condition 
in addition  the company had subordinated debt of million at the end of that qualifies as total capital for regulatory purposes 
at year end  the company s shareholders equity was million  a decrease of million  or  from year end the decline in shareholders equity resulted from stock repurchases that totaled million and dividends paid of million  partially offset by current year earnings and stock issuance under various stock based employee benefit plans 
table presents a five year history of activities and balances in the company s capital accounts  along with key capital ratios 
during  the company s board of directors approved share repurchase programs that authorized the repurchase of an additional million in common stock

fourth quarter results and other matters net income in the fourth quarter of was million  an increase of from net income of million in the fourth quarter of last year 
diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of were  an increase of  or  from per diluted share for the same period last year 
net interest income for the fourth quarter of on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million  an increase of  or million  from the third quarter of  primarily due to higher yields on investment securities 
net interest income increased  or million  from the fourth quarter of as a result of lower interest expense on deposits and a decline in short term borrowings 
the net interest margin was for the fourth quarter of  a basis point increase from in the previous quarter and a basis point increase from in the same quarter last year 
the net interest margin improvement was largely due to lengthening the maturities of certain short term investments  reductions in time deposits and short term borrowings  and debt repurchases  which lowered the company s cost of funds 
the return on average assets for the fourth quarter of improved to from in the comparable period in return on average equity for the fourth quarter of improved to from in the same quarter last year 
due to continued improvements in the company s credit quality and economic conditions  the company did not recognize a provision during the fourth quarter of and has not recognized a provision for the last six quarters 
this resulted in a million reduction in the allowance  which equaled the amount of net charge offs for the fourth quarter 
non interest income was million for the fourth quarter  a decrease of million from the same period in the decrease was largely due to a decline in gains on mortgage loan sales 
non interest expense for the fourth quarter of was million  a decrease of million  or  from the comparable period in non interest expense of million for the fourth quarter of included systems replacement project and net restructuring and other related costs of million 
excluding these items  non interest expenses declined million  or  from the same quarter last year  largely due to savings associated with the systems replacement project
