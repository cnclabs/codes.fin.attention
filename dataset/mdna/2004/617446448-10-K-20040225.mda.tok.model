investment management 
investment management reported net income of million  lower than million in the prior year 
the decline was driven by an decrease in net revenues  reflecting a decline in average assets under management and a less favorable average asset mix 
assets under management at year end were billion  up billion  or  from a year ago primarily as a result of market appreciation 
at year end  the percent of the company s fund assets performing in the top half of the lipper rankings for one year was as compared with a year ago 
investment management also reorganized its business over the past few years  combining four distinct asset management complexes and eliminating money management style redundancies 
investment management will continue to focus on improving investment performance across all asset classes  improving mutual fund flows and consolidating assets with the best performing managers 
investment management will also focus on the pension and separately managed account business by building more alternative investment products and multi disciplinary accounts 
one of investment management s primary challenges is the potential impact that legal and regulatory developments will have on its business  although this potential impact cannot be fully predicted and quantified at this time 
credit services 
credit services net income was million  down from the prior year s record earnings of million 
the current year s results included pre tax severance and facilities closing charges of million 
the decline in earnings was driven by lower non interest revenues and net interest income  which more than offset lower marketing and business development costs

the managed over day delinquency rate increased one basis point to  and the managed over day delinquency rate increased basis points to

total transaction volume rose to a record billion 
during fiscal  credit services faced a difficult credit environment and intense competition 
in response to these challenges  credit services continued to focus on the credit quality of its credit card portfolio  which contributed to a lower level of loan growth 
as a result  the effect of rising losses was magnified by lower receivables and charge offs as a percentage of the portfolio increased 
improving credit quality will continue to be a primary area of management focus

global market and economic conditions in fiscal global market and economic conditions improved during the latter half of fiscal from the difficult conditions that existed during the first half of fiscal and in fiscal fiscal began amid significant investor uncertainty due to concerns about weak global economic conditions and the impact of numerous corporate accounting and governance irregularities that emerged during fiscal in addition  geopolitical tensions escalated in early as military operations in iraq seemed imminent 
however  conditions improved steadily in fiscal the conclusion of major military operations in iraq in the second quarter of fiscal eased geopolitical tensions that existed at the beginning of the year 
in addition  during the latter half of fiscal  most global financial markets rallied in response to positive economic developments  primarily in the us as fiscal concluded  there were increased expectations that the long awaited global economic recovery was beginning to materialize 
in the us  market and economic conditions improved significantly as the year progressed 
during the first half of fiscal  the rate of us economic growth remained weak 
consumer and investor confidence were adversely affected by a relatively high unemployment rate and increased geopolitical concerns  including the mobilization of us military forces in the middle east  and heightened risk aversion that caused us treasury yields to fall significantly 
however  accommodative fiscal and monetary policies contributed to improved economic performance in the latter half of fiscal  including improved business investment and consumer spending  as well as robust growth in productivity 
the rate of unemployment appeared to stabilize  while inflation remained low 
as a result of these improved conditions  us financial markets rallied during the latter half of fiscal during fiscal  the federal reserve board the fed lowered both the overnight lending rate and the discount rate by 
logo in europe  market and economic conditions were generally difficult during most of fiscal at the beginning of the year  geopolitical tensions and the anticipation of a military conflict with iraq contributed to investor uncertainty and weak conditions in the financial markets

during fiscal  the euro appreciated relative to the us dollar  raising concern about price competitiveness of euro exports

business segments 
during fiscal  the company reviewed its segment allocation methodology see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this review resulted in the reallocation of certain revenues  expenses and assets during fiscal among the company s business segments institutional securities  individual investor group  investment management and credit services 
the company believes that the results of these reallocations better reflect the economics of each business segment by representing transactions as if conducted between a segment and an external party 
prior periods have been restated to reflect these segment allocation changes 
while the segment allocation changes had no effect on the company s consolidated net income  they affected the net income of each segment 
as a result of treating these intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties  the company has included an intersegment eliminations category to reconcile the segment results to the company s consolidated results 
the net income in intersegment eliminations represents  among other things  the effect of timing differences associated with the revenue and expense recognition of commissions paid by investment management to individual investor group associated with sales of certain products and the related compensation costs paid to individual investor group s financial advisors 
net income recorded in intersegment eliminations was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the remainder of results of operations is presented on a business segment basis 
substantially all of the operating revenues and operating expenses of the company can be directly attributed to its business segments 
certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment  generally in proportion to their respective revenues or other relevant measures 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior period segment amounts to conform to the current year s presentation

excluding this net benefit  compensation costs increased due to a higher level of net revenues

logo investment banking 
investment banking revenues are derived from the underwriting of securities offerings and fees from advisory services 
investment banking revenues were as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in millions advisory fees from merger  acquisition and restructuring transactions equity underwriting revenues fixed income underwriting revenues total investment banking revenues investment banking revenues decreased in fiscal  reflecting lower revenues from merger  acquisition and restructuring activities  partially offset by higher revenues from fixed income and equity underwriting transactions 
in fiscal  investment banking revenues decreased  reflecting lower revenues from merger  acquisition and restructuring activities and equity and fixed income underwriting transactions 
conditions in the worldwide merger and acquisition markets were difficult throughout most of fiscal  with the fourth quarter of fiscal being the exception 
such conditions included weak corporate earnings as companies began the year focusing on cost reduction instead of expansion 
in addition  the depressed level of fiscal merger and acquisition announcements had a direct impact on completed volumes during fiscal  resulting in reduced advisory revenues 
these conditions improved during the fourth quarter of fiscal  when the global economy demonstrated signs of recovery and the equity markets rallied 
as a result  transaction volume increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal there was trillion of transaction activity announced during calendar year according to thomson financial as compared with trillion in calendar year during calendar year  the company s volume of announced merger and acquisition transactions was approximately billion as compared with approximately billion in the prior year 
the increase primarily resulted from an increase in average transaction size  although volumes were still well below those reported in in fiscal  increased concerns over corporate accounting and governance issues and declining global equity prices had a negative impact on the volume of advisory transactions as both the number of transactions and the average transaction size declined from the prior year period 
the worldwide market for equity underwriting transactions was mixed in fiscal during the first half of fiscal  the uncertainty in the global financial markets continued to adversely affect overall transaction volume 
however  market conditions improved during the latter half of the year 
the volume of fixed income underwritings remained steady throughout much of fiscal  primarily due to a relatively low interest rate environment 
equity underwriting revenues increased in fiscal and decreased in fiscal in the first half of fiscal  equity underwriting revenues increased from relatively depressed levels  primarily led by a high level of convertible offerings 
rising equity markets contributed to a more favorable equity underwriting environment in the second half of fiscal  with a significant increase in global transaction activity  particularly in the technology  financial services and utility sectors 
in fiscal  equity underwriting revenues decreased  reflecting significantly lower volumes of equity offerings in the global equity markets  principally in the us and europe 
the decline in new issue volume reflected the difficult conditions that existed in the global equity markets  including the media and telecommunications sectors 
the decrease in fiscal also was due to lower revenues from underwriting convertible securities 
fixed income underwriting revenues increased in fiscal  primarily reflecting favorable conditions in the global fixed income markets throughout the year 
transaction activity remained steady throughout fiscal as issuers took advantage of the lowest interest rates in nearly years and relatively tight credit spreads 
these conditions contributed to higher revenue from global high yield  investment grade and securitized fixed income transactions 
fixed income underwriting revenues decreased in fiscal  primarily reflecting less logo favorable market conditions  including volatile credit spreads due to an increase in credit risks associated with certain issuers 
these conditions contributed to a lower level of investment grade and structured credit underwriting transactions 
this decrease was partially offset by higher revenues from underwriting municipal fixed income securities 
at the end of fiscal  the backlog of merger  acquisition and restructuring transactions and equity underwriting transactions was higher as compared with the end of the prior year  generally reflecting improved global market and economic conditions 
sales and trading revenues 
sales and trading revenues are composed of principal transaction trading revenues  commissions and net interest revenues 
in assessing the profitability of its sales and trading activities  the company views principal trading  commissions and net interest revenues in the aggregate 
in addition  decisions relating to principal transactions in securities are based on an overall review of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions 
this review includes an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a trade  including any associated commissions  and the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging the company s positions 
the components of the company s sales and trading revenues are described below principal transactions 
principal transaction trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the company acts as principal and gains and losses on the company s positions 
the company also engages in proprietary trading activities for its own account 
commissions 
commission revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and over the counter otc equity securities and options 
in january  the company began implementing a commission based pricing structure for executing transactions on the nasdaq 
prior to january  the company operated its nasdaq equity business through market making activities  which were primarily based on earning a spread between the bid and ask prices  and the results of such market making activities were reported in principal transaction trading revenues 
as a result of the new pricing structure  revenues earned from nasdaq equity trading activities now are included in commission revenues 
net interest 
interest and dividend revenues and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities  including financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased  reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements  trading strategies  customer activity in the company s prime brokerage business  and the prevailing level  term structure and volatility of interest rates 
reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions may be entered into with different customers using the same underlying securities  thereby generating a spread between the interest revenue on the reverse repurchase agreements or securities borrowed transactions and the interest expense on the repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions

toward the end of fiscal  equity sales and trading revenues benefited from rising market indices  increased cash flows into equity mutual funds and higher equity new issue volume 
however  for the full fiscal year  us market volumes and market volatility were generally lower  and commission revenues were impacted by a shift toward electronic trading 
equity sales and trading revenues decreased in fiscal  reflecting lower revenues from cash and derivative equity products due to lower levels of market volatility and lower trading opportunities related to new issue volume  decreased levels of inflows into equity mutual funds and lower revenues from certain proprietary trading activities 
in fiscal  the sluggish global economy and concerns regarding corporate bankruptcies and accounting irregularities contributed to difficult conditions in the equity markets  primarily in the us and europe

the increase was broad based and included higher revenues from the company s credit product  interest rate and currency product  and commodities groups

interest rate and currency product revenues increased  primarily reflecting a generally favorable trading environment  a sharp rise in interest rates in the third quarter of fiscal  higher derivative volumes and increased interest rate volatility in both the us and european markets 
higher revenues from currency products  primarily due to higher market volatility and a declining us dollar  also contributed to the increase 
commodities revenues increased to record levels 
the increase was primarily associated with activities in the energy sector  reflecting higher levels of volatility in certain energy markets  higher customer flow activity and increased trading activity in support of client securitizations 
fixed income sales and trading revenues decreased in fiscal the decrease was due to lower revenues from the company s interest rate and currency product  credit product and commodities groups  each of which had strong results in fiscal the decrease in interest rate and currency product revenues was primarily due to lower revenues from government fixed income securities  partially offset by higher revenues from currency products 
the trading environment for government fixed income securities was difficult during fiscal due to lack of direction with respect to interest rates 
the increase in trading revenues from currency products reflected higher market volatility as the us dollar depreciated against the yen and the euro during much of fiscal the decrease in credit product revenues was primarily due to lower revenues from investment grade fixed income securities  partially offset by higher revenues from global high yield fixed income products 
the decrease in revenues from investment grade fixed income securities reflected a less favorable environment due to an increase in credit risks associated with certain issuers as corporate credit spreads widened due to concerns over corporate bankruptcies  corporate reporting and accounting issues  and credit downgrades 
the increase in revenues from global high yield fixed income products was primarily driven by distressed debt and emerging markets activities  as well as a lower level of markdowns as compared with the prior year 
the decrease in the commodity revenues was primarily attributable to difficult conditions in the energy markets  particularly in the electricity and natural gas sectors 
lower levels of market liquidity and volatility existed during much of fiscal  resulting in fewer trading opportunities 
these conditions reflected increased energy regulation and a decline in the number of active market participants 
in addition to the equity and fixed income sales and trading revenues discussed above  sales and trading revenues include the net interest expense associated with the company s aircraft financing activities  as well as losses associated with the company s corporate lending activities 
in fiscal  sales and trading revenues associated with corporate lending activities increased by approximately million due to lower markdowns as compared with fiscal  reflecting tighter credit spreads as conditions in the credit market improved 
in addition  lower net interest expense associated with aircraft financing activities contributed to the increase 
in fiscal  sales logo and trading revenues associated with these activities decreased and continued to reflect losses in the company s corporate lending activities due to the difficult market conditions that existed during fiscal  including the continued deterioration in the credit markets 
these decreases were slightly offset by lower net interest expense associated with the company s aircraft financing activities 
principal investments 
principal transaction net investment revenue aggregating million was recognized in fiscal as compared with net revenue aggregating million in fiscal both periods results primarily included gains on the company s real estate investments  partially offset by losses in other principal investments 
financial instruments purchased in principal investment transactions generally are held for appreciation and are not readily marketable 
it is not possible to determine when the company will realize the value of such investments since  among other factors  such investments generally are subject to significant sales restrictions

net revenues from the company s aircraft financing business continued to be adversely affected by the slowdown in the commercial aircraft industry that began in in fiscal and fiscal  declining aircraft passenger volume  overcapacity of aircraft and financial difficulties experienced by major airlines contributed significantly to a decline in lease rates for operating lessors  including the company s aircraft financing business

in both periods  the decrease was partially offset by the impact of a new commission based pricing structure for executing transactions on the nasdaq 
in january  the company began implementing a commission based pricing structure for executing transactions on the nasdaq 
prior to january  the company operated its nasdaq equity business through market making activities  which were primarily based on earning a spread between the bid and ask prices  and the results of such market making activities were reported in principal transaction trading revenues 
as a result of the new pricing structure  revenues earned from nasdaq equity trading activities now are included in commission revenues 
the company offers various account options for its individual clients 
for clients who prefer fee based pricing  the company offers the morgan stanley choice sm account  which charges a percentage of assets rather than a per transaction fee 
clients can also choose to have a fee based separately managed account 
as a result  revenues recorded within the commissions and asset management  distribution and administration fees income statement categories are affected by the number of the company s clients electing a fee based pricing arrangement 
net interest 
interest and dividend revenues and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities  including customer margin loans and securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions 
net interest revenues decreased in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in both periods was primarily due to lower net interest revenues from brokerage services provided to individual customers as a result of decreases in the level of margin loans  partially offset by a decline in interest expense due to a decrease in the company s average cost of borrowings

asset management  distribution and administration fees increased marginally in fiscal and increased in fiscal the slight increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to higher fees from investors electing fee based pricing arrangements  including separately managed and morgan stanley choice accounts  reflecting an increase in client assets toward the end of fiscal this increase was offset by lower fees from promoting and distributing mutual funds  reflecting a decrease in individual investors average mutual fund asset levels and a less favorable asset mix that generated lower fees 
the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to higher ics fees  partially offset by lower fees from promoting and distributing mutual funds and lower client asset balances 
in fiscal  client asset balances increased to billion at november  from billion at november  at november   client asset balances were billion 
the increase in client asset balances in fiscal was primarily due to market appreciation  reflecting improvement in the global financial markets during the latter half of fiscal  as well as net new inflows of client assets

the decrease in net income reflected lower net revenues  partially offset by lower non interest expenses 
non interest expenses included a charge of million pre tax associated with workforce reductions and facility consolidations that were conducted during the fourth quarter 
the charge reflected several actions in response to slower industry growth and difficult consumer credit conditions  and consisted of severance related costs of million and space related and other costs of million 
the majority of these costs will be paid by the end of the first quarter of fiscal the fiscal year s results were also adversely affected by record levels of personal bankruptcy filings and a relatively high unemployment rate  both of which peaked during the middle of fiscal in response to these conditions  during fiscal the company reduced marketing expenses and intensified its focus on the credit quality of its credit card loan portfolio  which contributed to the lower level of loan growth

cardmember rewards logo include various reward programs  including the cashback bonus award program  pursuant to which the company pays certain cardmembers a percentage of their purchase amounts based upon a cardmember s level and type of purchases 
merchant and cardmember fees decreased in fiscal and increased in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to a decline in late payment fees and higher cardmember rewards  partially offset by higher merchant discount revenue 
the decline in late payment fees reflected fewer late fee occurrences and higher charge offs of late payment fees 
the increase in cardmember rewards reflected higher cashback bonus costs due to merchant partner programs and record sales volume 
the increase in merchant discount revenue was due to record sales volume and an increase in the average merchant discount rate 
the increase in merchant and cardmember fees in fiscal was due to higher merchant discount revenue associated with increased sales volume  coupled with a slight increase in the average merchant discount rate 
in fiscal  the increase in merchant and cardmember fees also was due to higher late payment fees and lower cardmember rewards incentives  partially offset by lower overlimit and cash advance fees 
late payment fees increased due to the implementation of a tiered fee and the elimination of certain payment features that previously mitigated late charges 
cardmember rewards incentives were lower due to modifications in the cashback bonus program and higher estimated future forfeitures of such rewards  partially offset by higher sales volume 
overlimit fees decreased due to fewer occurrences 
cash advance fees decreased due to lower cash advance transaction volume 
in response to new regulatory guidance on the management of overlimit accounts  the company will suppress the assessment of overlimit fees on accounts that meet specific criteria beginning in fiscal the suppression of overlimit fees will lower merchant and cardmember fee revenue in the future 
servicing fees 
servicing fees are revenues derived from consumer loans that have been sold to investors through asset securitizations and mortgage whole loan sales 
cash flows from the interest yield and cardmember fees generated by securitized general purpose credit card loans and the interest yield generated by securitized mortgage loans are used to pay investors in these loans a predetermined fixed or floating rate of return on their investment  to reimburse investors for losses of principal resulting from charged off loans and to pay the company a fee for servicing the loans 
any excess cash flows remaining are paid to the company 
the servicing fees and excess net cash flows paid to the company are reported as servicing fees in the consolidated statements of income 
the sale of general purpose credit card and mortgage loans through asset securitizations  therefore  has the effect of converting portions of net credit income and fee income to servicing fees 
the company completed credit card asset securitizations of billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal and mortgage loan securitizations of billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal the credit card asset securitization transactions completed in fiscal have expected maturities ranging from approximately two to seven years from the date of issuance

logo servicing fees decreased in fiscal and increased in fiscal the decrease in fiscal reflected higher credit losses associated with a higher level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans and a higher rate of charge offs related to the securitized general purpose credit card loan portfolio 
the decrease was partially offset by higher net interest cash flows and cardmember fees on securitized general purpose credit card loans associated with a higher level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans 
the increase in servicing fees in fiscal was due to a higher level of net interest cash flows driven primarily by the lower interest rate environment 
the increase was partially offset by higher credit losses resulting from a higher rate of charge offs related to the securitized general purpose credit card loan portfolio 
the other revenue component of servicing fees is primarily composed of net securitization gains and losses on general purpose credit card loans and mortgage loans as well as net revenues from mortgage servicing rights on mortgage whole loan sales 
net gains of million  million and million were recorded in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in other revenue in fiscal was attributable to higher levels of general purpose credit card and mortgage loan securitization transactions  offset in part by higher gain amortization related to prior securitization transactions 
the decrease in fiscal was attributable to lower levels of general purpose credit card securitization transactions and modifications to certain assumptions in the gain calculations made during fiscal the assumptions modified by the company in fiscal were the net interest rate spread and the net charge off rate 
the assumed net interest rate spread increased  reflecting the projection of a lower interest rate environment and the resulting lower interest expense ie  cost of funding on variable rate securitizations  partially offset by an estimated lower yield on credit card receivables attributable to estimated lower interest rates and higher charge offs of interest 
the assumed net charge off rate increased  reflecting an increase in the projected charge off rate attributable to weakening economic conditions and its impact on the company s credit card portfolio 
the decrease in fiscal was partially offset by an increase in net securitization gains on mortgage loans and gains on mortgage whole loan sales due to higher levels of mortgage whole loan sales driven by a higher level of mortgage loan originations 
net interest income 
net interest income represents the difference between interest revenue derived from consumer loans and short term investment assets and interest expense incurred to finance those loans and assets 
assets  consisting primarily of consumer loans  currently earn interest revenue at both fixed rates and market indexed variable rates 
the company incurs interest expense at fixed and floating rates 
interest expense also includes the effects of any interest rate contracts entered into by the company as part of its interest rate risk management program 
this program is designed to reduce the volatility of earnings resulting from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the company s right  with notice to cardmembers  to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future 
net interest income decreased in fiscal from the prior year period  as a decline in interest revenue was partially offset by lower interest expense 
the decline in interest revenue was due to a lower yield on general purpose credit card loans and a decrease in average general purpose credit card loans 
the lower yield on general purpose credit card loans was primarily due to lower interest rates offered to new cardmembers and certain existing cardmembers and a higher level of net interest charge offs 
the decrease in average general purpose credit card loans was primarily due to a higher level of securitized loans and higher payments by cardmembers  partially offset by record levels of sales volume 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in the company s average cost of borrowings and a lower level of average interest bearing liabilities 
the company s average cost of borrowings was for fiscal as compared with for fiscal the decline in the average cost of borrowings reflected the fed s aggressive easing of interest rates that began in fiscal and the favorable impact of replacing certain maturing fixed rate debt with lower cost financing  reflecting the lower interest rate environment

a change in the minimum payment requirements may impact future levels of general purpose credit card loans and related interest and fee revenues and charge offs 
provision for consumer loan losses 
the provision for consumer loan losses is the amount necessary to establish the allowance for consumer loan losses at a level that the company believes is adequate to absorb estimated losses in its consumer loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the company s provision for consumer loan losses was  million and  million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company s allowance for consumer loan losses was  million at november  and million at november  the allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio 
the allowance for consumer loan losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio that is evaluated quarterly for adequacy and is established through a charge to the provision for consumer loan losses 
in calculating the allowance for consumer loan losses  the company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach 
the company regularly performs a migration analysis a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses 
the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal  interest and fees reflected in consumer loans 
in addition  the company estimates the losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio based on coverage of a rolling average of historical credit losses 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses  management also considers factors that may impact future credit loss experience  including current economic conditions  recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings  account collection management  policy changes  account seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates and forecasting uncertainties 
a provision for consumer loan losses is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for consumer loan losses at an appropriate level 
logo the provision for consumer loan losses is affected by net principal charge offs  delinquencies  bankruptcy filings and loan growth as well as changes in the amount of consumer loans estimated to be uncollectible 
in fiscal  the provision for consumer loan losses decreased  primarily due to a lower level of average general purpose credit card loans 
in fiscal  the provision for consumer loan losses increased  primarily due to higher net charge off rates 
in response to unfavorable trends in us consumer bankruptcy filings and relatively high unemployment levels  the company recorded a provision for consumer loan losses that exceeded the amount of net consumer loans charged off by approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal delinquencies and charge offs 
general purpose credit card loans are considered delinquent when interest or principal payments become days past due 
general purpose credit card loans are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes days past due  except in the case of bankruptcies  deceased cardmembers and fraudulent transactions  where loans are charged off earlier 
loan delinquencies and charge offs are affected by changes in economic conditions  account collection management and policy changes and may vary throughout the year due to seasonal consumer spending and payment behaviors 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company changed its policy related to deceased cardmember accounts to charge off days after notification as compared with charging off days past due 
this change accelerated charge offs beginning in the third quarter of fiscal and increased charge offs in the second half of fiscal the practice of re aging an account also may affect general purpose credit card loan delinquencies and charge offs 
a re age is intended to assist delinquent cardmembers who have experienced financial difficulties by returning the account to current status 
an account is re aged when the company and the cardmember agree on a temporary repayment schedule  which may include short term concessionary terms  and the cardmember has demonstrated a willingness and ability to repay 
cardmembers may also qualify for a workout re age  which restructures the account to incorporate permanent concessionary terms  when either a longer term or permanent hardship exists 
during the second half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal  the company changed its re age policy in response to industry wide regulatory guidelines 
this change  along with the ongoing economic challenges as evidenced by high levels of unemployment and us bankruptcy filings  have resulted in a significant decrease in the number of cardmembers eligible for re age versus comparable periods in fiscal during fiscal  the company s re age volume decreased by approximately from fiscal the reduction in re age volume was a contributing factor to the higher delinquencies and charge off levels experienced in fiscal in fiscal  net principal charge off rates increased in the managed portfolio as compared with fiscal  reflecting the impact of lower re age volume and the change in the company s deceased cardmember policy discussed above see managed general purpose credit card loan data herein 
in the us  high levels of unemployment  the seasoning of the company s general purpose credit card loan portfolio  a high level of bankruptcy filings and policy changes contributed to the higher net principal charge off rate in the managed portfolio during fiscal in addition  these conditions impacted the company s delinquency rates in both the over and over day categories  which were higher in both the owned and managed portfolio at november  as compared with november  a lower level of general purpose credit card loan balances also negatively impacted delinquency and net principal charge off rates 
in fiscal  net principal charge offs increased in both the owned and managed portfolios as compared with the prior year periods 
despite the increase in net charge off rates  the company s delinquency rates in both the over and over day categories were lower at november  as compared with november   reflecting the company s increased focus on collections in the earlier stages of delinquency 
weak economic conditions and a higher level of bankruptcy filings in the us  coupled with the seasoning of the company s general purpose credit card loan portfolio  contributed to the higher net principal charge off rates during fiscal logo the company s future charge off rates and credit quality are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what has been discussed above 
factors that influence the provision for consumer loan losses include the level and direction of general purpose credit card loan delinquencies and charge offs  changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors  bankruptcy trends  the seasoning of the company s general purpose credit card loan portfolio  interest rate movements and their impact on consumer behavior  and the rate and magnitude of changes in the company s general purpose credit card loan portfolio  including the overall mix of accounts  products and loan balances within the portfolio 
non interest expenses

excluding compensation and benefits expense  non interest expenses decreased 
marketing and business development expense decreased due to lower direct mail costs 
other expenses decreased  primarily reflecting a decrease in certain operating expenses  including lower costs associated with cardmember fraud and merchant bankruptcies 
fiscal s total non interest expenses decreased  primarily due to lower marketing and business development expense  partially offset by increases in professional services and compensation and benefits expense 
compensation and benefits expense increased in fiscal  principally reflecting increases in salaries and benefits 
excluding compensation and benefits expense  non interest expenses decreased 
marketing and business development expense decreased in fiscal due to lower marketing and advertising expense as the company shifted its focus from account growth to credit quality 
professional services expense increased  attributable to higher consulting expenses and increased costs associated with enhanced credit and collection strategies 
seasonal factors 
the credit card lending activities of credit services are affected by seasonal patterns of retail purchasing 
historically  a substantial percentage of general purpose credit card loan growth occurs in the fourth calendar quarter  followed by a flattening or decline of these loans in the following calendar quarter 
merchant fees  therefore  historically have tended to increase in the first fiscal quarter  reflecting higher sales activity in the month of december 
additionally  higher cardmember rewards incentives historically have been accrued for as a reduction of merchant and cardmember fee revenues in the first fiscal quarter  reflecting seasonal growth in retail sales volume 
managed general purpose credit card loan data 
the company analyzes its financial performance on both a managed loan basis and as reported under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap owned loan basis 
managed loan data assume that the company s securitized loan receivables have not been sold and present the results of the securitized loan receivables in the same manner as the company s owned loans 
the company operates its credit services business and analyzes its financial performance on a managed basis 
accordingly  underwriting and servicing standards are comparable for both owned and securitized loans 
the company believes that managed loan information is useful to investors because it provides information regarding the quality of loan origination and credit performance of the entire managed portfolio and allows investors to understand the related credit risks inherent in owned loans and retained interests in securitizations 
in addition  investors often request information on a managed basis  which provides a more meaningful comparison to industry competitors

effective december   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 using the prospective adoption method see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company now records compensation expense based upon the fair value of stock based awards both deferred stock and stock options 
in prior years  the company accounted for its stock based awards under the intrinsic value approach in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the approach in apb and the terms of the company s plans in prior years  the company recognized compensation expense for deferred stock awards in the year of grant  however  no compensation expense was generally recognized for stock option grants 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company completed an extensive analysis of its stock based compensation program and revised elements of its program to further encourage and incent long term performance  enhance employee retention  and better align employee and shareholder interests 
the revisions to fiscal awards included extending the time period over which vesting and non compete provisions apply and raising the eligibility requirements to participate in such awards 
as a result of the revisions to its stock based compensation program  the company will recognize the fair value of stock based awards granted in fiscal over service periods of three and four years  including the year of grant 
historically  the service period for stock based awards was deemed to be the year of grant 
the effect of expensing stock based awards over a longer period of service reduced compensation expense recorded for deferred stock awards by million in fiscal in addition  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company recorded compensation expense of million based on the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal the net impact of these revisions reduced the company s compensation and benefits expense by million in fiscal and increased net income by million or per share in fiscal as compared with fiscal restructuring and other charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recognized restructuring and other charges of million pre tax 
the charge reflected several actions that were intended to resize and refocus certain business areas in order to address the difficult conditions in the global financial markets 
such conditions  including significantly lower levels of investment banking activity and decreased retail investor participation in the equity markets  had an adverse impact on the company s results of operations  particularly in its institutional securities and individual investor group businesses 
the fiscal charge consisted of space related costs of million and severance related costs of million 
the space related costs were attributable to the closure or subletting of excess office space  primarily in the us and the us  as well as the company s decision to consolidate its individual investor group branch locations 
the majority of the space related costs consisted of rental charges and the write off of furniture  fixtures and other fixed assets at the affected office locations 
the severance related costs were attributable to workforce reductions 
the company reduced the number of its employees by approximately  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  primarily in the institutional securities and individual investor group businesses 
the majority of the severance related costs consisted of severance payments provided to the affected individuals 
at november   the remaining liability associated with these charges was approximately million  which was included in other liabilities and accrued expenses in the company s consolidated statement of financial condition 
the majority of the decrease from the original liability of million was due to cash payments of severance related costs made by the company during fiscal the decline in the liability balance during fiscal also reflected net rental payments associated with the office locations referred to logo above 
in fiscal  the liability is expected to decline by an additional million due to the continuing payment of net rentals on these locations 
the liability will continue to be reduced through as these leases expire 
investments in unconsolidated investees 
the company invests in unconsolidated investees that own synthetic fuel production plants 
the company accounts for these investments under the equity method of accounting 
the company s share of the operating losses generated by these investments is recorded within losses from unconsolidated investees  and the tax credits and the tax benefits associated with these operating losses are recorded within the company s provision for income taxes 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded losses from unconsolidated investees of million  million and million  respectively 
these losses were more than offset by tax credits of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and tax benefits on the losses of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
business acquisitions and asset sales 
on november   the company acquired selected components of the us real estate equity advisory businesses of lend lease corporation  an australia based company 
the financial statement impact related to this acquisition  which is included in the company s institutional securities segment  was not significant 
in fiscal  the company sold its self directed online brokerage accounts to bank of montreal s harrisdirect 
the transaction closed during the third quarter of fiscal the company recorded gross proceeds of approximately million included within other revenues and related costs of approximately million included within non interest expenses in the individual investor group segment 
in fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax gain of million related to the sale of a million square foot office tower in new york city that had been under construction since the pre tax gain is included within the institutional securities million  individual investor group million and investment management million segments 
the allocation was based upon occupancy levels originally planned for the building 
in fiscal  the company acquired quilter holdings limited quilter  a uk based private client investment management business providing segregated account management and advisory services to individuals  pension funds and trusts 
the company s fiscal results include the operations of quilter since march   the date of acquisition 
pension plans 
the company made contributions of million and million to its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these contributions were funded with cash from operations and were recorded as a component of prepaid pension benefit cost in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
in addition  the company  in consultation with its independent actuaries  lowered its expected long term rate of return on plan assets from to for fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the impact of this change was not material to the company s consolidated results of operations in fiscal the company determines the amount of its pension contributions by considering the interaction of several factors 
such factors include the range of potential contributions ie  the employee retirement income security act of erisa minimum required contribution up to the maximum tax deductible amount  the level of plan assets relative to plan liabilities  expected plan liquidity needs and expected future contribution requirements 
the company currently has no known or expected erisa minimum funding obligations for any of its pension plans 
in accordance with us gaap  the company recognizes pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees occurs 
as a result  the recording of pension expense involves estimates and assumptions that must be made  including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
logo the assumed discount rate  which reflects the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled  is used in the measurement of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and in the calculation of service cost and interest cost 
the assumed discount rate should reflect the rates of return on available high quality fixed income investments that reflect the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
for its us pension plans  which comprised approximately of the total assets of the company s pension plans at november   the company estimates its discount rate based on the moody s aa long term rate bond yield both absolute levels and year to year changes 
the company uses the expected long term rate of return on plan assets to compute the expected return on assets 
for its us pension plans  the company estimates the expected long term return by utilizing a portfolio return calculator model the portfolio model that produces the expected return for a portfolio 
return assumptions are forward looking gross returns that are not developed solely by an examination of historical returns 
the portfolio model begins with the current us treasury yield curve  recognizing that expected returns on bonds are heavily influenced by the current level of yields 
corporate bond spreads and equity risk premiums  based on current market conditions  are then added to develop the return expectations for each asset class 
expenses that are expected to be paid from the investment return are reflected in the portfolio model as a percentage of plan assets 
this includes investment and transaction fees that typically are paid from plan assets  added to the cost basis or subtracted from sale proceeds  as well as administrative expenses paid from the pension plan 
the company s expected long term rate of return on assets for its us pension plans for fiscal was based on the following expected asset allocation target investment mix expected annual return domestic equity large capitalization small capitalization international equity emerging markets global equity fixed income aggregate high yield for its us pension plans  expected returns are computed using a market related value of assets 
for the market related value of assets  a smoothed actuarial value of assets is used  equal to a moving average of market values in which investment income is recognized over a five year period 
investment income equal to the expected return on the prior year s market related value of plan assets is recognized immediately 
any difference between the actual investment income on a market value basis and the expected return is recognized over a five year period in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
in addition  the market related value of assets must be no greater than and no less than of the market value of assets 
the company amortizes as a component of pension expense unrecognized net gains and losses over the average future service generally to years of active participants to the extent that the gain loss exceeds of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets 
the loss amortization component of fiscal pension expense was approximately million  and future amortization is not expected to have a material impact on the company s pension expense 
logo critical accounting policies 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
fair value 
financial instruments owned of billion at november  and billion at november  and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased of billion at november  and billion at november   which include cash and derivative products  are recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition  and gains and losses are reflected in principal trading revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
fair value is the amount at which financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
the price transparency of the particular product will determine the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
price transparency is affected by a wide variety of factors  including  for example  the type of product  whether it is a new product and not yet established in the marketplace  and the characteristics particular to the transaction 
products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters will generally have a higher degree of price transparency 
by contrast  products that are thinly traded or not quoted will generally have reduced to no price transparency 
even in normally active markets  the price transparency for actively quoted instruments may be reduced for periods of time during periods of market dislocation 
alternatively  in thinly quoted markets  the participation of market makers willing to purchase and sell a product provides a source of transparency for products that otherwise are not actively quoted or during periods of market dislocation 
a substantial percentage of the fair value of the company s financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased is based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or is derived from such prices or parameters 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product 
where available  observable market prices and pricing parameters in a product or a related product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
in certain markets  observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products  and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product 
these techniques involve some degree of judgment 
the company s cash products include securities issued by the us government and its agencies and instrumentalities  other sovereign debt obligations  corporate and other debt securities  corporate equity securities  exchange traded funds and physical commodities 
the fair value of these products is based principally on observable market prices or is derived using observable market parameters 
these products generally do not entail a significant degree of judgment in determining fair value 
examples of products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters include securities issued by the us government and its agencies and instrumentalities  exchange traded corporate equity securities  most municipal debt securities  most corporate debt securities  most high yield debt securities  physical commodities  certain traded loan products and most mortgage backed securities 
by contrast  some cash products exhibit little or no price transparency  and the determination of the fair value requires more judgment 
examples of cash products with little or no price transparency include certain high yield debt  certain collateralized mortgage obligations  certain traded loan products  distressed debt securities ie  securities of issuers encountering financial difficulties  including bankruptcy or insolvency and equity securities that are not publicly traded 
generally  the fair value of these types of cash products is determined using one of several valuation techniques appropriate for the product  which can include cash flow analysis  revenue or net income analysis  default recovery analysis ie  analysis of the likelihood of default and the potential for recovery and other analyses applied consistently 
at november   the fair value of cash products with little or no price transparency recorded in financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet logo purchased was billion and billion  respectively 
at november   the fair value of cash products with little or no price transparency recorded in financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased was billion and billion  respectively 
the company s derivative products include listed and otc derivatives 
listed derivatives have valuation attributes similar to the cash products valued using observable market prices or market parameters described above 
fair values for listed derivatives recorded as financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased amounted to billion and billion  respectively  at november  and billion and billion  respectively  at november  otc derivatives include a wide variety of instruments  such as interest rate swap and option contracts  foreign currency option contracts  credit and equity swap and option contracts  and commodity swap and option contracts 
fair values for otc derivative products recorded as financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased  which amounted to billion and billion  respectively  at november  and billion and billion  respectively  at november   were derived using pricing models 
the fair value of otc derivative contracts is derived primarily using pricing models  which may require multiple market input parameters 
in the absence of observable market prices or parameters in an active market  observable prices or parameters of other comparable current market transactions  or other observable data supporting a fair value based on a pricing model at the inception of a contract  fair value is based on the transaction price 
the company also uses pricing models to manage the risks introduced by otc derivatives 
the term model typically refers to a mathematical calculation methodology based on accepted financial theories 
depending on the product and the terms of the transaction  the fair value of otc derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques  including closed form analytic formulae  such as the black scholes option pricing model  simulation models or a combination thereof  applied consistently 
in the case of more established derivative products  the pricing models used by the company are widely accepted by the financial services industry 
pricing models take into account the contract terms  including the maturity  as well as observable market parameters such as interest rates  volatility and the creditworthiness of the counterparty 
many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity because the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment  and the pricing inputs are observed from actively quoted markets  as is the case for generic interest rate swap and option contracts 
a substantial majority of otc derivative products valued by the company using pricing models falls into this category 
other derivative products  typically the newest and most complex products  will require more judgment in the implementation of the modeling technique applied due to the complexity of the modeling assumptions and the reduced price transparency surrounding the model s market parameters 
the company manages its market exposure for otc derivative products primarily by entering into offsetting derivative contracts or related financial instruments 
the company s trading divisions  the controllers department and the market risk department continuously monitor the price changes of the otc derivatives in relation to the hedges 
for a further discussion of the price transparency of the company s otc derivative products  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management credit risk in part ii  item a 
the company employs control processes to validate the fair value of its financial instruments  including those derived from pricing models 
these control processes are designed to assure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable market prices or market based parameters wherever possible 
in the event that market prices or parameters are not available  the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and the assumptions are reasonable 
these control processes include reviews of the pricing model s theoretical soundness and appropriateness by company personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks 
additionally  groups independent from the trading divisions within the controllers and market risk departments participate in the review and validation of the fair values generated from pricing models  as appropriate 
where a pricing model is used to determine fair value  recently executed comparable transactions are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model 
consistent with market practice  the company has individually negotiated agreements with certain counterparties to exchange collateral margining based on the level of fair values of the derivative contracts they have executed 
logo through this margining process  one party or both parties to a derivative contract provides the other party with information about the fair value of the derivative contract to calculate the amount of collateral required 
this sharing of fair value information provides additional support of the company s recorded fair value for the relevant otc derivative products 
for certain otc derivative products  the company  along with other market participants  contributes derivative pricing information to aggregation services that synthesize the data and make it accessible to subscribers 
this information is then used to evaluate the fair value of these otc derivative products

transfers of financial assets 
the company engages in securitization activities in connection with certain of its businesses 
gains and losses from securitizations are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the company relinquishes control of the transferred financial assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
 and other related pronouncements 
the gain or loss on the sale of financial assets depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of sale 
in connection with its institutional securities business  the company engages in securitization transactions to facilitate client needs and as a means of selling financial assets 
the company recognizes any interests in the transferred assets and any liabilities incurred in securitization transactions in its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value 
subsequently  changes in the fair value of such interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
in connection with its credit services business  the company periodically sells consumer loans through asset securitizations and continues to service these loans 
the present value of the future net servicing revenues that the company estimates it will receive over the term of the securitized loans is recognized in income as the loans are securitized 
a corresponding asset also is recorded and then amortized as a charge to income over the term of the securitized loans 
the securitization gain or loss involves the company s best estimates of key assumptions  including forecasted credit losses  payment rates  forward yield curves and appropriate discount rates 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different financial results 
allowance for consumer loan losses 
the allowance for consumer loan losses in the company s credit services business is established through a charge to the provision for consumer loan losses 
provisions are made to reserve for estimated losses in outstanding loan balances 
the allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio 
the allowance for consumer loan losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio that is evaluated quarterly for adequacy 
in calculating the allowance for consumer loan losses  the company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach 
the company regularly performs a migration analysis a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses 
the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal  interest and fees reflected in consumer loans 
in addition  the company estimates the losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio based on coverage of a rolling average of historical credit losses 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses  management also considers factors that may impact future credit loss experience  including current economic conditions  recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings  account collection management  policy changes  account seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates and forecasting uncertainties 
a provision for consumer loan losses is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for consumer loan losses at an appropriate level 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for consumer loan losses see credit services provision for consumer loan losses herein 
logo aircraft under operating leases 
aircraft under operating leases are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the aircraft asset  which is generally years from the date of manufacture 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which the company adopted on december   the company s aircraft are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the aircraft may not be recoverable 
under sfas no 
 the carrying value of an aircraft may not be recoverable if its projected undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value 
if an aircraft s projected undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value  the company will recognize an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the aircraft 
the fair value of the company s impaired aircraft is based upon valuation information obtained from independent appraisal companies 
estimates of future cash flows associated with the aircraft assets as well as the appraisals of fair value are critical to the determination of whether an impairment exists and the amount of the impairment charge  if any see note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain factors affecting results of operations 
the company s results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic factors 
in addition  results of operations in the past have been  and in the future may continue to be  materially affected by many factors of a global nature  including political  economic and market conditions  the availability and cost of capital  the level and volatility of equity prices  commodity prices and interest rates  currency values and other market indices  technological changes and events  the availability and cost of credit  inflation  and investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets 
in addition  there has been a heightened level of legislative  legal and regulatory developments related to the financial services industry that potentially could increase costs  thereby affecting future results of operations 
such factors also may have an impact on the company s ability to achieve its strategic objectives on a global basis 
the company s institutional securities business  particularly its involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products  including derivatives  is subject to substantial positive and negative fluctuations due to a variety of factors that the company cannot control or predict with great certainty  including variations in the fair value of securities and other financial products and the volatility and liquidity of global trading markets 
fluctuations also occur due to the level of global market activity  which  among other things  affects the size  number  and timing of investment banking client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from the company s principal investments 
such factors also affect the level of individual investor participation in the financial markets  which impacts the results of the individual investor group 
the level of global market activity also could impact the flow of investment capital into or from assets under management and supervision and the way in which such capital is allocated among money market  equity  fixed income or other investment alternatives  which could cause fluctuations to occur in the company s investment management business 
in the company s credit services business  changes in economic variables  such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings  the rate of unemployment  and the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt  may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit quality  which  in turn  could impact the results of credit services 
the company s results of operations also may be materially affected by competitive factors 
included among the principal competitive factors affecting the institutional securities and individual investor group businesses are the company s reputation  the quality of its personnel  its products  services and advice  capital commitments  relative pricing and innovation 
competition in the company s investment management business is affected by a number of factors  including the company s reputation  investment objectives  quality of investment professionals  relative performance of investment products  advertising and sales promotion efforts  fee levels  distribution channels  and types and quality of services offered 
in the credit services business  competition centers on merchant acceptance of credit cards  account acquisition and customer utilization of credit cards  all of which are impacted by the types of fees  interest rates and other features offered 
logo the company strives to increase market share in all of its businesses and evaluates the competitive position of its businesses by  among other things  monitoring various market share data 
for example  in the institutional securities investment banking business  the company monitors its market share in key areas such as announced and completed worldwide mergers and acquisitions  worldwide equity underwritings and worldwide investment grade debt underwritings 
in the institutional securities sales and trading business  the company monitors its market share via independent client surveys as well as its market share of global exchange and non exchange volumes 
in the individual investor group business  the company monitors its market share of client assets and the number of financial advisors 
in the investment management business  the company monitors its market share of assets under management or supervision and mutual fund flows among mutual fund managers 
it also monitors the relative performance of its funds as determined by organizations such as morningstar and lipper 
in the credit services business  the company monitors its ranking in the number of merchant and cash access locations  the level of general purpose credit card loan balances outstanding  transaction volume and the credit quality of its loan portfolio 
besides competition from firms traditionally engaged in the financial services business  competition exists from other sources  such as commercial banks  insurance companies  sponsors of mutual funds and other companies offering financial services in the us  globally and through the internet 
the financial services industry has experienced consolidation and convergence  as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services industries have merged 
such convergence has continued and could result in the company s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources  such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity 
in addition  the company has experienced competition for qualified employees 
the company s ability to sustain or improve its competitive position will substantially depend on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees while managing compensation costs 
as a result of the above economic and competitive factors  net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of full year results and may vary significantly from year to year and from quarter to quarter 
the company intends to manage its business for the long term and to mitigate the potential effects of market downturns by strengthening its competitive position in the global financial services industry through diversification of its revenue sources  enhancement of its global franchise  and management of costs and its capital structure 
the company s overall financial results will continue to be affected by its ability and success in addressing client goals  maintaining high levels of profitable business activities  emphasizing fee based products that are designed to generate a continuing stream of revenues  evaluating product pricing  managing risks  costs and its capital position  and maintaining its strong reputation and franchise 
in addition  the complementary trends in the financial services industry of consolidation and globalization present  among other things  technological  risk management and other infrastructure challenges that will require effective resource allocation in order for the company to remain competitive 
logo liquidity and capital resources 
the company s senior management establishes the overall liquidity and capital policies of the company 
through various risk and control committees  the company s senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies  monitors the availability of sources of financing  and oversees the liquidity and interest rate and currency sensitivity of the company s asset and liability position 
these committees  along with the company s treasury department and other control groups  also assist in evaluating  monitoring and controlling the impact that the company s business activities have on its consolidated balance sheet  liquidity and capital structure  thereby helping to ensure that its business activities are integrated with the company s liquidity and capital policies 
for a description of the company s other principal risks and how they are monitored and managed  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management in part ii  item a 
the balance sheet 
the company s total assets increased to billion at november  from billion at november  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in financial instruments owned  largely driven by corporate and other debt inventories and increases in the value of derivatives 
growth in equity financing activities  including securities borrowed and receivables from customers  also contributed to the increase 
a substantial portion of the company s total assets consists of highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from its institutional securities sales and trading activities 
the highly liquid nature of these assets provides the company with flexibility in financing and managing its business 
balance sheet leverage ratios are one indicator of capital adequacy when viewed in the context of a company s overall liquidity and capital policies 
the company views the adjusted leverage ratio as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services firms and evaluating leverage trends 
this ratio is adjusted to reflect the low risk nature of assets attributable to matched reverse repurchase agreements  certain securities borrowed transactions and segregated customer cash balances 
in addition  the adjusted leverage ratio reflects the deduction from shareholders equity of the amount of equity used to support goodwill  as the company does not view this amount of equity as available to support its risk capital needs 
the following table sets forth the company s total assets  adjusted assets  leverage ratios and book value per share at november  dollars in millions  except ratio and per share data total assets less lesser of securities purchased under agreements to resell or securities sold under agreements to repurchase assets recorded under certain provisions of sfas no 
and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin lesser of securities borrowed or securities loaned segregated customer cash and securities balances goodwill adjusted assets shareholders equity preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption subtotal less goodwill tangible shareholders equity leverage ratio x x adjusted leverage ratio x x book value per share logo leverage ratio equals total assets divided by tangible shareholders equity 
adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible shareholders equity 
book value per share equals shareholders equity divided by common shares outstanding of  million at november  and  million at november  equity capital management policies 
the company s senior management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength and  therefore  pursues a strategy of ensuring that the company s equity base adequately reflects and provides some protection from the economic risks inherent in its businesses 
capital is required for  among other things  the company s securities inventories  underwritings  principal investments  private equity activities  consumer loans  bridge loans and other financings  and investments in fixed assets  including aircraft assets 
the company also considers return on common equity to be an important measure of its performance  in the context of both the particular business environment in which the company is operating and its peer group s results 
in this regard  the company actively manages its consolidated equity capital position based upon  among other things  business opportunities  capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies  regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and  therefore  in the future may expand or contract its equity capital base to address the changing needs of its businesses 
the company attempts to maintain total equity  on a consolidated basis  at least equal to the sum of its operating subsidiaries equity 
at november   the company s equity capital which includes shareholders equity and preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption was billion  an increase of billion from november  the company returns internally generated equity capital that is in excess of the needs of its businesses to its shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends 
the board of directors has authorized the company to purchase  subject to market conditions and certain other factors  shares of common stock for capital management purposes 
the unused portion of this authorization at january  was approximately million 
the company also has an ongoing repurchase authorization in connection with awards granted under its equity based compensation plans 
the board of directors determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis 
in december  the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend per common share by to 
liquidity management policies 
the primary goal of the company s funding and liquidity activities is to ensure adequate financing over a wide range of potential credit ratings and market environments 
given the highly liquid nature of the company s balance sheet  day to day funding requirements are largely fulfilled through the use of collateralized financing 
in order to meet target liquidity requirements and withstand an unforeseen contraction in credit availability  the company has designed a liquidity management framework 
this framework is intended to ensure that the company maintains sufficient liquidity to continue to fund its ongoing business and to meet all of its financial obligations maturing within a one year period without issuing any new unsecured debt 
liquidity management framework designed to cash capital policy ensure that the company can fund its balance sheet while repaying its financial obligations maturing within one year without issuing new unsecured debt 
the company attempts to achieve this by maintaining sufficient cash capital long term debt and equity capital to finance illiquid assets and the portion of its securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment 
liquidity reserve maintain  at all times  a liquidity reserve in the form of immediately available cash and cash equivalents to cover volatility in day to day funding needs 
the reserve is periodically assessed and determined based on funding volatility and liquidity targets and averaged approximately billion during fiscal contingency planning maintain the company s contingency funding plan to ascertain the company s ability to manage a prolonged liquidity contraction and provide a course of action over a one year time period to ensure orderly functioning of the company s businesses 
the company s contingency funding plan sets forth the process and the internal and external communication flows necessary to ensure effective management of the contingency event 
logo the company also pursues a strategy of diversification of funding sources by products and markets and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the company s liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed 
maturities of financings are designed to manage exposure to refinancing risk in any one period 
the company maintains a surplus of unused short term funding sources at all times to withstand any unforeseen contraction in credit capacity 
in addition  the company attempts to maintain cash and unhypothecated marketable securities equal to at least of its outstanding short term unsecured borrowings 
the company also maintains committed credit facilities described below to support its ongoing borrowing programs 
the level of the company s borrowings is continually adjusted to maintain the target cash liquidity reserve after meeting the company s daily funding requirements 
the company s funding requirements will vary based on changes in the level and composition of its balance sheet  timing of specific transactions  client financing activity  market conditions and seasonal factors 
funding management policies 
the company funds its balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources 
these sources include the company s equity capital  long term debt  repurchase agreements  us  canadian  euro  japanese and australian commercial paper  asset backed securitizations  letters of credit  unsecured bond borrowings  securities lending  buy sell agreements  municipal reinvestments  promissory notes  master notes  and committed and uncommitted lines of credit 
repurchase agreement transactions  securities lending and a portion of the company s bank borrowings are made on a collateralized basis and  therefore  provide a more stable source of funding than short term unsecured borrowings 
the company s bank subsidiaries solicit deposits from consumers  purchase federal funds  issue short term institutional certificates of deposits and issue bank notes 
interest bearing deposits are classified by type as savings  brokered and other time deposits 
savings deposits consist primarily of money market deposit accounts sold nationally and savings deposits from individual securities clients 
brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposits issued by the company s bank subsidiaries 
other time deposits include individual and institutional certificates of deposits 
unsecured debt and borrowings 
the company views long term debt as a stable source of funding for core inventories  consumer loans and illiquid assets 
in general  securities inventories not financed by secured funding sources and the majority of current assets are financed with a combination of short term funding  floating rate long term debt or fixed rate long term debt swapped to a floating rate 
fixed assets are financed with fixed rate long term debt 
both fixed rate and floating rate long term debt in addition to sources of funds accessed directly by the company s credit services business are used to finance the company s consumer loan portfolio 
consumer loan financing is targeted to match the repricing and duration characteristics of the loans financed 
the company uses derivative products primarily interest rate  currency and equity swaps to assist in asset and liability management  reduce borrowing costs and hedge interest rate risk see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company issues long term debt in excess of the amount necessary to meet the needs of its securities inventory and less liquid assets as determined by its cash capital policy 
in addition to these needs  long term debt funding is employed to enhance the company s liquidity position by reducing reliance on short term credit sensitive instruments eg  commercial paper and other unsecured short term borrowings 
availability and cost of financing to the company can vary depending on market conditions  the volume of certain trading and lending activities  the company s credit ratings and the overall availability of credit 
during fiscal  the company s long term financing strategy was driven  in part  by its continued focus on improved balance sheet strength evaluated through enhanced capital and liquidity positions  a significant factor in the maintenance of strong credit ratings 
as a result  for fiscal  approximately billion of unsecured logo debt was issued excluding certain equity and credit linked products not considered to be a component of the company s cash capital with over of these transactions having a maturity of five years or longer 
financing transactions were structured to ensure staggered maturities  thereby mitigating refinancing risk  while a diversified investor base was targeted through sales to domestic as well as international institutional and retail clients 
unsecured debt issuance activity resulted in a net increase in the long term debt component of the cash capital portfolio of approximately billion and a corresponding billion reduction in the level of short term commercial paper outstanding at fiscal year end 
the company s total capital base primarily consists of equity capital combined with long term borrowings debt obligations scheduled to mature in more than months and preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption 
at november   total capital was billion  an increase of billion from november  the company maintains borrowing relationships with a broad range of banks  financial institutions  counterparties and others from which it draws funds in a variety of currencies 
the company values committed credit as a significant component of its liquidity policy

credit ratings 
the company s reliance on external sources to finance a significant portion of its day to day operations makes access to global sources of financing important 
the cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are dependent on the company s short term and long term credit ratings 
factors that are significant to the determination of the company s credit ratings or otherwise affect the ability of the company to raise short term and long term financing include its level and volatility of earnings  relative positions in the markets in which it operates  global and product diversification  risk management policies  cash liquidity and capital structure 
in addition  the agencies that rate the company s debt have focused on changes in the market that may require financial services firms to assume more credit risk in connection with their corporate lending activities and recent legal and regulatory developments 
a deterioration in any of the previously mentioned factors or combination of these factors may lead rating agencies to downgrade the credit ratings of the company  thereby increasing the cost to the company in obtaining unsecured financings 
in addition  the company s debt ratings can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues  particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical  such as otc derivative transactions  including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps 
in connection with certain otc trading agreements associated with the institutional securities business  the company would be required to provide additional collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade by either standard poor s or moody s investors service 
at november   the amount of additional collateral that would be required in the event of a one notch downgrade of the company s senior debt credit rating was approximately million

off balance sheet arrangements 
the company enters into various arrangements with unconsolidated entities  including variable interest entities  primarily in connection with its institutional securities and credit services businesses 
institutional securities activities 
the company utilizes special purpose entities spes primarily in connection with securitization activities 
the company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans  corporate bonds and loans  us agency collateralized mortgage obligations  municipal bonds  and other types of financial assets 
the company may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization 
these retained interests are included in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value 
any changes in the fair value of such retained interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
retained interests in securitized financial assets associated with the company s institutional securities business were approximately billion at november   the majority of which were related to us agency collateralized mortgage obligation  commercial mortgage loan and residential mortgage loan securitization transactions 
for further information about the company s institutional securities securitization activities  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about variable interest entities  the company s arrangements with these entities and its adoption of fin the company has entered into liquidity facilities with spes and other counterparties whereby the company is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur 
the company often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the spes in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
credit services activities 
the asset securitization market is a significant source of funding for the company s credit services business 
by utilizing this market  the company further diversifies its funding sources  realizes cost effective funding and reduces reliance on the company s other funding sources  including unsecured debt 
the securitization transaction structures utilized for the credit services business are accounted for as sales  ie  off balance sheet transactions in accordance with ie gaap see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with its credit card securitization program  the company transfers credit card receivables  on a revolving basis  to the trusts  which issue asset backed securities that are registered with the securities and exchange commission the sec  are used to support the issuance of publicly listed notes or are privately placed 
this structure includes certain features designed to protect the investors that could result in earlier than expected amortization of the transactions  potentially resulting in the need for the company to obtain alternative funding arrangements 
the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements economic early amortization 
logo economic early amortization risk reflects the possibility of negative net securitization cash flows which would occur if the coupon  contractual servicing fee and net charge offs exceeded the collections of finance charges and cardmember fees on securitized credit card receivables and is driven primarily by the trusts credit card receivables performance in particular  receivables yield  cardmember fees and credit losses incurred as well as the contractual rate of return of the asset backed securities 
in the event of an economic early amortization  receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trusts from the company would instead continue to be recognized on the company s consolidated statements of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trusts would instead be used to repay investors in the asset backed securities 
these recognized receivables would require the company to obtain alternative funding 
although the company believes that the combination of factors that would result in an economic early amortization event is remote  the company also believes its access to alternative funding sources would mitigate this potential liquidity risk 
a group of banks are committed to provide up to billion under a credit facility that supports the short term extendible asset backed certificate program issued by the discover card master trust i 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 
in connection with its operating activities  the company enters into certain contractual obligations  as well as commitments to fund certain fixed assets and other less liquid investments

this amount represents the company s outstanding letters of credit  which are primarily used to satisfy various collateral requirements 
this amount represents the company s commitments in connection with its private equity and other principal investment activities 
logo the company s investment grade and non investment grade lending commitments are made in connection with its corporate lending activities 
see less liquid assets lending activities herein 
this amount represents lending commitments extended by the company to companies that are secured by assets of the borrower 
loans made under these arrangements typically are at variable rates and generally provide for over collateralization based upon the creditworthiness of the borrower 
credit ratings are determined by the company s credit department  using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies 
credit ratings of bb or lower are considered non investment grade 
the table above does not include commitments to extend credit for consumer loans of approximately billion 
such commitments arise primarily from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards  provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement 
these commitments  substantially all of which the company can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  the company guarantees the debt and or certain trading obligations including obligations associated with derivatives  foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities of certain subsidiaries 
these guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties 
the activities of the subsidiaries covered by these guarantees including any related debt or trading obligations are included in the company s consolidated financial statements

high yield instruments 
in connection with the company s fixed income securities activities  the company underwrites  trades  invests and makes markets in non investment grade instruments high yield instruments 
for purposes of this discussion  high yield instruments are defined as fixed income  emerging market  preferred equity securities and distressed debt rated bb or lower or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating agencies as well as non rated securities which  in the opinion of the company  contain credit risks associated with non investment grade instruments 
for purposes of this discussion  positions associated with the company s credit derivatives business are not included because reporting gross market value exposures would not accurately reflect the risks associated with these positions due to the manner in which they are risk managed 
high yield instruments generally involve greater risk than investment grade securities due to the lower credit ratings of the issuers  which typically have relatively high levels of indebtedness and  therefore  are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions 
in addition  the market for high yield instruments can be characterized by periods of volatility and illiquidity 
the company monitors total inventory positions and risk concentrations for high yield instruments in a manner consistent with the company s market risk management policies and control structure 
the company manages its aggregate and single issuer net exposure through the use of derivatives and other financial instruments 
the company records high yield instruments at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses are recognized currently in the company s consolidated statements of income

effects of inflation and changes in foreign exchange rates 
because the company s assets to a large extent are liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  inflation may result in increases in the company s expenses  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  upon the value of financial instruments and upon the markets for consumer credit services  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and profitability 
a significant portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of us dollar net assets  revenues and expenses 
potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored  and  where cost justified  strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the company s financial performance 
these strategies may include the financing of non us dollar assets with direct or swap based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets  revenues  expenses or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management 
risk management policy and control structure 
risk is an inherent part of the company s business and activities 
the extent to which the company properly and effectively identifies  assesses  monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its activities is critical to its soundness and profitability 
the company s broad based portfolio of business activities helps reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its net revenues as a whole 
the company seeks to identify  assess  monitor and manage  in accordance with defined policies and procedures  the following principal risks involved in the company s business activities market risk  credit risk  operational risk  legal risk and funding risk 
funding risk is discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in part ii  item the company s currency exposure relating to its net monetary investments in non us dollar functional currency subsidiaries is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
risk management at the company is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication  judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets 
the company s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the global financial services business  the company s risk management policies  procedures and methodologies are evolutionary in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
the management committee  composed of the company s most senior officers  establishes the company s overall risk management policies and reviews its performance relative to these policies 
the management committee has authorized the securities risk committee to assist in monitoring and reviewing the risk management practices of the company s institutional securities business 
the securities risk committee has created subcommittees that report on specific risk management matters associated with the institutional securities business 
in addition  the company s other business areas have established committees to manage and monitor specific risks 
these committees and subcommittees review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to the company s market and credit risk profile  sales practices  pricing of consumer loans and reserve adequacy  reputation  legal enforceability  and operational and technology risks 
representation on these committees by senior management of both the business units and the relevant independent control functions helps ensure that risk policies and procedures  exceptions to risk limits  new products and business ventures  and transactions with risk elements undergo a thorough review 
the market risk  credit  controllers  treasury  and law departments collectively  the control groups  which are all independent of the company s business units  assist senior management and the risk committees in monitoring and controlling the company s risk profile 
the market risk and credit departments have operational responsibility for measuring and monitoring aggregate market and credit risk  respectively  with respect to the company s institutional trading activities and are responsible for risk policy development  risk analysis and risk reporting to senior management and the risk committees 
in addition  the internal audit department  which reports to senior management and the company s audit committee  periodically examines and evaluates the company s operations and control environment 
the company is committed to employing qualified personnel with appropriate expertise in each of its various administrative and business areas to implement effectively the company s risk management and monitoring systems and processes 
the following is a discussion of the company s risk management policies and procedures for its principal risks other than funding risk 
the discussion focuses on the company s securities trading primarily its institutional trading activities and consumer lending and related activities 
the company believes that these activities generate a substantial portion of its principal risks 
this discussion and the estimated amounts of the company s logo market risk exposure generated by the company s statistical analyses are forward looking statements 
however  the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events  and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which the company operates and certain other factors described below 
market risk 
market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  rates  indices  implied volatilities the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a position or portfolio 
sound market risk management is an integral part of the company s culture 
the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well managed and prudent 
the control groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management 
a variety of limits are designed to control price and liquidity risk 
market risk is monitored through various measures statistically using value at risk var and related analytical measures  by measures of position sensitivity  and through routine stress testing and scenario analysis conducted by the market risk department in collaboration with the business units 
the material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the market risk department that are circulated to  and discussed with  senior management 
sales and trading and related activities 
primary market risk exposures and market risk management 
during fiscal  the company had exposures to a wide range of interest rates  equity prices  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices and associated implied volatilities and spreads related to the global markets in which it conducts its trading activities 
the company is exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of its market making activities and proprietary trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments eg  risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates  the timing of mortgage prepayments  the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads 
the company is exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining proprietary positions 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency options and from maintaining foreign exchange positions 
the company is exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market making activities and maintaining positions in physical commodities such as crude and refined oil products  natural gas  electricity  and precious and base metals and related derivatives 
the company manages its trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies 
these strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging through the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments  including a variety of derivative products eg  futures  forwards  swaps and options 
the company manages the market risk associated with its trading activities on a company wide basis  on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis 
the company manages and monitors its market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that the company believes is well diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects the company s aggregate risk tolerance as established by the company s senior management 
aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the company and for its major trading divisions worldwide equity and fixed income  which includes interest rate products  credit products  foreign exchange and commodities 
additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and  as appropriate  products and regions 
trading division risk managers  desk risk managers  traders and the market risk department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by senior management 
logo the market risk department independently reviews the company s trading portfolios on a regular basis from a market risk perspective utilizing var and other quantitative and qualitative risk measures and analyses 
the company s trading businesses and the market risk department also use  as appropriate  measures such as sensitivity to changes in interest rates  prices  implied volatilities and time decay to monitor and report market risk exposures 
stress testing  which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors for certain products  is performed periodically and is reviewed by trading division risk managers  desk risk managers and the market risk department 
the market risk department also conducts scenario analysis  which estimates the company s revenue sensitivity to a series of specific predefined market and geopolitical events 
reports summarizing material risk exposures are produced by the market risk department and are disseminated to senior management  including the management committee and the securities risk committee 
value at risk var 
the company uses the statistical technique known as var as one of the tools used to measure  monitor and review the market risk exposures of its trading portfolios 
the market risk department calculates and distributes daily var based risk measures to various levels of management 
var methodology  assumptions and limitations 
the company estimates var using a model based on historical simulation for major market risk factors and monte carlo simulation for name specific risk in certain equity and fixed income exposures 
historical simulation involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on two sets of inputs historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market factors market risk factors  and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes 
the company s var model uses approximately four years of historical data to characterize potential changes in market risk factors 
the company s one day var corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that  based on historically observed market risk factor movements  would have been exceeded with a frequency of  or once in every trading days if the portfolio was held constant for one day 
the company s var model generally takes into account linear and non linear exposures to price risk and linear exposures to implied volatility risks 
market risks that are incorporated in the var model include equity and commodity prices  interest rates  foreign exchange rates and associated implied volatilities 
as a supplement to the use of historical simulation for major market risk factors  the company s var model uses monte carlo simulation to capture name specific risk in equities and credit products ie  corporate bonds and credit derivatives 
the company s var models evolve over time in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities 
as part of regular process improvement  additional systematic and name specific risk factors may be added to improve the var model s ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors 
among their benefits  var models permit estimation of a portfolio s aggregate market risk exposure  incorporating a range of varied market risks  reflect risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities  and can cover a wide range of portfolio assets 
however  var risk measures should be interpreted carefully in light of the methodology s limitations  which include the following past changes in market risk factors may not always yield accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements  changes in portfolio value in response to market movements especially for complex derivative portfolios may differ from the responses calculated by a var model  var using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day  the historical market risk factor data used for var estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under market conditions that are unusual relative to the historical period used in estimating the var  and published var results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions 
the company logo is aware of these and other limitations and  therefore  uses var as only one component in its risk management oversight process 
as explained above  this process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analysis and extensive risk monitoring  analysis  and control at the trading desk  division and company levels 
var for fiscal the table below presents the company s var for each of the company s primary market risk exposures and on an aggregate basis at november  and november   incorporating substantially all financial instruments generating market risk that are managed by the company s trading businesses 
this measure of var incorporates most of the company s trading related market risks 
however  a small proportion of trading positions generating market risk is not included in var eg  certain credit default baskets  and the modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies upon approximations that  under certain circumstances  could produce significantly different var results from those produced using more precise measures 
for example  risks associated with residential mortgage backed securities have been approximated as it is difficult to capture precisely these risks within a var context 
aggregate var also incorporates a the funding liabilities related to trading positions and b public company equity positions recorded as principal investments by the company 
principal investments made by the company that are not publicly traded are not reflected in the var results reported below 
as of november   the aggregate carrying value of such investments was approximately million 
since var statistics reported below are estimates based on historical position and market data  var should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future revenues or financial performance or its ability to monitor and manage risk 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the var amounts indicated below or that such losses will not occur more than once in trading days

this benefit arises because the simulated one day losses for each of the four primary market risk categories occur on different days  similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each such category 
the company s aggregate trading and non trading var at november  increased from the prior year  driven predominantly by increases in interest rate and credit spread and equity price var 
the increase in year end interest rate and credit spread var was primarily related to increased exposure to credit sensitive products  including investment grade corporate debt and high credit quality asset backed products 
the increase in year end equity price var was primarily related to increased diversified exposures to liquid securities in global equity markets 
for a more representative summary of var over the course of the fiscal year  please refer to average var in table below

around this average  the company s aggregate trading var varied from day to day 
the histogram below presents the distribution of the company s daily one day aggregate trading var for its trading activities and shows that for more than of fiscal trading days  aggregate trading var ranged between million and million 
the days where aggregate trading var exceeded million occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal and were primarily the result of a concentrated single name equity exposure that was reduced prior to that quarter s end 
logo logo one method of evaluating the reasonableness of the company s var model as a measure of the company s potential volatility of net revenues is to compare the var with trading revenues 
for a one day var  the expected number of times that trading losses should exceed var during the fiscal year is three  and  in general  if trading losses were to exceed var more than five times in a year  the accuracy of the var model could be questioned 
accordingly  the company evaluates the reasonableness of its var model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results 
the histogram below shows the distribution of daily net revenues during fiscal for the company s institutional trading businesses including net interest and commissions and excluding primary revenue credited to the institutional trading businesses 
there were no days during fiscal in which the company incurred daily trading losses even when excluding primary revenues in its institutional trading business in excess of the one day aggregate trading var 
additionally  there were no trading days in fiscal where the largest one day loss exceeded the low one day aggregate trading var as reported in the high low average table 
logo logo consumer lending and related activities 
interest rate risk and management 
in its consumer lending activities  the company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates 
such changes in interest rates impact interest earning assets  principally credit card and other consumer loans and net excess servicing fees received in connection with consumer loans sold through asset securitizations  as well as the interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets  including asset backed securitizations  long term borrowings  deposits and federal funds 
the company s interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the company s right  with notice to cardmembers  to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future 
to the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively  the company utilizes interest rate derivative contracts  such as swap agreements  to achieve its objectives 
interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to variable repricing or from variable to fixed repricing 
sensitivity analysis methodology  assumptions and limitations 
for its consumer lending activities  the company uses a variety of techniques to assess its interest rate risk exposure  one of which is interest rate sensitivity simulation 
for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical  adverse change in interest rates over the month period from its fiscal year end  the company assumes that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period 
interest rate sensitive assets are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
a portion of the company s credit card receivables has a fixed interest rate  although the company has the right  with notice to cardmembers  to subsequently reprice these receivables to a new interest rate 
therefore  the company considers the receivables with a fixed interest rate to be interest rate sensitive 
the company measured the earnings sensitivity for these assets from the expected repricing date  which takes into consideration the required notice period and billing cycles 
in addition  assets that have a market based index  such as the prime rate  which will reset before the end of the month period  or assets with rates that are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature  or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate prior to the end of the month period  are rate sensitive 
the latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period  such as for balance transfers and special promotional programs  after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with the company s normal market based pricing structure 
for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans  only the effect of the hypothetical basis point change in the underlying market based indexed or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice 
for assets that have a fixed interest rate at fiscal year end but which contractually will  or are assumed to  reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate during the next months  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
in addition  for all interest rate sensitive assets  earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses 
interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
thus  liabilities that have a market based index  such as the prime  commercial paper or libor rates  which will reset before the end of the month period  or liabilities whose rates are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the month period  are rate sensitive 
for these fixed rate liabilities  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
assuming a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of november   it is estimated that the pre tax income of consumer lending and related activities over the following month period would be reduced by approximately million 
the comparable reduction of pre tax income for the month period following november  logo was estimated to be approximately million 
the increase in the reduction in pre tax income at november  was due to a higher level of variable rate financing  partially offset by a higher level of variable interest rate assets as compared with the prior year period 
the hypothetical model assumes that the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at fiscal year end will remain constant over the next month period 
it does not assume any growth  strategic change in business focus  change in asset pricing philosophy or change in asset liability funding mix 
thus  this model represents a static analysis that cannot adequately portray how the company would respond to significant changes in market conditions 
furthermore  the analysis does not necessarily reflect the company s expectations regarding the movement of interest rates in the near term  including the likelihood of an immediate basis point change in market interest rates  nor necessarily the actual effect on earnings if such rate changes were to occur 
credit risk 
institutional securities activities 
credit risk is the risk of loss to the company arising from possible borrower or counterparty default on a contractual financial commitment 
credit risk arising in connection with the company s institutional securities activities is managed by the credit department and various business lines  within parameters set by the company s senior management 
credit risk management takes place at transaction  obligor and portfolio levels 
at the transaction level  the company seeks to mitigate credit risk through management of key risk elements such as size  tenor  seniority and collateral 
at the obligor level  the company makes use of credit syndication  assignment and sale  netting agreements and collateral arrangements  and derivatives and other financial instruments 
in addition  the credit department periodically reviews the financial soundness of obligors of the company 
for portfolios of credit exposure  the company  as appropriate  assesses credit risk concentrations and purchases portfolio credit hedges 
the company has credit guidelines that limit current and potential credit exposure to any one borrower or counterparty and to aggregates of borrowers or counterparties by type of business activity 
the credit department administers these limits and monitors and reports credit exposure relative to limits 
the company incurs credit exposure as a dealer in otc derivatives activities 
the table below presents a summary by counterparty credit rating and remaining contract maturity of the fair value of otc derivatives in a gain position at november  fair value is shown taking into account the risk reduction arising from master netting agreements and  in the final column  net of collateral received principally cash and us government and agency securities otc derivative products financial instruments owned years to maturity credit rating less than over cross maturity netting net exposure pre collateral net exposure post collateral dollars in millions aaa aa a bbb non investment grade unrated total fair values shown present the company s exposure to counterparties relating to the company s otc derivative products 
the table does not include the effect of any related hedges utilized by the company 
the table also excludes fair values corresponding to other credit exposures  such as those arising from the company s lending activities 
logo credit ratings are determined by the company s credit department  using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies 
amounts represent the netting of receivable balances with payable balances for the same counterparty across maturity categories 
receivable and payable balances with the same counterparty in the same maturity category are net within such maturity category where appropriate 
in lieu of making an individual assessment of the credit of unrated counterparties  the company makes a determination that the collateral held with respect to such obligations is sufficient to cover a substantial portion of its exposure 
in making this determination  the company takes into account various factors  including legal uncertainties and market volatility 
the following tables summarize the fair values of the company s otc derivative products recorded in financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased by product category and maturity at november   including on a net basis  reflecting the fair value of related collateral for financial instruments owned otc derivative products financial instruments owned years to maturity product type less than over cross maturity netting net exposure pre collateral net exposure post collateral dollars in millions interest rate and currency swaps and options  credit derivatives and other fixed income securities contracts foreign exchange forward contracts and options equity securities contracts including equity swaps  warrants and options commodity forwards  options and swaps total otc derivative products financial instruments sold  not yet purchased years to maturity product type less than over cross maturity netting total dollars in millions interest rate and currency swaps and options  credit derivatives and other fixed income securities contracts foreign exchange forward contracts and options equity securities contracts including equity swaps  warrants and options commodity forwards  options and swaps total amounts represent the netting of receivable balances with payable balances for the same counterparty across maturity and product categories 
receivable and payable balances with the same counterparty in the same maturity category are netted within the maturity category where appropriate 
logo each category of otc derivative products in the above table includes a variety of instruments  which can differ substantially in their characteristics 
instruments in each category can be denominated in us dollars or in one or more non us currencies 
the fair values recorded in the above tables are determined by the company using various pricing models 
for a discussion of fair value as it affects the company s consolidated financial statements  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations critical accounting policies in part ii  item and note to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed under critical accounting policies  the structure of the transaction  including its maturity  is one of several important factors that may impact the price transparency 
the impact of maturity on price transparency can differ significantly among product categories 
for example  single currency and multi currency interest rate derivative products involving highly standardized terms and the major currencies eg  the eg dollar or the euro will generally have greater price transparency from published external sources even in maturity ranges beyond years 
credit derivatives with highly standardized terms and liquid underlying reference instruments can have price transparency from published external sources in a maturity ranging up to years  while equity and foreign exchange derivative products with standardized terms in major currencies can have price transparency from published external sources within a two year maturity range 
commodity derivatives with standardized terms and delivery locations can have price transparency from published external sources within various maturity ranges up to years  depending on the commodity 
in most instances of limited price transparency based on published external sources  dealers in these markets  in their capacities as market makers and liquidity providers  provide price transparency beyond the above maturity ranges 
individual investor activities 
with respect to the company s individual investor group  credit risk committees  composed of senior managers from various departments  monitor credit risk and exposure that originates from retail customers 
customer margin accounts  the primary source of retail credit exposure  are collateralized in accordance with internal and regulatory guidelines 
the company monitors required margin levels and established credit limits daily and  pursuant to such guidelines  requires customers to deposit additional collateral  or reduce positions  when necessary 
consumer lending activities 
with respect to its consumer lending activities  potential credit card holders undergo credit reviews by the credit department of discover financial services to establish that they meet standards of ability and willingness to pay 
credit card applications are evaluated using scoring models statistical evaluation models based on information obtained from applicants and credit bureaus 
the company s credit scoring systems include both industry and customized models using the company s criteria and historical data 
each cardmember s credit line is reviewed at least annually  and actions resulting from such review may include raising or lowering a cardmember s credit line or closing the account 
in addition  the company  on a portfolio basis  performs periodic monitoring and review of consumer behavior and risk profiles 
the company also reviews the creditworthiness of prospective discover business services merchants and conducts annual reviews of merchants  with the greatest scrutiny given to merchants with substantial sales volume 
operational risk 
operational risk refers generally to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in the company s operating systems  inadequacies or breaches in the company s control processes and business interruptions

logo the company has developed and continues to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels 
for example  the company s securities businesses have procedures that require that all transactions are accurately recorded and properly reflected in the company s books and records and are confirmed on a timely basis  that position valuations are subject to periodic independent review procedures  and that collateral and adequate documentation are obtained from counterparties in appropriate circumstances 
with respect to its investment management activities  the company manages operational risk related to its various data processing systems through  among other things  internal controls such as reconciliations and various backup procedures 
with respect to its consumer lending activities  the company manages operational risk through its system of internal controls that provides checks and balances to ensure that transactions and other account related activity eg  new account solicitation  transaction authorization and processing  billing and collection of delinquent accounts are properly approved  processed  recorded and reconciled 
the company also uses periodic self assessments and internal audit reviews as a further check on operational risk 
disaster recovery plans are in place for critical facilities and resources on a company wide basis  and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate 
the key components of the company s disaster recovery plans include crisis management  data and applications recovery  work area recovery  and other elements addressing management  analysis and training 
the company has also established policies  procedures and technologies to protect its computer and other assets from unauthorized access
