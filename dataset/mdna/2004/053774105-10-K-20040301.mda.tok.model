item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our business section and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
unless otherwise noted  all dollar amounts are in millions and those relating to our results of operations are presented before taxes 
we are one of the foremost providers of travel and real estate services in the world

our management team is committed to building long term value through operational excellence 
historically  a significant portion of our growth had been generated through strategic acquisitions of businesses that have strengthened our position in the travel and real estate services industries and furthered our strategy of building a hedged and diversified portfolio of businesses 
now that we have assembled our vertically integrated portfolio of businesses  we have sharply curtailed the pace of acquisitions and have emphasized organic growth and cash flow generation as principal objectives in achieving operational excellence and building long term value 
in  our spending on new acquisitions aggregated only million in cash 
although we remain highly disciplined in our acquisition activity  we may augment organic growth through the select acquisition of or possible joint venture with complementary businesses primarily in the real estate and travel services industries 
we expect to fund the purchase price of any such acquisition with cash generated by our core operations and or available lines of credit 
we also routinely review and evaluate our portfolio of existing businesses to determine if they continue to meet our growth objectives and  from time to time  engage in discussions concerning possible divestitures  joint ventures and related corporate transactions to redirect our portfolio of businesses to achieve company wide objectives 
we are steadfast in our commitment to deploy our cash to increase shareholder value 
to this end  in late  we initiated a corporate debt reduction program with the goal of decreasing our outstanding corporate indebtedness by billion 
we completed the first phase of this program during first quarter  which was to replace current maturities of corporate indebtedness with longer term debt  and we are well into the second phase of the program where as of december  we have already reduced our outstanding corporate indebtedness by over million 
we further reduced our outstanding indebtedness by million in february as a result of the conversion of our zero coupon senior convertible notes 
we intend to use the cash that otherwise would have been used to redeem these notes to repurchase a corresponding number of shares of our cd common stock in the open market 
we also plan to use call provisions and maturities wherever possible rather than paying a significant premium to repurchase our debt in the open market 
see liquidity and capital resources financial obligations for more information regarding our corporate indebtedness 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of and through february   we repurchased another million shares of our common stock at an average price of 
beginning in first quarter  we will return additional value to our shareholders through the payment of a quarterly cash dividend of seven cents per share cents per share annually and  while no assurances can be given  we expect to increase this dividend over time as our earnings and cash flow grow 
while the war in iraq  sars and other factors dampened organic growth in our travel related businesses in  we have demonstrated our ability to achieve organic earnings and cash flow growth for the company as a whole  particularly due to the strong operating results within our real estate services businesses  which benefited from greater mortgage loan refinancing activity and increased home sales volume across both our franchised and owned brokerage operations 
although no assurances can be given  we currently believe that a decrease in mortgage refinancing activity resulting from an expected rise in interest rates during should be more than offset by organic growth in our other businesses 
we also expect that organic growth will benefit in the future from our ongoing investment in technology and from cross selling opportunities across the company 
results of operations vs 
our consolidated results from continuing operations comprised the following change net revenues    total expenses    income before income taxes  minority interest and equity in homestore provision for income taxes minority interest  net of tax income from continuing operations   net revenues and total expenses increased approximately billion and billion  respectively  during principally due to the acquisitions of the following businesses  which contributed revenues and expenses including depreciation and amortization expense for the period january  through the anniversary date of the acquisition the pre anniversary period  as follows acquired business date of acquisition pre anniversary net revenues pre anniversary total expenses nrt incorporated a april   trendwest resorts  inc b april net assets of budget group  inc c november   total contributions   a represents nrt and nrt s significant brokerage acquisitions subsequent to our ownership 
principally reflects the results of operations from january through april  the corresponding period during which these businesses were not included during 
b reflects the results of operations from january through april  the corresponding period during which this business was not included during 
c principally reflects the results of operations from january through november  the corresponding period during which this business was not included during 
the above table reflects the net revenues and total expenses of the nrt  trendwest and budget businesses from january  to the anniversary date of our acquisitions thereof and  for nrt and trendwest  are not indicative of the full year operating results contributed by these businesses 
the amounts for nrt reflect the seasonality of the real estate brokerage business whereby the operating results are typically weakest in the early part of the calendar year and strengthen in the second and third quarters which are not reflected in the above amounts  as nrt was acquired on april  
the amounts for budget include acquisition and integration related costs  which were substantially incurred in the first year following the acquisition date  however  the benefits resulting from such costs are not realized until future periods 
the integration of budget represents a significant growth opportunity in future periods and is proceeding according to plan 
in addition to the contributions made by the aforementioned acquired businesses  revenues and expenses also increased during from i organic growth in our real estate services businesses  especially our real estate brokerage and mortgage businesses even after adjusting for the million non cash provision for impairment of our mortgage servicing rights asset  which we recorded in and discuss in greater detail below under real estate services and ii the consolidation of trilegiant corporation  which contributed incremental revenues and expenses after elimination entries of million and million  respectively 
the growth in our mortgage and real estate brokerage businesses also contributed to the increase in total expenses as we incurred additional expenses to support the continued high level of mortgage loan production  related servicing activities and home sale transactions 
the increases in total expenses were partially offset by a reduction of million in acquisition and integration related costs primarily due to the amortization in of the pendings and listings intangible asset acquired as part of the acquisition of nrt  which was amortized over the closing period of the underlying contracts approximately five months 
in addition  total expenses benefited by a million reduction in litigation and related charges 
our overall effective tax rate decreased to for from for primarily due to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards and lower taxes on foreign earnings  partially offset by an increase in state taxes  taxes on the redemption of our million mandatorily redeemable preferred interest and other non deductible items 
as a result of the above mentioned items  income from continuing operations increased million 
discussed below are the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenue and ebitda  which is defined as income from continuing operations before non program related depreciation and amortization  non program related interest  amortization of pendings and listings  income taxes  minority interest and  in  losses related to equity in homestore 
on january   we changed the performance measure we use to evaluate the operating results of our reportable segments and  as such  the information presented below for has been revised to reflect this change 
our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies

a includes the results of operations of our non strategic businesses  unallocated corporate overhead and the elimination of transactions between segments 
real estate services revenues and ebitda increased  million and million  respectively  in compared with  reflecting growth across all of our real estate businesses 
revenues and ebitda were primarily impacted by increased production volume and servicing revenues at our mortgage business and by the april  acquisition of nrt  our real estate brokerage subsidiary  and subsequent acquisitions by nrt of other real estate brokerages 
revenues from mortgage related activities grew million in compared with due to a significant increase in mortgage loan production  partially offset by an increase in amortization of the mortgage servicing rights msr asset  as comparatively lower interest rates during resulted in record levels of mortgage refinancing activity 
revenues and ebitda in were adversely impacted by a million non cash provision for impairment of our msr asset 
declines in interest rates at such time resulted in increases to our current and estimated future loan prepayment rates and a corresponding provision for impairment against the value of our msr asset 
excluding the million non cash msr impairment provision in  revenues from mortgage related activities increased million in revenues from mortgage loan production increased million in compared with the prior year and were derived from growth in our fee based mortgage origination operations in which we broker or are outsourced mortgage origination activity for a fee and a increase in the volume of loans that we sold 
we sold billion of mortgage loans in compared with billion in  generating incremental production revenues of million 
in addition  production revenues generated from our fee based mortgage origination activity increased million as compared with production fee income on fee based loans is generated at the time of closing  whereas originated mortgage loans held for sale generate revenues at the time of sale within days after closing 
accordingly  our production revenue in any given period is driven by a mix of mortgage loans closed and mortgage loans sold 
total mortgage loans closed increased billion to billion in  comprised of a billion increase in closed loans to be securitized sold by us and a billion increase in closed loans that were fee based 
refinancings increased billion to billion and purchase mortgage closings grew billion to billion 
net revenues from servicing mortgage loans increased million primarily due to the million non cash provision for impairment of our msr asset recorded in  as discussed above 
apart from this impairment charge  net servicing revenues declined million primarily due to a period over period increase in msr amortization and provision for impairment recorded as a contra revenue of million  partially offset by million of incremental gains from hedging and other derivative activities 
the increase in msr amortization and provision for impairment is a result of the high levels of refinancings and related mortgage loan prepayments that occurred in due to low mortgage interest rates during the incremental gains from hedging and other derivative activities resulted from our strategies to protect earnings in the event that there was a decline in the value of our msr asset  which can be caused by  among other factors  reductions in interest rates  as such reductions tend to increase borrower prepayment activity 
in addition  recurring servicing fees fees received for servicing existing loans in the portfolio  increased million driven by a period over period increase in the average servicing portfolio  which rose to billion in interest rates have risen from their lows in the earlier part of and  as a result  in fourth quarter mortgage refinancing volume and resulting net production revenues comparatively declined 
this decline in mortgage production revenues has been partially offset by an increase in revenues from mortgage servicing activities 
assuming interest rates remain constant or continue to rise  although no assurances can be given  we expect this trend lower production revenue  partially offset by increased servicing revenue  net of hedging and other derivative activity to continue during historically  mortgage production and mortgage servicing operations have been counter cyclical in nature and represented a naturally offsetting relationship 
additionally  to supplement this relationship  we have maintained a comprehensive  non speculative mortgage risk management program to further mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our operating results 
we acquired nrt inclusive of its title and closing business  which are now included in our settlement services business on april  and  in addition  nrt acquired real estate brokerage businesses subsequent to our ownership 
the operating results of nrt and its significant acquisitions were included from their acquisition dates forward and  therefore  contributed  million of revenues and an ebitda decline of million during the pre anniversary period in the ebitda decline is reflective of the seasonality of the real estate brokerage business  whereby the operating results are typically weakest in the early part of the calendar year and strengthen in the second and third quarters 
excluding the impact of nrt s brokerage acquisitions  nrt generated incremental net revenues of million  a increase in the comparable post acquisition periods in versus the increase in nrt s revenues was substantially comprised of incremental commission income on home sale transactions  primarily due to a increase in the average price of homes sold 
real estate agent commission expenses also increased million as a result of the incremental revenues earned on home sale transactions 
during  prior to our acquisition of nrt  we received royalty and marketing fees from nrt of million  real estate referral fees of million  and a million termination fee related to a franchise agreement under which nrt operated brokerage offices under our era real estate brand 
we also had a preferred stock investment in nrt  which generated dividend income of million prior to our acquisition in in addition  revenues in benefited from million with no impact on ebitda relating to certain accounting reclassifications made in primarily in connection with the merger of our pre existing title and closing businesses with and into the larger scale title and appraisal business of nrt 
upon combining such businesses  we changed certain accounting presentations used by our pre existing businesses to conform to the presentations used by nrt 
excluding such reclassifications  our settlement services business generated incremental revenues of million compared with title  appraisal and other closing fees all increased due to higher volumes  consistent with the growth in the mortgage origination markets through the first nine months of  as well as cross selling initiatives 
on a comparable basis  including royalties paid by nrt to our real estate franchise business  our real estate franchise business generated year over year incremental royalties and marketing fund revenues of million in  an increase of over nrt contributed million of royalties to our real estate franchise business in and million of royalties in  of which million was contributed after our acquisition of nrt 
the increase in royalties and marketing fund revenues within our real estate franchise business was principally driven by a increase in volume of home sale transactions and a increase in the average price of homes sold 
royalty increases in the real estate franchise business are recognized with little or no corresponding increase in expenses due to the significant operating leverage within our franchise operations 
excluding the impact from our acquisition of nrt  nrt s significant acquisitions and nrt s real estate agent commission expenses discussed above  operating and administrative expenses within this segment increased approximately million compared to primarily due to the direct costs incurred in connection with increased mortgage loan production and related servicing activities 
hospitality services revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with we completed the acquisitions of trendwest  a leading vacation ownership company  in june was acquired in april  equivest finance  inc in february  and several european vacation rental companies during the operating results of the acquired companies were included from the acquisition dates forward and therefore were incremental for the portions of that were pre acquisition periods in accordingly  trendwest  equivest  and the acquired vacation rental companies contributed incremental revenues of million  million and million  respectively  and ebitda of million  million and million  respectively  in compared with in february  we acquired the common interests of ffd development company  llc ffd  the primary developer of timeshare inventory for our fairfield resorts subsidiary 
the operating results of ffd were included from the acquisition date forward and were not significant to our segment results subsequent to our acquisition 
prior to our acquisition  we owned a preferred stock investment in ffd  which accrued a dividend  and we also received additional fees from ffd for providing various support services 
accordingly  prior to our acquisition  ffd contributed revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively  to results 
excluding the impact from acquisitions described above  revenues in increased million while ebitda declined million and the ebitda margin ebitda as a percentage of revenues dropped from in to in the reduction in ebitda margin was driven principally by a shift in the mix of business operations comprising segment results in compared with and a reduction in travel demand during due to the military conflict in iraq as well as economic pressures  which contributed to suppressing volumes within certain of our hospitality businesses 
despite a challenging travel environment  revenues from sales of vacation ownership interests vois in our timeshare sales and marketing business increased million in  an increase over this increase was driven primarily by a increase in tour flow and a increase in the average revenue generated per tour at our timeshare resort sites 
the growth in our timeshare sales and marketing businesses positively impacted the segment results and also contributed to a lower year over year segment ebitda margin  as this business typically operates with lower margins than our lodging franchise and timeshare exchange businesses  which have greater operating leverage 
net interest income generated from the financing extended to voi buyers decreased million as the effects of growth in the loan portfolio were more than offset by the impact of consolidating our principal timeshare securitization structure in september and  at such time  no longer recording gains on the sale of receivables to such entity see note to our consolidated financial statements 
timeshare subscription and exchange fee revenues within our timeshare exchange business increased million  primarily due to a increase in the average fee per exchange  which was partially offset by a reduction in the volume of exchange transactions 
the increase in the average exchange fee includes a favorable yield on increased rentals of excess rci vacation interval inventory to rci members in compared with royalties and marketing and reservation fund revenues within our lodging franchise operations declined million in due to a decline in the number of weighted average rooms available following our decision to terminate from our franchise system certain properties that were not meeting required standards 
however  such quality control initiatives also contributed to an increase in the occupancy levels and average daily room rates at our lodging brands  and  as a result  revenue per available room increased period over period and partially offset the impact on royalties from the reduction in available rooms 
our lodging franchise business and our franchisees were unfavorably impacted by the weaker travel environment  as previously discussed  and as a result  during  we recorded an incremental million of non cash expenses related to the doubtful collectability of certain franchisee receivables 
in addition  although revenues and ebitda were nominally impacted on a consolidated basis  preferred alliance revenues within this segment declined million in due to a change in the allocation of such revenues 
revenues received from preferred vendors in substantially benefited the hospitality services segment whereas in  the benefits of such revenues extended to business units within other reportable segments 
excluding acquisitions  operating and administrative expenses within this segment increased approximately million in principally due to increased timeshare sales related expenses  including marginal expense increases on higher sales volumes  higher product costs on developed timeshare inventory and an increased investment in marketing spending to enhance tour flow 
travel distribution services revenues and ebitda declined million and million  respectively  in compared with our travel distribution services segment derives revenue from i galileo booking fees paid by travel suppliers for electronic global distribution and computer reservation services gds  ii fees and commissions for retail travel services provided by cendant travel  cheap tickets and lodging 
com and iii transaction and other fees from providing travel distribution services 
like other industry participants  this segment was unfavorably impacted by weak global travel demand during travel demand in was negatively affected by various factors  including the military conflict in iraq and terrorist threat alerts  continuing economic pressures and sars concerns in the asia pacific region and other parts of the world 
such factors suppressed bookings and revenues across our travel distribution businesses  but primarily impacted international travel volumes 
galileo worldwide air booking fees decreased million primarily due to a decline in international gds booking volumes  partially offset by domestic gds booking volumes  which stabilized in compared with galileo acquired certain european national distribution companies ndcs during ndcs are independent organizations that market and sell galileo global distribution and computer reservation services to travel agents and other subscribers 
the ndc acquisitions contributed incremental subscriber fee revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively  in during the summer of  we also acquired two other companies that supply reservation and distribution services to the hospitality industry 
the operating results of such companies were included from the acquisition dates forward and collectively contributed revenue of million with a nominal ebitda impact during in april  we completed the acquisition of trip network inc  an online travel agent that operated the online travel services business of cheap tickets 
from the acquisition date forward  trip network generated million of revenues and had an ebitda loss of million in in addition  principally as a result of our ownership of trip network  an incremental million of intercompany segment revenues were eliminated in  most of which were trip network revenues earned from galileo for airline bookings made by trip network using galileo s gds system 
our online booking volumes grew in compared with  primarily due to i a shift in travel bookings from the traditional off line channels to online channels  ii an increase in online travel bookings  and iii increased merchant model hotel bookings where we  as a travel distributor  obtain access to content from travel suppliers at a pre determined price and sell the content  either individually or in a package  to travelers at retail prices that we determine with little or no risk of inventory loss 
additionally  revenues from our off line travel agency business declined million in  as we accelerated our shift to the online channel 
the results of our online and off line travel agency operations are reflective of the general industry decline in travel demand during  as previously discussed  reductions in commission rates paid by airlines  the lack of reduced rate air inventory availability and a decline in travel related clubs which we service 
such results also reflect our investment in the marketing and administration of our online travel services business  which we believe represents a significant opportunity for future growth 
the ebitda impact of lower gds and travel agency revenues was partially offset by a corresponding decline in variable expenses  reductions in retiree medical costs as a result of post retirement plan amendments and other net reductions in operating expenses from segment wide re engineering and cost containment initiatives implemented in and these operating expense reductions helped mitigate the negative impact of the weak travel environment that existed during additionally  ebitda in was favorably impacted by million in connection with a contract termination settlement during first quarter vehicle services revenues and ebitda increased  million and million  respectively  in compared with primarily due to our november acquisition of substantially all of the domestic assets  as well as selected international operations  of the vehicle rental business of budget group  inc budget s operating results  including integration costs  were included from the acquisition date forward and contributed incremental revenues of  million with an ebitda decline of million in excluding the impact of budget  segment revenues declined million less than  while ebitda increased million in  which is primarily attributable to reduced car rental demand  offset by increased pricing  at avis and favorable results at our wright express fuel card services subsidiary 
avis domestic car rental revenues declined million in compared with the net reduction in domestic car rental revenues at avis was primarily due to a period over period reduction in the total number of car rental days 
this was partially offset by a increase in time and mileage revenue per rental day reflecting an increase in pricing  which has minimal associated incremental costs 
in addition  ebitda  period over period  includes favorable program related interest costs of million on the financing of vehicles due to lower interest rates and million of lower program related depreciation expense on vehicles due to a different mix of vehicles in avis fleet bearing a lower cost in compared with this favorable impact on ebitda was substantially offset by incremental vehicle related net expenses and other operating costs 
the increase in net expenses includes incremental maintenance and damage costs  higher vehicle license and registration fees and unfavorable conditions in the used car market in compared with for vehicles that did not meet the eligibility criteria under our manufacturers repurchase program 
however  the percentage of avis fleet that was determined ineligible for manufacturer repurchase decreased to in from in revenues from avis international operations increased million due to increased transaction volume and the favorable impact to revenues of exchange rates in canada  australia and new zealand  which was principally offset in ebitda by the unfavorable impact on expenses 
wright express  our fuel card services subsidiary  recognized incremental revenues of million in compared with the prior year 
the organic growth was driven by a combination of the addition of new customers and an increase in usage of wright express proprietary fleet fuel card product 
higher gasoline prices also contributed to the revenue growth  since wright express earns a percentage of total gasoline purchases by its clients 
financial services revenues increased million and ebitda declined million  respectively  in compared with effective july   pursuant to the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  we consolidated trilegiant 
trilegiant on a stand alone basis before elimination of intercompany transactions with our retained membership business contributed revenues of million and an ebitda loss of million subsequent to consolidation in apart from the consolidation of trilegiant  revenues and ebitda declined million and million  respectively  reflecting  as expected  the continued attrition of the membership base retained by us in connection with the outsourcing of our individual membership business to trilegiant 
however  the unfavorable impact of reduced revenues on ebitda was mitigated by a net reduction in expenses from servicing fewer members 
a smaller membership base resulted in a net revenue reduction of million net of million of increased royalty income from trilegiant  which was partially offset in ebitda by net favorable membership operating and marketing expenses of million 
as a result of the consolidation of trilegiant  we eliminated million of intercompany revenues within this segment in  which was substantially comprised of royalty and lease payments made from trilegiant to our pre existing membership business subsequent to the consolidation of trilegiant on july  for a more detailed discussion of our relationship with trilegiant and the consolidation thereof as a result of fin  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  in january  we made modifications to the existing relationship with trilegiant 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed account of such modifications 
partially offsetting the impact of the attrition in our retained membership business  was revenue growth in our jackson hewitt tax service operations  favorable results of our insurance wholesale related operations and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the revenues of our international membership business which was principally offset in ebitda by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on expenses 
in  jackson hewitt generated incremental franchise royalty and tax preparation revenues of million and million  respectively  which was partially offset by a million reduction in revenues generated from financial product programs and other tax related services 
the increase in royalties and tax preparation fees was principally driven by a increase in total system tax return volume and a increase in the average price per return 
royalties generated in our franchise operations are typically recognized with nominal increases in expenses due to significant operating leverage within this business  however  during  we invested an incremental million in marketing for the jackson hewitt business and were negatively impacted by a million expense incurred in connection with a litigation settlement 
revenues from insurance wholesale related operations increased million as a result of favorable claims experience period over period and increased insurance premium collections 
additionally  in second quarter  we ceased marketing and selling new long term care policies within our long term preferred care business  but will continue servicing the existing in force block of policy holders 
this resulted in a reduction in revenue of million with a nominal impact to ebitda 
in  ebitda was also impacted by a million charge for actions taken in third quarter at our international membership business  which included the closure and consolidation of certain facilities and a reduction in staff in the united kingdom 
corporate and other revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with revenues and ebitda include a million gain in connection with the sale of our equity investment in entertainment publication  inc recorded during first quarter also  we earned revenues in both and in connection with credit card marketing programs whereby we earn revenues based on a percentage of credit card spending 
additionally  we recognized expenses as cardholders earned points based on credit card usage 
we generated million of incremental revenues and incurred million of additional point related liabilities during in connection with these programs 
partially offsetting the revenue increases were million of incremental intersegment revenue eliminations in due to increased intercompany business activities 
ebitda was favorable year over year principally due to a million net reduction in securities related litigation charges litigation charges less insurance recoveries in compared with principally as a result of the absence in of litigation settlements and accruals established in in connection with all remaining cuc related securities litigation 
also contributing to the favorable ebitda change was a million reduction in bonus expenses and other incentive based compensation 
in addition  ebitda was favorably impacted by a greater absorption of overhead expenses by our reportable operating segments during compared with principally due to revenue growth at our business units expenses are allocated on a percentage of revenue basis and expense allocations in to companies acquired during partially offsetting favorable ebitda was a million accrual recorded in to revise our original estimate of costs to exit a facility in connection with the previous outsourcing of our data center operations 
results of operations vs

b excludes million of non cash amortization of the pendings and listings intangible asset and million of acquisition and integration related costs  which are discussed below 
in addition to the contributions made by acquired businesses  net revenues were favorably impacted by growth in our real estate services and vehicle services segments exclusive of acquisitions  which also contributed to the increase in total expenses as we incurred additional expenses to support this growth 
further contributing to the increase in total expenses is million of additional acquisition and integration related charges recorded during see note to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of acquisition and integration related charges recorded in and partially offsetting the increase in total expenses recorded during was a million reduction in restructuring and other unusual charges see note to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of restructuring and other unusual charges recorded during and additionally  our operating results were impacted by gains and losses related to the dispositions of businesses  as well as by losses related to the impairment of investments  while our results were not impacted by such events 
during  these events resulted in i million of gains primarily related to the sale of our real estate internet portal million  ii million of losses related to the dispositions of non strategic businesses and iii million of losses related to the impairment of our investments in homestore  inc million and lodging and internet related businesses million 
our overall effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
the effective rate for was higher due to the negative impact of a reduction in the amount of foreign tax credits and state net operating losses that were utilized  which were only partially offset by the benefit from the impact on the tax provision from the elimination of goodwill amortization 
our operating results were also negatively impacted by after tax losses of million related to our equity ownership in homestore  which was received in connection with the sale of our internet real estate portal to homestore in february for a detailed discussion regarding the sale of our real estate internet portal and our investment in homestore  refer to notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the above mentioned items  income from continuing operations increased million during discussed below are the results of operations for each of our reportable segments  which has been revised to reflect the previously described change in the performance measure that we use to evaluate the operating results of our reportable segments

real estate services revenues and ebitda increased billion and million  respectively  during principally driven by the acquisition of nrt the operating results of which have been included in our consolidated results since april  nrt contributed revenue and ebitda of billion and million  respectively 
prior to our acquisition of nrt  we received royalty and marketing fees of million  real estate referral fees of million and termination fees of million from nrt during for the period from january  through april   nrt paid us royalty and marketing fees of million  real estate referral fees of million and a termination fee of million 
we also had a preferred stock investment in nrt prior to our acquisition that generated dividend income of million and million during and  respectively 
on a comparable basis  including post acquisition intercompany royalties paid by nrt  our real estate franchise brands generated year over year incremental royalties of million in  an increase of over the increase in royalties from our real estate franchise brands primarily resulted from a increase in home sale transactions by franchisees and nrt  and a increase in the average price of homes sold 
royalty increases in the real estate franchise business are recognized with little or no corresponding increase in expenses due to the significant operating leverage within our franchise operations 
industry statistics provided by the national association of realtors for the twelve months ended december  indicate that the number of single family homes sold increased versus the prior year  while the average price of those homes sold increased approximately 
through our continued franchise sales efforts  we have grown our franchised operations and in conjunction with nrt acquisitions of real estate brokerages  we have increased market share as our transaction volume has significantly outperformed the industry 
revenues and ebitda in were negatively impacted by a million non cash provision for impairment of our msr asset 
as noted elsewhere herein under critical accounting policies  the valuation of our msr asset is generated by numerous estimates and assumptions  the most noteworthy being future prepayment rates  which represent the borrowers propensity to refinance their mortgages 
today s mortgage industry enables homeowners to more easily refinance than they could in the past producing a change in consumer behavior that results in a greater likelihood to refinance in periods of declining interest rates  as experienced in the third quarter of during such period  interest rates on ten year treasury notes and year mortgages declined by basis points and basis points  respectively  which at such time  resulted in the lowest interest rate levels in years 
as a result  we recognized that steep declines in interest rates experienced throughout the quarter and the related impact on current borrower prepayment behavior necessitated an increase to our estimate of future prepayment rates 
therefore  we updated the third party model we use to value our msr asset to one that had recently become available in the marketplace  and revised our assumptions in order to better reflect more current borrower prepayment behavior 
the combination of these factors resulted in increases to our estimated future loan prepayment rates  which negatively impacted the value of our msr asset  hence requiring the provision for impairment of our msr asset 
further declines in interest rates due to a weakening economy and geopolitical risks  which result in an increase in refinancing activity or changes in the methodology of valuing our msr asset  could adversely impact the valuation 
excluding the million non cash provision for impairment of our msr asset  revenues from mortgage related activities increased million in compared with as revenue growth from mortgage production was principally offset by a decline in net revenues from mortgage servicing activities 
revenues from mortgage loan production increased million in compared with the prior year due to substantial growth in our fee based mortgage origination operations explained below and a increase in the volume of loans that we packaged and securitized sold by us 
in  revenues generated from our fee based outsourcing and broker origination business grew at a faster rate than revenues generated from packaging and selling mortgage loans to the secondary market ourselves 
production fee income on fee based loans is generated at the time of closing  whereas originated mortgage loans held for sale generate revenues at the time of sale within days after closing 
accordingly  our production revenue is driven by more of a mix in both mortgage loans closed and mortgage loans sold as opposed to just loans sold 
production loans sold increased billion  generating incremental production revenues of million 
mortgage loans closed increased billion to billion  comprised of a billion increase in closed loans that were fee based and a million increase in closed loans to be securitized 
the increase in fee based loan volume contributed incremental production revenues of million in compared with purchase mortgage closings grew to billion  and refinancings increased to billion 
additionally  in connection with our securitized loans we realized an increase in margin which is consistent with the mortgage industry operating at a higher percentage of loan production capacity 
net revenues from servicing mortgage loans declined million  excluding the million non cash provision for impairment of our msr asset 
however  recurring servicing fees fees received for servicing existing loans in the portfolio increased million primarily due to a year over year increase in the average servicing portfolio 
such recurring activity was more than offset by million of increased mortgage servicing rights amortization and valuation adjustments due to the high levels of refinancings and related loan prepayments  resulting from the lower interest rate environment  partially offset by million of incremental net gains from hedging and other derivative activities to protect against changes in the fair value of our msr asset due to fluctuations in interest rates 
revenues and ebitda of this segment were also negatively impacted by a reduction of million in revenue generated from relocation activities as a result of a decline in relocation related homesale activity and lower interest rates charged to our clients 
also contributing to the increase in ebitda is the absence in of the following charges recorded during i million related to the funding of an irrevocable contribution to the real estate technology trust and ii million related to the impairment of our mortgage servicing rights 
this million charge did not impact revenue as it was separately presented as an expense on our consolidated statement of income for see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information concerning this presentation 
excluding the acquisition of nrt  operating and administrative expenses within this segment increased million 
higher expenses incurred to operate the mortgage business to support the continued high levels of mortgage loan production and related servicing activities were partially offset by a reduction in relocation related costs  adjusting to a weaker corporate spending environment 
hospitality services revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  primarily due to the acquisitions of fairfield resorts  inc in april  trendwest in april and equivest in february and certain other vacation rental companies abroad in and fairfield  for the first quarter of the period in which no comparable results were included in  trendwest  equivest and the other acquired vacation rental companies  contributed incremental revenues of million  million  million  and million  respectively  and incremental ebitda of million  million  million and million  respectively  in compared with excluding the impact from these acquisitions  revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  year over year 
growth within our vacation rental group exclusive of acquisitions contributed incremental revenues of million in due to an increase in vacation weeks sold  primarily attributable to improved marketing efforts 
timeshare subscription and transaction revenues within our timeshare exchange business increased million primarily due to increases in exchange transactions and the average exchange fee 
during  we recognized an incremental million of income from providing the financing on timeshare unit sales at our fairfield subsidiary 
the additional financing income was generated as a result of a increase in the volume of contracts sold and a greater margin realized on contract sales as we benefited from a lower interest rate environment in compared with results within our lodging franchise operation continued to be suppressed during  subsequent to the september  terrorist attacks and their impact on an already weakening travel industry 
accordingly  royalties  marketing fund and reservations revenues within our lodging franchise operations were down million in compared with and initial franchise fees were down million over the same periods 
however  comparable year over year occupancy levels in our franchised lodging brands have shown improvement during in addition  preferred alliance revenues and ebitda declined million in compared with  primarily from contract expirations and a contract termination payment received in the prior year 
further contributing to the increase in ebitda is a benefit of million from a venture master license agreement with marriott international  inc entered into during  which converted the ownership of a third party license agreement 
upon the change in ownership  the license fee  formerly included within operating expenses  is now recorded as a minority interest expense below ebitda 
ebitda in this segment also benefited in from the absence of million of charges incurred during primarily in connection with the september  terrorist attacks million principally related to restructuring and other initiatives and million related to the impairment of a lodging investment 
excluding acquisitions  operating and administrative expenses within this segment increased approximately million in principally to support continued volume related growth in our timeshare exchange business throughout compared to travel distribution services revenues and ebitda increased billion and million  respectively  in compared with  due to the october acquisitions of galileo and cheap tickets 
the galileo acquisition for the nine months ended september  the period in which no comparable results were included in contributed incremental revenues and ebitda of billion and million  respectively  while cheap tickets contributed incremental revenues of million and ebitda losses of million over the same period 
in addition  during the summer of  we acquired lodging 
com and trust international  two companies that supply reservation and distribution solution services to the hospitality industry 
lodging 
com and trust international s operating results were included from the acquisition dates forward and collectively contributed revenue of million with no contribution to ebitda during excluding the incremental contributions from the above mentioned acquisitions  revenues and ebitda of this segment increased million and million  respectively  in compared with galileo subscriber fees and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  during due to the acquisition of national distribution companies ndcs in europe 
ndcs are independent organizations that market and sell galileo global distribution and computer reservation services to travel agents and other subscribers 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline of million in revenues generated from our travel agency business due to reductions in commission rates paid by the airlines  available net rate air inventory and members of travel related clubs which are serviced by us 
ebitda in this segment also benefited in from the absence of million of charges incurred during in connection with the acquisitions of galileo and cheap tickets 
beginning with the fourth quarter  all quarterly periods became comparable in terms of being subsequent to the acquisitions of galileo and cheap tickets and the september terrorist attacks 
in fourth quarter  galileo air travel booking fees were relatively constant  compared with fourth quarter  as a increase in booking volumes was substantially offset by a decline in the effective yield per booking 
the decline in effective yield was heavily influenced by unusually high cancellation and re booking activity in the fourth quarter of due to the september  terrorist attacks 
ebitda in fourth quarter the period comparable with includes cost savings of approximately million that were realized in connection with the integration of the galileo and cheap tickets businesses  including cost reduction efforts that were initiated during fourth quarter to reflect expected business volumes subsequent to the september  terrorist attacks 
vehicle services revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in versus the comparable prior year 
principally driving these increases were the incremental contributions made by avis group holdings  inc comprised of the avis rental car business and our fleet management operations  which we acquired on march  prior to the acquisition of avis  revenues and ebitda of this segment consisted of franchise royalties received from avis and earnings losses from our equity investment in avis 
avis operating results were included from the acquisition date forward and therefore included ten months of results in march through december 
accordingly  the avis acquisition for january and february of the period for which no comparable results were included in contributed incremental revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively 
additionally  the operating results of budget were also included from the acquisition date of november  forward and contributed revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively  in on a comparable basis  excluding the acquisition of budget ten months ended december  versus the comparable prior year period  revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively 
for the ten months ended december   avis car rental revenues increased million over the comparable period in  primarily due to a increase in time and mileage revenue per rental day 
a majority of the increase in time and mileage revenue per rental day was supported by an increase in pricing  the impact of which flows to ebitda  and an increased share of domestic airport revenue generated by car rental companies 
the increase in ebitda was principally supported by the gross margin on the revenue growth 
avis revenues are primarily derived from car rentals at airport locations 
through november the last period for which information is available  approximately of avis revenues were generated from car rental locations at airports 
avis increased its share of total car rental revenues generated at domestic airports through november to compared with a share over the same eleven month period last year and has recognized airport revenue share gains in consecutive months since february for the eleven months ended november   avis realized a increase in its comparable year over year domestic airport revenues versus a total market segment decline of over the same periods 
in our vehicle leasing and fleet management program businesses  revenues collectively declined million during the comparable ten months ended december  compared with  principally due to lower interest expense on vehicle funding  which is substantially passed through to clients and therefore results in lower revenues but has minimal ebitda impact 
this was partially offset by an increase in depreciation on leased vehicles which is also passed through to clients 
ebitda for this segment also benefited in from the absence of million of charges recorded in primarily in connection with restructuring and other initiatives undertaken as a result of the september  terrorist attacks 
financial services ebitda increased million in compared with  despite a million decrease in revenue 
ebitda was favorably impacted by the outsourcing of our individual membership business  in which a net decline of million in membership related revenues net of million of royalty income from trilegiant due to a lower membership base was more than offset by a net reduction in expenses from servicing fewer members and not directly incurring the cost of marketing to solicit new members 
marketing expenses decreased by million in compared with due to a reduction in new member marketing costs in in addition  during fourth quarter  trilegiant increased its solicitation efforts and incurred million of marketing costs that we were contractually required to fund and  as such  expense 
in addition  membership operating expenses decreased by approximately million due to cost savings from servicing fewer members 
during third quarter  we incurred million of transaction related expenses in connection with the outsourcing of our membership business to trilegiant  the absence of which in also contributed to the increase in ebitda 
jackson hewitt generated incremental revenues of million in in january  we acquired our largest tax preparation franchisee  tax services of america tsa 
tsa contributed incremental revenues of million and ebitda of approximately million net of intercompany royalties to jackson hewitt s results 
jackson hewitt also generated incremental revenues of million in from various financial products 
additionally  on a comparable basis  including post acquisition intercompany royalties paid by tsa  jackson hewitt franchise royalties increased million 
the increase in jackson hewitt royalties was driven by a increase in tax return volume  and a increase in the average price per return 
additional operating and overhead costs were incurred in due to an expansion of jackson hewitt s infrastructure to support increased business activity and a reorganization and relocation of the jackson hewitt technology group 
our domestic insurance wholesale businesses generated million less revenue in compared with from a lower profit share from insurance companies as a result of higher than expected claims 
this was offset by growth within our international loyalty solutions operations 
partially offsetting the decline in ebitda for this segment was a benefit in from the absence of million of charges recorded in in connection with restructuring and other initiatives undertaken as a result of the september  terrorist attacks 
corporate and other revenue decreased million and ebitda increased million in compared with in february  we sold our real estate internet portal  move 
com  and certain ancillary businesses  the operations of which collectively accounted for a year over year decline in revenues of million and ebitda of million 
revenues recognized from providing electronic reservation processing services to avis prior to the acquisition of avis resulted in a million revenue decrease with no ebitda impact as avis paid royalties but was billed for reservation services at cost 
revenues also included incremental inter segment revenue eliminations in due to increased intercompany business activities  principally resulting from acquisitions 
ebitda benefited in from million of losses recorded during  which were principally related to the impairment of our investment in homestore 
partially offsetting this improvement was the absence in of a gain of million that was recorded in in connection with the sale of our real estate internet portal 
ebitda for this segment also benefited in from the absence of the following charges recorded during i the funding of trip network million  ii the outsourcing of our information technology operations to ibm in connection with the acquisition of galileo million and iii restructuring and other initiatives undertaken as a result of the september  terrorist attacks million 
partially offsetting such year over year ebitda benefits were higher unallocated corporate overhead costs in due to increased administrative expenses and infrastructure expansion to support company growth 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we present separately the financial data of our management and mortgage programs 
these programs are distinct from our other activities as the assets are generally funded through the issuance of debt that is collateralized by such assets 
specifically  in our vehicle rental  fleet management  relocation  mortgage services and vacation ownership businesses  assets under management and mortgage programs are funded through either borrowings under asset backed funding arrangements or unsecured borrowings at our phh subsidiary 
such borrowings are classified as debt under management and mortgage programs 
the income generated by these assets is used  in part  to repay the principal and interest associated with the debt 
cash inflows and outflows relating to the generation or acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as activities of our management and mortgage programs 
we believe it is appropriate to segregate the financial data of our management and mortgage programs because  ultimately  the source of repayment of such debt is the realization of such assets 
financial condition change total assets exclusive of assets under management and mortgage programs total liabilities exclusive of liabilities under management and mortgage programs   assets under management and mortgage programs liabilities under management and mortgage programs mandatorily redeemable preferred interest in a subsidiary stockholders equity total assets exclusive of assets under management and mortgage programs increased primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents see liquidity and capital resources cash flows for a detailed discussion and goodwill  which primarily resulted from current period acquisitions and the ultimate settlement of tax bases on prior period acquisitions with the tax authorities see note to our consolidated financial statements 
such increases were partially offset by i a reduction in timeshare related inventory as a result of a reclassification to assets under management and mortgage programs  as such assets were financed under a program during first quarter  ii a decrease in non current deferred income taxes primarily resulting from the utilization of a portion of our net operating loss carryforward and the ultimate settlements with tax authorities discussed above and iii the sale of real estate in the normal course of our mortgage services business 
total liabilities exclusive of liabilities under management and mortgage programs increased primarily due to i an increase in deferred income principally resulting from the consolidation of trilegiant and ii gains on derivatives we use to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our outstanding corporate indebtedness  which are deferred and will be recognized over future periods as an offset to interest expense 
such increases were offset by a net reduction in outstanding corporate debt see liquidity and capital resources financial obligations corporate indebtedness for a detailed account of this reduction 
assets under management and mortgage programs increased primarily due to growth in our mortgage and vehicle businesses  the impact of fin and the impact of changes to the underlying structures of certain of our securitization facilities 
specifically contributing to the increase were increases in i our mortgage loans held for sale principally due to the consolidation of bishop s gate residential mortgage trust  ii our msr asset principally resulting from an increase in the aggregate amount of the mortgage portfolio we service  iii our relocation receivables principally due to the consolidation of apple ridge funding llc  iv our timeshare related assets principally resulting from the consolidation of the sierra receivable funding entities  the acquisition of ffd development company  llc and the reclassification of timeshare related inventory referred to above and v our vehicle related assets primarily due to the purchase of vehicles used in our vehicle rental operations 
see liquidity and capital resources financial obligations debt under management and mortgage programs for a more extensive discussion regarding the impact of fin and the changes to the underlying structures of apple ridge and the sierra entities 
liabilities under management and mortgage programs increased primarily due to the consolidation of bishop s gate  the sierra entities and apple ridge and additional debt borrowings to support the growth in our portfolio of assets under management and mortgage programs  as discussed above see liquidity and capital resources financial obligations debt under management and mortgage programs for a detailed account of the change in debt related to management and mortgage programs 
the decrease in mandatorily redeemable preferred interest represents our prepayment of these securities in september stockholders equity increased primarily due to i  million of net income generated during  ii million related to the exercise of employee stock options including million of tax benefit and iii million of favorable foreign currency translation adjustments 
such increases were partially offset by our repurchase of  million million shares in cd common stock 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and our ability to generate cash through operations and financing activities  as well as available funding arrangements and committed credit facilities  each of which is discussed below 
cash flows at december   we had million of cash on hand  an increase of million from million at december  the following table summarizes such increase year ended december  change cash provided by used in operating activities   a  investing activities   b  financing activities    effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents cash provided by discontinued operations net change in cash and cash equivalents   a includes i the application of billion of payments made to the stockholder litigation settlement trust in to extinguish a portion of the principal stockholder litigation settlement liability and ii billion of payments made during to extinguish a portion of the principal stockholder litigation settlement liability 
b includes billion of proceeds from the principal stockholder litigation settlement trust  which were used during the same period to extinguish a portion of the principal stockholder litigation settlement liability  as discussed in a above 
during  we generated approximately billion more cash from operating activities as compared to this change principally reflects the completion of our funding the principal stockholder litigation settlement liability in  as noted in the table above 
excluding the effects of the principal stockholder litigation settlement funding  net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately billion 
such change primarily represents i stronger operating results  ii better management of our working capital  iii proceeds received from the termination of fair value interest rate hedges of corporate debt instruments and iv activities of our management and mortgage programs  which produced a larger cash inflow in resulting primarily from timing differences between the receipt of cash on the sale of previously originated mortgage loans and the origination of new mortgage loans 
during  we used approximately billion more cash in investing activities as compared to this change principally reflects the absence in of i billion of proceeds received in from the stockholder litigation settlement trust  which represented funds that we deposited to the trust in that were then used in to fund the stockholder litigation settlement liability  as discussed above  and ii approximately billion in net proceeds received from the may sale of our car parking facility business 
excluding these amounts  we used approximately million less cash for investing activities during as compared to this decrease primarily reflects our decision to significantly curtail acquisitions  as evidenced by a reduction of more than billion in cash used for this purpose 
also contributing to this change were incremental proceeds received in on the sale of assets  including our investment in entertainment publications  inc and the sale leaseback of two of our facilities 
we also increased our capital expenditures in by million to support operational growth and businesses acquired in  and to enhance marketing opportunities and develop operating efficiencies through technological improvements 
we anticipate aggregate capital expenditure investments for to be in the range of million to million 
we also used million more cash in compared to in the investment activities of our management and mortgage programs due primarily to timing differences within our timeshare and relocation programs similar to those discussed above with respect to mortgage activities 
the increase in cash utilization was partially offset by a reduction in the year over year net cash outflow resulting from investments in and payments received on vehicles 
during  we used approximately billion of net cash in financing activities as compared to using approximately billion of net cash during while we benefited from approximately billion of proceeds received during on the issuance of fixed rate debt  this cash was deployed primarily to increase debt repayments and share repurchases period over period 
these actions demonstrate our commitment to reducing outstanding corporate indebtedness and returning shareholder value 
further contributing to this change is an increase of billion in the cash used in the financing activities of our management and mortgage programs  primarily resulting from greater repayments of borrowings in see liquidity and capital resources financial obligations for a detailed discussion of financing activities during throughout  we intend to continue to demonstrate our commitment to improving our balance sheet by reducing corporate indebtedness and repurchasing outstanding shares of our common stock 
in february  virtually all holders of our zero coupon senior convertible contingent notes elected to convert their notes into shares of our common stock 
as a result  our corporate indebtedness decreased by an additional million 
in order to reduce the impact on our outstanding shares of holders converting these notes into approximately million shares of common stock  we intend to use available cash that otherwise would have been used to redeem these notes to repurchase a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in the open market 
we currently also expect to use cash to redeem our zero coupon convertible debentures and convertible senior debentures on or subsequent to their call dates may and november  respectively  however  holders of these instruments may convert them into shares of our common stock if the price of such stock exceeds the stipulated thresholds which were not met as of february  or upon the exercise of our call provisions 
we also expect to utilize cash during second quarter to redeem our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
finally  on february   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share 
while we expect to use approximately million of cash to pay dividends in  although no assurances can be made  we anticipate increasing the dividend over time as our earnings and cash flow grow 
financial obligations at december   we had approximately billion of indebtedness including corporate indebtedness of billion  upper decs of million and debt under management and mortgage programs of billion

such gains are partially offset by million of mark to market adjustments on new fair value interest rate hedges 
as of december   the balance represents million of realized gains resulting from the termination of fair value interest rate hedges and million of mark to market adjustments on new fair value interest rate hedges 
the change in our total corporate debt reflects the issuance of billion in notes with maturity dates ranging from five to twelve years  the proceeds of which were primarily used to repurchase debt with nearer term maturities or mandatory redemption provisions 
during  we repurchased repaid approximately billion of our outstanding corporate debt  approximately billion of which was scheduled to mature or potentially become due in notes and zero coupon convertible debentures and million of which was scheduled to potentially become due in november convertible senior debentures 
through these repurchases  we have not only eliminated a significant liquidity need  we also removed million shares of potential dilution from our future earnings per share 
the number of shares of common stock potentially issuable for each of our contingently convertible debt securities is detailed below in millions as of december  as of december  change zero coupon senior convertible contingent notes zero coupon convertible debentures convertible senior debentures as previously discussed  in february  holders of our zero coupon senior convertible contingent notes converted such notes into shares of cd common stock 
we intend to use the cash that otherwise would have been used to redeem these notes to repurchase a corresponding number of shares of cd common stock in the open market 
the senior convertible debentures may be converted prior to maturity during each three month period if the closing sale price of cd common stock exceeds a threshold  which through november  is 
in addition  the holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase the debentures on november   and we have the right to redeem the debentures at any time after such date  in each case at par plus accrued interest  if any 
although no assurances can be given  it is currently our intention to redeem the remaining debentures for cash following such date 
we would expect to have cash on hand  as well as available capacity under our credit facilities in order to fund such redemption 
upon notice of our intent to redeem the debentures  the holders will have the right to convert their debentures  and we would expect holders to exercise such conversion right if the price of cd common stock exceeds per share 
to the extent that holders convert their debentures  we would expect to use amounts intended to fund redemptions to repurchase shares of cd common stock in the open market 
the significant terms for our outstanding debt instruments at december  can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
upper decs because the upper decs obligate holders to purchase shares of our cd common stock at a price determined by the average closing price of cd common stock during a trading day period ending in august  the upper decs are functionally equivalent to issuing shares of cd common stock subject to an issue price collar  with a delay in issuance until at the time of issuance of the upper decs  we believed that the impact of issuing the upper decs would be favorable compared to an equivalent immediate issuance of common stock 
upon settlement of the forward purchase contracts  we expect to issue shares of cd common stock in the range of approximately million to million depending upon the price of cd common stock and to receive gross proceeds in cash of approximately million 
upon maturity of the senior notes that are currently a component of the upper decs in august we would be required to repay million in cash 
the significant terms for the upper decs can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
debt under management and mortgage programs in connection with fin  our debt under management and mortgage programs now reflects the debt issued by bishop s gate  a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity spe that we utilize to warehouse mortgage loans we originate prior to selling them into the secondary market 
additionally  as a result of the adoption of fin r  the debt of aesop funding ii  llc  a bankruptcy remote special purpose limited liability company that we utilize to finance the acquisition of vehicles  which was previously reflected within our debt under management and mortgage programs  is now presented separately on our consolidated balance sheet as related party debt under management and mortgage programs

debt under management and mortgage programs also reflects the debt issued by the sierra entities  which are bankruptcy remote spes that we utilize to securitize timeshare receivables generated from the sale of vacation ownership interests by our timeshare business  and apple ridge  a bankruptcy remote spe that we utilize to securitize relocation receivables generated from advancing funds to clients of our relocation business 
during  the underlying structures of the sierra entities and apple ridge were amended in a manner that resulted in these entities no longer meeting the criteria to qualify as off balance sheet entities 
consequently  we now consolidate these entities and the debt issued is reflected within debt under management and mortgage programs as of december  the following table summarizes the components of our debt under management and mortgage programs including related party debt due to aesop funding as of december  change asset backed debt vehicle rental program aesop funding    other   vehicle management program   mortgage program bishop s gate a   other timeshare program sierra b other relocation program apple ridge c other unsecured debt term notes   commercial paper bank loans other total debt under management and mortgage programs   a as of december   bishop s gate had billion of debt outstanding

we also had million of availability for public debt or equity issuances under a shelf registration statement and our phh subsidiary had an additional million of availability for public debt issuances under a shelf registration statement 
liquidity risk our liquidity position may be negatively affected by unfavorable conditions in any one of the industries in which we operate 
additionally  our liquidity as it relates to both management and mortgage programs could be adversely affected by i the deterioration in the performance of the underlying assets of such programs  ii the impairment of our ability to access the principal financing program for our vehicle rental subsidiaries if general motors corporation or ford motor company should not be able to honor its obligations to repurchase a substantial number of our vehicles and iii our inability to access the secondary market for mortgage loans or certain of our securitization facilities and our inability to act as servicer thereto  which could occur in the event that our or phh s credit ratings are downgraded below investment grade and  in certain circumstances  where we or phh fail to meet certain financial ratios 
further  access to our credit facilities may be limited if we were to fail to meet certain financial ratios 
we do not believe that our or phh s credit ratings are likely to fall below investment grade 
additionally  we monitor the maintenance of required financial ratios and  as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit and securitization facilities 
currently  our credit ratings are as follows moody s investor service standard poor s fitch ratings cendant senior unsecured debt baa bbb bbb phh senior debt baa bbb bbb short term debt p a f all of the above credit ratings  with the exception of those assigned to phh s short term debt  are currently on negative outlook

accounting policies critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
however  events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  the majority of our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
mortgage servicing rights 
a mortgage servicing right is the right to receive a portion of the interest coupon and fees collected from the mortgagor for performing specified mortgage servicing activities 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is estimated based upon an internal valuation that reflects management s estimates of expected future cash flows considering prepayment estimates developed using a third party model described below  our historical prepayment rates  portfolio characteristics  interest rates based on interest rate yield curves and other economic factors 
more specifically  we incorporate a probability weighted option adjusted spread oas model to generate and discount cash flows for the msr valuation 
the oas model generates numerous interest rate paths then calculates the msr cash flow at each monthly point for each interest rate path and discounts those cash flows back to the current period 
the msr value is determined by averaging the discounted cash flows from each of the interest rate paths 
the interest rate paths are generated with a random distribution centered around implied forward interest rates  which are determined from the interest rate yield curve at any given point of time 
as of december   the implied forward interest rates project an increase of approximately basis points in the yield of the year treasury note over the next months 
changes in the yield curve will result in changes to the forward rates implied from that yield curve 
as noted above  a key assumption in our estimate of the msr valuation are forecasted prepayments 
we use a third party model  adjusted to reflect the historical prepayment behavior exhibited by our portfolio  to forecast prepayment rates at each monthly point for each interest rate path in the oas model 
the prepayment forecast is based on historical observations of prepayment behavior in similar circumstances 
the prepayment forecast incorporates loan characteristics eg  loan type and note rate and factors such as recent prepayment experience  previous refinance opportunities and estimated levels of home equity to determine the prepayment forecast at each monthly point for each interest rate path 
to the extent that fair value is less than carrying value at the individual strata level  we would consider the portfolio to have been impaired and record a related charge 
reductions in interest rates different than those used in our models could cause us to use different assumptions in the msr valuation  which could result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our msr asset  requiring a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the asset 
to mitigate this risk  we use derivatives that generally increase in value as interest rates decline and conversely decline in value as interest rates increase 
additionally  as interest rates decrease  we have historically experienced increased production revenue resulting from a greater level of refinancings  which over time has historically mitigated the impact on earnings of the decline in our msr asset 
changes in the estimated fair value of the mortgage servicing rights based upon variations in the assumptions eg  future interest rate levels  prepayment speeds cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear 
changes in one assumption may result in changes to another  which may magnify or counteract the fair value sensitivity analysis and would make such an analysis not meaningful 
additionally  further declines in interest rates due to a weakening economy and geopolitical risks  which result in an increase in refinancing activity or changes in assumptions  could adversely impact the valuation 
during  the interest rate environment caused loans with coupon rates at or below to become a significant component of the company s overall loan servicing portfolio 
therefore  we adjusted the strata of the portfolio during third quarter  which did not have an impact on the msr valuation 
the carrying value of our msr asset was approximately billion as of december  and the total portfolio that we were servicing approximated billion as of december  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the effect of any changes to the value of this asset during and 
the effects of any adverse potential changes in the estimated fair value of our msr asset are detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
financial instruments 
we estimate fair values for each of our financial instruments  including derivative instruments 
most of these financial instruments are not publicly traded on an organized exchange 
in the absence of quoted market prices  we must develop an estimate of fair value using dealer quotes  present value cash flow models  option pricing models or other conventional valuation methods  as appropriate 
the use of these fair value techniques involves significant judgments and assumptions  including estimates of future interest rate levels based on interest rate yield curves  prepayment and volatility factors  and an estimation of the timing of future cash flows 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts recorded in the financial statements  which are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  hedge accounting requires that at the beginning of each hedge period  we justify an expectation that the relationship between the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges compared to changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items be highly effective 
this effectiveness assessment involves an estimation of changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates and corresponding changes in prepayment levels  as well as the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges 
the use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and the underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of the effect of hypothetical changes to these assumptions 
goodwill 
we have reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value and determined that the carrying amount of our reporting units did not exceed their respective fair value 
when determining fair value  we utilized various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
we will continue to review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
we provide a wide range of consumer and business services and  as a result  our goodwill is allocated among many diverse reporting units 
accordingly  it is difficult to quantify the impact of an adverse change in financial results and related cash flows  as such change may be isolated to a small number of our reporting units or spread across our entire organization 
in either case  the magnitude of an impairment to goodwill  if any  cannot be extrapolated 
however  our businesses are concentrated in a few industries and  as such  an adverse change to any of these industries will impact our consolidated results and may result in impairment of our goodwill 
the aggregate carrying value of our goodwill was approximately billion at december  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on goodwill 
changes in accounting policies during on january   we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and all the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
as a result  we changed our accounting policy for stock based compensation using the prospective transition method 
in addition  on january   we adopted the following standards as a result of the issuance of new accounting pronouncements by the fasb in sfas no

  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others on january   the fasb issued fin and on december   the fasb issued a complete replacement of fin  entitled fin revised fin r  which clarifies certain complexities of fin as of september   we had applied the provisions of fin for all transactions initiated subsequent to january  and also to bishop s gate and trilegiant 
we adopted fin r in its entirety as of december  even though adoption for non spes was not required until march  
during  the fasb also issued the following literature  which we have adopted as of july  sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity for more detailed information regarding any of these pronouncements and the impact thereof on our business  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements during  the sec provided interim guidance in a speech pertaining to the measurement of interest rate lock commitments related to loans that will be held for resale commonly referred to as commitments to fund mortgages

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly swap contracts  forward delivery commitments and futures and options contracts to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related specifically to our committed mortgage pipeline  mortgage loan inventory  mortgage servicing rights  mortgage backed securities  debt and certain other interest bearing liabilities 
foreign currency forwards are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables and forecasted royalties  forecasted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and forecasted foreign currency denominated acquisitions 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
more detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in note financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks 
interest rate movements in one country  as well as relative interest rate movements between countries can materially impact our profitability 
our primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically long term us treasury and mortgage interest rates due to their impact on mortgage related assets and commitments and also libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we anticipate that such interest rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
our foreign currency rate exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations in the british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar and euro 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates 
we use a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair values of relocation receivables  timeshare receivables  equity advances on homes  mortgage servicing rights and our retained interests in securitized assets 
the fair value of mortgage loans  commitments to fund mortgages and mortgage backed securities are determined from market sources 
the primary assumptions used in determining fair value are prepayment speeds  estimated loss rates and discount rates 
in determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights  the model also utilizes credit losses and mortgage servicing revenues and expenses as primary assumptions 
in addition  for commitments to fund mortgages  the borrower s propensity to close their mortgage loan under the commitment is used as a primary assumption 
for mortgage loans  commitments to fund mortgages  forward delivery contracts and options  we rely on market sources in determining the impact of interest rate shifts 
we also utilize a probability weighted option adjusted spread oas model to determine the impact of interest rate shifts on mortgage servicing rights and mortgage backed securities 
the primary assumption in an oas model is the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds and the same primary assumptions are used in determining fair value 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt portfolio  certain other interest bearing liabilities and interest rate derivatives portfolios 
the primary assumption used in these models is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 
we use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of the us dollar on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and derivatives 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against all our currency exposures at december   and our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we used december   and market rates on our instruments to perform the sensitivity analyses separately for each of our market risk exposures interest and currency rate instruments 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates 
we have determined that the impact of a change in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and prices on our earnings  fair values and cash flows would not be material 
while these results may be used as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts
