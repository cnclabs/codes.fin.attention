financial information appearing throughout this annual report is consistent with that reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion is designed to assist readers of the consolidated financial statements in understanding significant changes in premier s financial condition and results of operations 
management s objective of a fair presentation of financial information is achieved through a system of internal accounting controls 
the financial control system of premier is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded from loss and that transactions are properly authorized and recorded in the financial records 
as an integral part of that financial control system  the audit committee of the board of directors engaged arnett foster  cpa s to perform internal audits of the financial records of each of the subsidiaries on a periodic basis 
their findings and recommendations are reported to premier s audit committee as well as the audit committees of the subsidiaries

the activities of both the internal and external audit functions are reviewed by the audit committee of the board of directors 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  such performance involves risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these important factors include  but are not limited to  economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which premier operates  competition for premier s customers from other providers of financial services  government legislation and regulation which changes from time to time  changes in interest rates  premier s ability to originate quality loans  collect delinquent loans and attract and retain deposits  the impact of premier s growth  premier s ability to control costs  and new accounting pronouncements  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of premier 
critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
see also note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this annual report 
allowance for loan losses the company monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the company maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of control over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
the company evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management including loans graded as substandard or doubtful by the internal credit review process 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the company makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of probable incurred loan losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of the company as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses exceeds the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses were below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
the company recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable incurred losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill as required by applicable accounting guidance  goodwill is evaluated at least annually to determine if the amount recorded on the company s balance sheet is impaired 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  the recorded amount would be reduced to estimated fair value by a charge to expense in the period in which impairment is determined 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for all of the company s banking operations 
operating characteristics of the aggregate banking operations are derived and compared to a database of peer group banks that have been sold 
pricing valuation factors that are considered in estimating the fair value of the company s aggregate banking operations include price to total assets  price to total book value  price to deposits and price to earnings 
unusual events that have impacted the operating characteristics of the company s aggregate banking operations are considered to assess the likelihood of recurrence and adjustments to historical performance may be made 
changes in assumptions regarding the likelihood of unusual historical events recurring or the use of different pricing valuation factors could have a material impact on management s impairment analysis 
realization of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  computed using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
deferred tax assets for the company primarily relate to the allowance for loan losses and net operating loss carryforwards 
in considering the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized  management considers the amount of previously paid taxes that may be recoverable and the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to fully utilized expected future tax deductions 
at december  management s consideration of the need for a valuation allowance focused on the generation of future taxable income as all available previously paid taxes are expected to be recovered from the operating loss reported in in determining the likelihood of generating future taxable income management considered unusual events that have impacted the company s historical earnings and whether these events will recur  the company s operating budget and likely operating results in the near term and the taxable gain expected to be realized from the sale of the discontinued operation 
changes in these assumptions could impact the carrying value of deferred tax assets and require a charge to tax expense 
significant event arising in on june   premier announced that as a result of an ongoing internal investigation it had uncovered a systematic disregard for its loan approval and credit administration policies at its wholly owned subsidiary farmers deposit bank and had accepted the resignation of the bank s president 
on june   senior management of premier received from the bank s former president a request to charge off over million in loans 
concerned about the magnitude of the request and the impact of premier s financial results  premier management promptly notified the federal reserve bank of cleveland and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic about the request 
premier s initial investigation indicated that the former president of farmers deposit had engaged in conduct which subverted the bank s internal controls and credit administration policies  conduct which appears to have been designed to avoid detection by management and those entities employed by premier to perform independent reviews of its subsidiaries accounting records  internal controls  and credit risk 
as a result of the ongoing investigation into the conduct of the former president of farmers deposit by premier and the fdic  premier charged off over million of loans 
the resulting depletion of the allowance for loan losses together with the current analysis of additional risk in the loan portfolio warranted significant additional provisions for loan losses at the bank 
in addition to the provision for loan losses  interest income reversals and other non interest expenses including bad check write offs and loan review expenses were recorded 
premier s management  with the assistance of outside independent professionals  has conducted a further review of those loans for which significant charge offs or additional provisions were required in the purpose of this review was to determine if the facts or circumstances that gave rise to additional charge offs or provisions had been improperly withheld from senior management or improperly considered in applying management s estimates and judgments as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in prior financial statement periods 
the review did identify instances in which collateral securing loans had been released without proper support or notation in loan files  instances in which obligors on notes had been released from their repayment obligation without proper support or notation in loan files and instances in which delinquent loan reporting systems had been manipulated to prevent problem loans from being identified on a timely basis 
premier s senior management determined that if these circumstances had been considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in prior periods then some of the loan charge offs and additional provisions for loan losses recorded in should have been reflected in prior periods 
therefore the financial statements for and have been restated to reflect the financial statement effect of the matters that occurred in those periods but which were improperly concealed by subsidiary management 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the impact of the restatement of and the tables and discussion below reflect the effect of this restatement 
summary financial results premier net results from continuing operations for were a loss of million  compared to a loss from continuing operations of million reported for the year the loss for is primarily due to large provisions for loan losses and bad check losses at its subsidiary  farmers deposit bank 
the million loss in was due to large provisions for loan losses  writedowns of repossessed real estate to realizable values  and higher collection costs 
the loss in follows million of income from continuing operations reported for the year ending december  basic earnings per share from continuing operations was a loss of in  compared to a loss of per share in and income of in the following table comparatively illustrates the components of roa and roe over the previous five years 
return on average assets roa measures how effectively premier utilizes its assets to produce net income 
premier s operating loss for resulted in a roa of  a decrease from the roa reported in and the roa in as shown in the table  the decrease in roa from years and earlier is attributed primarily to an increase in the provision for loan losses  resulting in negative net credit income 
the decrease in roa in versus the years and earlier is primarily due to a decline in net credit income again resulting from the high provisions for loan losses in a portion of the decline in net credit income was offset by the gain on the sale of banking subsidiaries reported in as illustrated in the table  premier s fully taxable net interest income as a percent of average earning assets was down slightly to from the recorded in and interest earned on loans declined due to a lower balance of loans outstanding 
during the same time of declining net credit income  premier has reduced its operating costs 
the net overhead ratio non interest expense less non interest income as a percent of average earning assets declined to in  the lowest ratio reported in the five years presented in the table 
the net overhead ratio compares to in and in the decline in net overhead was the result increases in non interest income related to service charges on deposit accounts

on february   the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell citizens bank in a cash transaction valued at approximately  the sale of this subsidiary would help to restore the financial position of premier after the impact of the losses sustained at farmers deposit bank during the second and third quarters of management anticipates that the sale  if affected  will restore the regulatory capital ratios of premier to the stronger levels it wishes to maintain  will more than replenish the cash reserves of the holding company used to recapitalize farmers deposit bank  and will allow premier to utilize its federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards in a more timely manner 
the sale is anticipated to close early in the third quarter of in premier suspended its acquisition strategy in order to focus on improving its subsidiary bank operations by strengthening its management oversight 
as part of this change in strategy  premier elected to dispose of two of its subsidiary banks in on january   the company disposed of all the deposits approximately million  the majority of loans approximately million and the premises and equipment approximately million of the bank of mt 
vernon under the terms of a purchase and assumption agreement 
as a result of this transaction  the banking charter of the bank of mt 
vernon was relinquished and premier agreed not to compete in the markets previously served by the bank of mt 
vernon 
also  on december   the company disposed of certain assets and liabilities of the sabina bank 
the sale included all the loans approximately million and all the deposits approximately million  as well as the premises and equipment approximately million 
certain assets of the bank were retained by premier pending liquidation of the bank  which occurred in the operating results of both the bank of mount vernon and the sabina bank were included in premier s operating results through the respective dates of the sale 
however  the and operating results do not include any of the operations of these two banks

balance sheet analysis summary a financial institution s primary sources of revenue are generated by its earning assets  while its major expenses are produced by the funding of these assets with interest bearing liabilities

in  average earning assets declined by or million from  following a or million decline in from average interest bearing liabilities  the primary source of funds supporting the earning assets  decreased or million from  which follows a or million decline in from the decline in the average earning assets was the result of million of loan charge offs  primarily at farmers deposit  coupled with loan maturities and principal pay downs that were not renewed 
the decline in interest bearing liabilities was largely due to debt reduction strategies and a shift in customer deposits from interest bearing to non interest bearing 
approximately three fourths of the decrease in average earning assets and slightly less than two thirds of the decrease in average interest bearing liabilities was due to the sale of the sabina bank late in additional information on each of the components of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is contained in the following sections of this report 
loan portfolio premier s loan portfolio is its largest and highest yielding component of average earning assets  totaling of average earning assets during average loans declined by million or in the decline is partially attributed to the high level of charge offs  primarily at farmers deposit but also to stiffer competition from larger banks competing in premier s markets and a general decline in economic growth 
of the total decline  premier realized a increase in loans in its west virginia markets and a increase in loans in its ohio markets 
these were more than offset by a decline in loans in premier s kentucky markets  primarily commercial loans 
due to the low interest rate environment  many borrowers sought to refinance their loans to reduce their interest costs 
due to the lack luster economy and the resulting lower demand for loans  larger banks began competing more strongly by enticing borrowers with prime rate or below prime rate loans 
therefore  scheduled maturities were not necessarily renewed 
approximately of the decline in was the result of the sale of the sabina bank in late of the remaining decline  premier realized an increase in loans in its west virginia markets and a increase in loans in its ohio markets  both primarily in real estate mortgage loans 
these were offset by a decline in loans in premier s kentucky markets 
total loans at december   decreased by million or over the total at december  this decrease follows an million or decrease in from total loans at december  the decline in period end loans was the result of the million of loan charge off recorded during the year  primarily at farmers deposit  and declines due to low loan demand resulting from the poor economy and heavy refinancing activity by borrowers to obtain lower interest rates 
the decrease in was the result of planned collections of loans retained from the bank of mt 
vernon sale as well as declines in period end loans at premier s kentucky affiliates 
the following table presents a five year comparison of loans by type 
with the exception of those categories included in the comparison  there are no loan concentrations which exceed of total loans 
additionally  premier s loan portfolio contains no loans to foreign borrowers nor does it have a material volume of highly leveraged transaction lending 
loan summary dollars in thousands as of december summary of loans by type commercial  secured by real estate      commercial  other      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      agricultural      consumer      other    total loans      less unearned income total loans net of unearned income      non performing assets non accrual loans      accruing loans which are contractually past due days or more      restructured loans total nonperforming and restructured loans      other real estate acquired through foreclosures      total nonperforming and restructured loans and other real estate      nonperforming and restructured loans as a of total loans nonperforming and restructured loans and other real estate as a of total assets allocation of allowance for loan losses commercial  other      real estate  construction real estate  other      consumer installment    unallocated     total      from continuing operations loans secured by real estate  which in total constituted approximately of premier s loan portfolio at december   consist of a diverse portfolio of predominately single family residential loans and loans for commercial purposes where real estate is part of the collateral  not the primary source of repayment 
residential real estate mortgage loans generally do not exceed of the value of the real property securing the loan 
the residential real estate mortgage loan portfolio primarily consists of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans 
the origination of these mortgage loans can be more difficult in a low interest rate environment where there is a significant demand for fixed rate mortgages 
premier also participates in the solicitation of loans for the secondary market and recognizes the referral fees in non interest income 
commercial loans are generally made to small to medium size businesses located within a defined market area and typically are secured by business assets and guarantees of the principal owners 
additional risks of loss are associated with commercial lending such as the potential for adverse changes in economic conditions or the borrowers ability to successfully execute their business plan 
consumer loans generally are made to individuals living in premier s defined market area who are known to the local bank s staff 
consumer loans are generally made for terms of up to seven years on a secured or unsecured basis  however longer terms may be approved in certain circumstances and for revolving credit lines 
while consumer loans generally provide the company with increased interest income  consumer loans may involve a greater risk of default 
in addition to the loans presented in the loan summary table  premier also offers certain off balance sheet products such as letters of credit  revolving credit agreements  and other loan commitments 
these products are offered under the same credit standards as the loan portfolio and are included in the risk based capital ratios used by the federal reserve to evaluate capital adequacy 
additional information on off balance sheet commitments is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
total non performing assets  which consist of past due loans on which interest is not being accrued non accrual loans  foreclosed properties in the process of liquidation oreo  loans with restructured terms to enable a delinquent borrower to repay and accruing loans past due days or more  were million or of total assets of continuing operations at year end the amount is up significantly from the million of non performing assets of total assets of continuing operations at year end and the million of non performing assets of total assets of continuing operations at year end the increase in was due to the loan underwriting issues uncovered at farmers deposit bank 
as management s efforts to collect these loans upon maturity continues  loans are only renewed using premier s strengthened credit policies 
otherwise  loans may be placed on non accrual status and foreclosure proceeding begun to obtain and liquidate any collateral securing the past due or matured loans 
premier is committed to reducing its high level of non performing assets and implementing strong underwriting standards to help reduce the level of non performing assets in the future 
this effort is revealed in the decline in non performing assets from the end of to the end of  primarily related to the sale of oreo properties and the decline in loans days past due 
premier s efforts at its other affiliate banks in are masked by the high level of non performing assets at farmers deposit bank  which alone totaled million at december  the loan summary table presents five years of comparative non performing asset information 
it is premier s policy to place loans that are past due over days on non accrual status  unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
premier had no commitments to provide additional funds on non accrual loans at december  for real estate loans  upon repossession  the balance of the loan is transferred to other real estate owned oreo and carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or the fair value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends less estimated disposal costs 
if a writedown of the oreo property is necessary at the time of foreclosure  the amount is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
a periodic review of the recorded property value is performed in conjunction with normal loan reviews  and if market conditions indicate that the recorded value exceeds the fair market value less estimated disposal costs  additional writedowns of the property value are charged directly to operations 
during premier recognized  of oreo writedowns compared to million in and  in although loans may be classified as non performing  some continue to pay interest irregularly or at less than original contracted terms 
during  approximately  of interest was recognized on non accrual and restructured loans  while approximately  would have been recognized in accordance with their original terms 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable incurred losses associated with lending activities 
actual losses are charged against the allowance charge offs while collections on loans previously charged off recoveries are added back to the allowance 
since actual losses within a given loan portfolio are difficult to predict  management uses a significant amount of estimation and judgment to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include an individual assessment of risk on certain loans and total creditor relationships  historical charge off experience  the type of loan  levels of non performing and past due loans  and an evaluation of current economic conditions 
loans are evaluated for credit risk and assigned a risk grade 
premier s risk grading criteria are based upon federal reserve guidelines and definitions 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  loans that are assigned passing grades are grouped together and multiplied by historical charge off percentages to determine an estimated amount of potential losses and a corresponding amount of allowance 
loans that are assigned marginally passing grades are grouped together and allocated slightly higher percentages to determine the estimated amount of potential losses due to the identification of increased risk s 
loans that are assigned a grade of substandard or doubtful are usually determined to be impaired 
a loan is categorized and reported as impaired when it is probable that the creditor will be unable to pay all of the principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in determining whether a loan is impaired  management considers such factors as past payment history  recent economic events  current and projected financial condition and other relevant information that is available at the time 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual basis for other loans 
if a loan is deemed to be impaired an evaluation of the amount of estimated loss is performed assessing the present value of estimated future cashflows using the loan s existing rate or assessing the fair and realizable value of the loan collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the estimation of loss is assigned to the impaired loan and is used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for impaired loans  this estimation of loss is reevaluated quarterly and  if necessary  adjusted based upon the current known facts and circumstances related to the loan and the borrower 
additional information on premier s impaired loans is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the sum of the calculations and estimations of the risk of loss in a given loan portfolio is compared to the recorded balance of the allowance for loan losses 
if the total allowance is deemed to be inadequate a charge to earnings is recorded to increase the allowance 
conversely  should an evaluation of the allowance result in a lower estimate of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio and the allowance is deemed to be more than adequate  a reversal of previous charges to earnings a negative provision may be warranted in the current period 
events that may lead to negative provisions included greater than anticipated recoveries  securing more collateral on an impaired loan during the collection process  or receiving payment in full on an impaired loan 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million or of total year end loans 
this ratio is an increase from the prior year s and the at the end of  due to the significant allowance attributed to the loans at farmers deposit bank 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb the current estimated risk of loss in the existing loan portfolio 
the summary of the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan type is presented in the loan summary table above 
the following table provides a detailed history of the allowance for loan losses  illustrating charge offs and recoveries by loan type  and the annual provision for loan losses over the past five years 
the provision for loan losses in was million  up significantly from the million provision in and the million provision in the high level of provision in was the result of the net charge offs and increase in impaired loans at farmers deposit 
the relatively high provisions in was in response to management efforts to identify the level of probable incurred losses throughout premier s troubled institutions using the best practices of its higher performing institutions 
these efforts were circumvented or rendered ineffective by the disregard for controls by the former president of farmers deposit 
the large provision in was in response to the higher risk in certain loans retained by premier as part of the sale of the bank of mt 
vernon and a higher level of net charge off experience 
premier continually evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses  and changes in the provision are based on the estimated probable incurred loss of the loan portfolio

while the level of commercial loans charged off was relatively comparable to  there were significant increases in consumer and real estate loan charge offs 
the million of net charge offs in was a slight decrease from the million of net charge offs in although management believes it has identified the significant remaining credit risk in the loan portfolio  additional charge offs may be recorded in the coming months due to the high level of non performing loans and the resolution of collection efforts on those loans 
these factors are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which at december  was of total loans outstanding and of non performing loans

investment portfolio and other earning assets investment securities averaged million in  a million or increase from the million averaged in this increase follows a decrease from the million averaged in the increase in average investments in was the result of weak loan demand and stiffer competition from large banks in premier s markets 
in  funds from loan payoffs and maturities were therefore not used to fund new loans but were instead invested in high quality debt securities 
over half of the decrease in was a result of the sale of the sabina bank late in the remaining decrease in was the result of placing funds from maturing investments in federal funds sold to maintain adequate liquidity for planned maturities of high rate certificates of deposit 
as shown in the rate volume analysis table below  significant interest savings were realized on certificates of deposit in and due to declines in interest rates paid and the volume of certificates on deposit

premier s average investment in federal funds sold and other short term investments increased by in this follows a decrease in averaging million in  federal funds sold and other short term investments increased million from the million averaged in  and were higher than the million averaged during the increase in average federal funds sold in was the result of maintaining additional liquidity at farmers deposit bank and the desire to keep more liquid funds on hand to take advantage of any potential rising interest rates 
fluctuations in federal funds sold and other short term investments reflect management s goal to maximize asset yields while maintaining proper asset liability structure  as discussed in greater detail above and in other sections of this report 
funding sources in  premier once again decreased the rates paid on its interest bearing deposits in response to the decline in market interest rates 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to in  down from the paid in and the paid in the decrease is largely due to declines in rates paid on time deposits as higher rate certificates of deposits have either not renewed at maturity or were redeposited at significantly lower rates in conjunction with the decline in market interest rates 
similarly  rates paid on now and money market transactional deposit accounts also declined 
due to alternative sources of investment and an ever increasing sophistication of customers in funds management techniques to maximize return on their money  competition for funds has become more intense 
premier s banks periodically offer special rate products to attract additional deposits 
premier s deposits  on average  decreased by or million in the decrease follows a or million decrease in from the average in million or approximately of the decrease was the result of the sale of the sabina bank late in in  non interest bearing deposits increased by or million on average when compared to the non interest bearing deposits sold through the sale of the sabina bank late in more than offset the increase in average non interest bearing deposits from internal growth during in  interest bearing deposits decreased by or million on average when compared to the decrease was primarily the result of planned non renewals of high rate time deposits which more than offset increases in average interest bearing transaction deposits and savings deposits 
in  interest bearing deposits decreased by or million 
approximately half of the decrease was the result of the sale of the sabina bank late in similar to  the remaining million decrease was primarily the result of planned non renewals of high rate time deposits which more than offset increases in average interest bearing transaction deposits and savings deposits

premier s short term borrowings primarily consist of federal funds purchased from other banks  and securities sold under agreements to repurchase with commercial customers 
these short term borrowings fluctuate depending on near term funding needs and as part of premier s management of its asset liability mix 
in  short term borrowings averaged million  down  from the average in the decline in was largely the result of terminating the repurchase agreements at farmers deposit bank in an effort to reduce the size of the bank 
in  short term borrowings declined by million on average 
only about one eighth of the decline was the result of the sabina bank sale 
the remaining decline was due to reduced short term funding needs at the affiliate banks 
long term borrowings consist of federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings by premier s banks  other borrowings by the parent holding company and debt issued in the form of subordinated debentures to an unconsolidated trust subsidiary 
fhlb advances  on average  declined by or million in  following a or million decrease in premier uses fixed rate fhlb advances from time to time to fund certain residential and commercial loans as well to maximize investment opportunities as part of its interest rate risk management 
in  premier elected not to renew most of its maturing fhlb advances and prepaid a limited number of other fhlb advances 
at december   fhlb advances totaled million and had repayment schedules from one to nine years 
other borrowings  on average  declined by or million in and or million in as the parent company began using available funds to aggressively pay down its outstanding debt late in at december   other borrowings totaled million with scheduled maturities in management anticipates that the remaining balance of these borrowings will be renewed under similar interest and repayment terms

payments due on contractual obligations december  in thousands less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years fhlb advances      other borrowed funds   notes payable   guaranteed subordinated debentures   operating lease obligations total      premier s trust preferred securities represent beneficial interests in the assets of pfbi capital trust nasdaq nms pfbip 
the trust holds million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures subordinated debentures due in quarterly cash distributions on the preferred securities are made to the extent interest on the debentures is received by the trust 
as previously disclosed  pursuant to an agreement entered into with the federal reserve bank of cleveland on september  as superceded by an agreement with the federal reserve bank of cleveland dated january   premier is required to request approval for the payment of distributions due on the trust preferred securities 
during the quarter ended june   premier was notified by the federal reserve bank of cleveland that due to the deterioration of core earnings of the company  among other issues  the frb would not allow the payment of the distribution due june  on premier s trust preferred securities 
in response  premier reached an agreement with the federal reserve bank of cleveland whereby premier s chairman of the board  who is also its largest shareholder  agreed to loan the company the amount of the distribution   so that premier  with the federal reserve bank s approval  could make the distribution 
the loan is unsecured at a zero interest rate with no defined maturity date 
the loan cannot be repaid without the prior approval of the federal reserve bank 
a similar agreement was reached with for the payment of the distribution due september  premier s president and chief executive officer  who is also a director  agreed to loan the company the amount of the distribution   this loan is also unsecured at a zero interest rate with no defined maturity date 
the loan also cannot be repaid without the prior approval of the federal reserve bank of cleveland 
in december  the federal reserve bank of cleveland denied premier s request to make the fourth quarter distribution 
accordingly  premier exercised its right to defer the payment of interest on the subordinated debentures related to the trust preferred securities for an indefinite period which can be no longer than consecutive quarterly periods 
premier continued to defer this payment of interest throughout and the first quarter of these and any future deferred distributions accrue interest at an annual rate of which will be paid when the deferred distributions are ultimately paid 
management of premier does not expect to resume payments on the subordinated debentures or the trust preferred securities until the federal reserve bank of cleveland determines that premier has achieved adequate and sustained levels of profitability to support such payments and approves such payments 
the trust preferred securities have a cumulative provision 
therefore  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  premier intends to continue to accrue the monthly cost of the trust preferred securities as it has since issuance 
premier s management also intends to continue to seek approval of the federal reserve bank of cleveland for payment of the regularly scheduled quarterly distributions on the trust preferred securities and any accumulated deferrals once it believes premier has achieved the adequate and sustained levels of profitability desired by the federal reserve 
as part of a debt reduction and profitability plan presented on january  to the federal reserve bank of cleveland federal reserve  premier requested and received approval from the federal reserve to redeem  of the then outstanding  trust preferred securities 
the goal of the redemption was to use a portion of premier s cash on hand to reduce its total interest cost and thus improve profitability 
the redemption reduced premier s interest cost by approximately  per year 
however  this benefit was partially offset due to the interest accrued in on the deferred quarterly distributions 
future early redemptions  if any  will also require federal reserve approval  pursuant to a previously disclosed written agreement entered into with the federal reserve bank of cleveland on january   asset liability management and market risk asset liability management is a means of maximizing net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk by planning and controlling the mix and maturities of interest related assets and liabilities 
premier has established an asset liability management committee alco for the purpose of monitoring and managing interest rate risk and to evaluate investment portfolio strategies 
interest rate risk is the earnings variation that could occur due to changes in market interest rates 
the board of directors has established policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
premier monitors its interest rate risk through the use of an earnings simulation model prepared by an independent third party to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
the earnings simulation model uses assumptions  maturity patterns  and reinvestment rates provided by premier and forecasts the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net interest income would increase by approximately over the projected stable rate net interest income if interest rates rise by basis points over the next year 
conversely  the simulation projects an approximate decrease in net interest income if interest rates fall by basis points over the next year 
within the same time frame  but assuming a basis point movement in interest rates  the simulation projects that net interest income would increase by over the projected stable rate net interest income in a rising rate scenario and would decrease by in a falling rate scenario 
under both the and basis point simulations  the percentage changes in net interest income are within premier s alco guidelines 
another measure of a company s interest sensitivity is the measure of economic value at risk evr 
the evr of a company s balance sheet at a given point in time is the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows 
similar to net interest income  evr can be simulated assuming changes in market interest rates 
the resulting percentage change versus the stable rate evr is an indication of the longer term repricing risk imbedded in the balance sheet 
at december   a basis point increase in rates is estimated to decrease premier s evr by while a basis point decrease would increase premier s evr by 
the percentage changes in evr for the basis point decrease are outside premier s alco guidelines 
however  the with market interest rates already at relatively low levels  the likelihood of an additional basis point decrease is believed to be remote 
furthermore  the low interest rate environment in limits the change in the market value of liabilities in a declining rate simulation because rates paid on liabilities cannot fall below zero 
the model simulation calculations of present value have certain acceptable shortcomings 
the discount rates and prepayment assumptions utilized are based on estimated market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide 
the unique characteristics of premier s loans and securities may not necessarily parallel those assumed in the model simulations  and therefore  actual results could likely result in different discount rates  prepayment experiences and present values 
the discount rates used for deposits and borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which may not necessarily be indicative of the present value of premier s deposits and borrowings 
premier s deposits have customer relationship advantages that are difficult to simulate 
a higher or lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment and borrowing strategies by premier which would be designed to further mitigate any negative effects on the value of  and the net interest earnings generated on premier s net assets

liquidity liquidity is the ability to satisfy demands for deposit withdrawals  lending commitments  and other corporate needs 
premier s liquidity is based on the stable nature of consumer core deposits held by the banking subsidiaries 
likewise  additional liquidity is available from holdings of investment securities and short term investments which can be readily converted into cash 
furthermore  premier s banks continue to have the ability to attract short term sources of funds such as federal funds and repurchase agreements 
premier generated million of cash from operations in  which compares to million in and million in these proceeds along with the proceeds from the sale and maturity of securities and the repayment of loans were used to purchase securities  satisfy deposit withdrawals  and reduce outstanding debt during those years 
net cash provided by liquidating investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in net cash used to satisfy deposit withdrawals and reduce debt totaled million in  million in and million in details on the sources and uses of cash can be found in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the parent company had nearly million in cash held with its subsidiary banks 
this balance along with cash dividends expected to be received from its subsidiaries is sufficient to cover the operating costs of the parent  service its existing other debt and to provide additional capital to farmers deposit bank as outlined in premier s capital restoration plan submitted to the fdic 
during  the parent company used a significant portion of its cash reserves to call million of the trust preferred securities outstanding and to invest additional capital in farmers deposit bank to meet minimum capital ratios required by the fdic 
it is anticipated that the sale of citizens bank for approximately million in cash early in the third quarter of will more than restore the cash reserves used during additional information on parent company cash flows and financial statements is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital resources premier s consolidated average equity to asset ratio remained healthy at during  down slightly from the during  but up from the during the decrease in was largely the result of the losses sustained during the year resulting from the operations of farmers deposit bank 
the increase in primarily resulted from a decrease in total assets resulting from the sale of the sabina bank in late without a corresponding decrease in equity 
the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratio measure the capital adequacy of banking institutions 
the risk based capital guidelines weight balance sheet assets and off balance sheet commitments by prescribed factors relative to credit risk  thus eliminating disincentives for holding low risk assets and requiring more capital for holding higher risk assets 
at year end  premier s risk adjusted capital to assets ratio was compared to at december  both of these ratios are well above the minimum level of prescribed for bank holding companies of premier s size 
the leverage ratio is a measure of total tangible equity to total tangible assets 
premier s leverage ratio at december  was compared to at december  both of these ratios are above the recommended to recommended by the federal reserve 
the decline in the ratios was again the result of the reduction in total capital  a result of the losses sustained during the year  compounded by an increase in disallowed deferred tax assets 
in accordance with federal reserve guidelines for all banks and bank holding companies  deferred tax assets are subtracted from premier s available total equity disallowed if they generally cannot be realized through available tax refunds in a next twelve month timeframe 
it is anticipated the sale of citizens bank will not only reduce the overall assets of premier and thus improve its equity to asset ratios  but will also generate taxable income that can be used to realize a portion of premier s disallowed deferred tax assets 
premier s healthy capital ratios are the direct result of management s desire to maintain a strong capital position 
additional information on premier s capital ratios and the capital ratios of its larger banks may be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the primary source of funds for dividends paid by premier to its shareholders is the dividends received from its subsidiary banks 
banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the regulatory agencies 
under these regulations  the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval in any calendar year is limited to the current year s net profits  as defined  combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years  subject to regulatory capital requirements and additional restrictions more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  premier s banks could  without prior approval  declare and pay to premier dividends of approximately million plus any net profits retained through the date of declaration by ohio river bank  boone county bank and first central bank

net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis was million in  down from the amount earned in which follows a decrease in from when net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis  interest income from tax exempt earning assets is increased by the amount equivalent to the federal income taxes which would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutory federal tax rate of for companies of premier s size 
the decrease in net interest income in is largely due to a decrease in the volume of assets and liabilities coupled with a decline in interest income resulting from the high level of non accrual loans at farmers deposit 
as shown in the rate volume analysis table below  decreases in the volume of earning assets in reduced premier s interest income by million 
this decrease was partially offset by the lower volume of interest bearing liabilities in resulting in a million decline in interest expense 
the net effect was to reduce net interest income by  for the year 
similarly  the lower interest rate environment in  coupled with the reversal of interest income for loans placed on non accrual during the year resulted in reduced interest income of million 
this decline was partially offset by reduced interest expense of million which resulted from the lower interest rate environment 
the combined result was an overall decrease in net interest income of million 
however  premier s management of changes in interest rates risk and its ability to lower the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities more rapidly than the declines in yields on interest earning assets resulted in an increase in net interest income from rate movements of million for the year this increase only partially offset the million decline in net interest income due to lower volumes resulting in the overall decline in net interest income 
similarly  in  a reduction in premier s volume of earning assets reduced interest income by million which was only partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense due to a lower volume of interest bearing liabilities 
the net result was a million decrease in net interest income from volume activity 
in contrast to however  in  premier s management of changes in interest rates risk and its ability to lower the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities more rapidly than the declines in yields on interest earning assets resulted in an increase in net interest income from rate movements of million for the year 
this increase only partially offset the million decline in net interest income due to lower volumes resulting in the overall  decline in net interest income

the net result on all earning assets was to reduce the yield basis points to in  down from earned in and earned in similarly  in premier reduced the average rate paid on its deposits by basis points by not renewing a significant amount of high rate certificates of deposit and by keeping the rates paid on other deposit products competitive with national and local market rates 
the net result on all interest bearing liabilities was to reduce the cost of funds basis points to  down from in and in as a result  premier s net interest spread decreased by basis points and its net interest margin decreased by basis points to in  down from in and in further discussion of net interest income is included in the section of this report entitled balance sheet analysis 
non interest income and expense non interest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for improving profitability 
recognizing this importance  management continues to evaluate areas where non interest income can be enhanced 
as shown in the table of non interest income and expense below  total fees and other income increased by or  in the increase in is largely due to increases in service charges on deposit accounts 
in  total fees and other income decreased by or  from approximately of the decline was due to the sale of the operations of the bank of mount vernon and the sabina bank in the remaining decrease was due to declines in other income which were only partially offset by increases in revenue from service charges on deposit accounts 
service charges on deposit accounts increased to  in  an increase of or  the increase is a result of changes in the way premier charges customers for over drawing their checking accounts and a general increase in customers and activity 
the increase follows a or  increase over after factoring out the services charges earned by the two banks that were sold in  service charges in increased by or  over insurance commissions declined by or  in largely due to lower new loan generations resulting from lower loan demand and stiffer competition from larger banks 
this decrease follows a increase in over other income increased by or  in this is a result of increases in various other sources of income such as debit card fees  commissions from originating secondary market mortgage loans and collections of loans retained from the bank of mt 
vernon and sabina bank sales 
other income declined by  in largely due to the other income reported by the two banks that were sold in and reduced income from origination and sales of mortgage loans in the secondary market 
in  premier realized  in net gains on securities sales 
these securities were sold as part of premier s management of its asset liability position and to liquidate the tax exempt investments at farmers deposit bank in order to generate taxable income in the future 
in  premier realized  in net losses on securities sales  which compares to  in net gains realized in in  premier recognized gains of million on the sale of two subsidiary banking operations

premier s net overhead ratio  or non interest expense less non interest income excluding securities transactions and other similar non operating transactions to average earning assets was  a decrease decrease from the realized in and the ratio realized in for the year  net overhead was million  a decrease of  or below the overhead of million 
the decline in premier s net overhead ratio is a result of the increase in non interest income discussed above combined with a decrease in non interest expense discussed below 
the current year decrease follows a decrease in of or million from the overhead of million 
approximately million of this decrease was the net overhead of the bank of mount vernon and the sabina bank recognized in whose operations were not included in premier s results for a lower net overhead ratio means more of the net interest margin flows through as net income 
total non interest expense in decreased by  or from as decreases in staff costs  oreo losses and expenses and taxes not on income were only partially offset by increases in professional fees  bad check losses and other expenses 
this year s decrease compares to a million or decrease in versus approximately million of the decline was due to the sale of the operations of the bank of mount vernon and the sabina bank in the remainder was due to a  or decline in the non interest expenses of the remaining operations as described in more detail below 
staff costs decreased by  or in versus increases is salaries and wages were more than offset by reductions in medical insurance benefit costs 
in the second quarter of  employees were required to contribute a percentage of the overall premium as premier changed its benefit structure to be more in line with its competitors 
the percentage of employee contribution is being phased in over a two year period 
in  staff costs decreased by million largely due to the sale of the banking operations in the remainder was largely due to a  decrease in staff costs at the parent holding company  offset by normal salary adjustments at the subsidiary banks 
occupancy and equipment expenses decreased by  or in as decreases in equipment expenses were substantially offset by an increase in occupancy costs 
in  occupancy and equipment expense decreased by  or from approximately  of occupancy and equipment expenses was eliminated due to the sale of the banking operations in the remaining  or increase was largely due to increases in property taxes and maintenance costs on buildings and equipment 
professional fees increased by  or in versus the increase in was largely due to legal and audit costs related to the farmers deposit bank investigation 
this increase follows a  or increase in versus approximately  of professional fees were eliminated due to the sale of the banking operations in the remaining  increase was largely due to increased legal fees related to collections  regulatory and compliance matters  other legal matters  and fees related to external audits and premier s efforts to strengthen its internal control processes 
taxes not on income decreased by  or in versus the decrease in is largely due to employment of tax saving strategies resulting from the moving of the company headquarters to west virginia 
in  taxes not on income declined by  or 
approximately  of taxes not on income were eliminated due to the sale of the banking operations in the remaining  increase was due to increases in the amount of equity subject to equity based taxes 
oreo writedowns and expenses totaled  in  a decrease of  or from the million of these expenses in the increase in was largely due to writedowns of oreo property to net realizable values as management emphasized efforts to liquidate the properties 
bad check losses totaled  in  a  increase from the  recorded in the increase in was primarily the result of bad checks losses at farmers deposit bank related to dishonored checks discovered during investigation 
the collection of these checks is still being pursued by the bank 
in  premier adopted financial accounting statements fas and the effect of adopting these new accounting standards has been the elimination of the amortization of goodwill effective january in  premier recognized million of goodwill amortization 
additional information concerning premier s adoption of fas and is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements

applicable income taxes premier recognized a million income tax benefit in compared to million income tax benefit in and million of income tax expense in premier s effective tax rate was in  down from in and the in the benefit in and was due to the pretax losses realized by premier 
premier s effective tax rate in and was increased by the benefits of holding tax exempt investments and other tax saving instruments 
the increase in taxes as well as the increased effective tax rate was due to the gains on the sales of the two banking subsidiaries and the taxability of those transactions 
additional information regarding income taxes is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of changing prices the results of operations and financial condition presented in this report are based on historical cost  unadjusted for the effects of inflation 
inflation affects premier in two ways 
one is that inflation can result in increased operating costs which must be absorbed or recovered through increased prices for services 
the second effect is on the purchasing power of the corporation 
virtually all of a bank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
regardless of changes in prices  most assets and liabilities of the banking subsidiaries will be converted into a fixed number of dollars 
non earning assets  such as premises and equipment  do not comprise a major portion of premier s assets  therefore  most assets are subject to repricing on a more frequent basis than in other industries 
premier s ability to offset the effects of inflation and potential reductions in future purchasing power depends primarily on its ability to maintain capital levels by adjusting prices for its services and to improve net interest income by maintaining an effective asset liability mix 
management s efforts to meet these goals are described in other sections of this report

net interest income totaled  for the fourth quarter of  a decrease of  or from the net interest income earning in the same quarter of the decline is the result of a lower level of loans outstanding which generate higher yields and the high level of non accrual loans at farmers deposit bank 
the provision for loan losses was  in the fourth quarter of  a decrease of  or when compared to the fourth quarter of non interest income excluding securities transactions totaled  in the fourth quarter of  an increase of  or
