all share and per share amounts on this annual report and form k have been adjusted to reflect a three for two stock split  which was effective on february  critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies include those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when its products are shipped 
at this point  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  and provisions for estimates  including rebates  promotional adjustments  price adjustments  returns  chargebacks  and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable 
accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions to net sales and accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are presented net of allowances relating to these provisions  which were approximately  at june  and  at june  the change in the reserves for various sales adjustments was not proportionally equal to the change in sales because of changes in the product mix and the customer mix 
provisions for rebates  promotional and other credits are estimated based on historical payment experience  estimated customer inventory levels and contract terms 
provisions for other customer credits  such as price adjustments  returns and chargebacks require management to make subjective judgments 
unlike branded innovator companies  lannett does not use information about product levels in distribution channels from third party sources  such as ims health and ndc health in estimating future returns and other credits 
these provisions are discussed in more detail below and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
chargebacks the provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue 
the company sells its products directly to wholesale distributors  generic distributors  retail pharmacy chains and mail order pharmacies 
the company also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies  managed care organizations  hospitals  nursing homes and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
lannett enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products 
the indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these agreed upon prices 
lannett will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price 
this credit is called a chargeback 
the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell through levels by the company s wholesale customers to the indirect customers  and estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
as sales to the large wholesale customers  such as cardinal health  amerisourcebergen and mckesson corporation  increase  the reserve for chargebacks will also generally increase 
however  the size of the increase depends on the product mix 
the company continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it believes that actual chargebacks may differ from estimated reserves 
rebates rebates are offered to the company s key customers to promote customer loyalty and encourage greater product sales 
these rebate programs provide customers with rebate credits upon attainment of pre established volumes or attainment of net sales milestones for a specified period 
other promotional programs are incentive programs offered to the customers 
at the time of shipment  the company estimates reserves for rebates and other promotional credit programs based on the specific terms in each agreement 
the reserve for rebates increases as sales to certain wholesale and retail customers increase 
however  these rebate programs are tailored to the customers individual programs 
hence  the reserve will depend on the mix of customers that comprise such rebate programs 
returns consistent with industry practice  the company has a product returns policy that allows select customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product s lot expiration date  in exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases 
the company s policy requires that the customer obtain pre approval from the company for any qualifying return 
the company estimates its provision for returns based on historical experience  changes to business practices and credit terms 
while such experience has allowed for reasonable estimations in the past  history may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns 
the company continually monitors the provisions for returns  and makes adjustments when it believes that actual product returns may differ from established reserves 
generally  the reserve for returns increases as net sales increase 
price adjustments price adjustments  also known as shelf stock adjustments  are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of the company s products that customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction 
decreases in selling prices are discretionary decisions made by management to reflect competitive market conditions 
amounts recorded for estimated shelf stock adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers  estimated declines in market prices and estimates of inventory held by customers 
the company regularly monitors these and other factors and evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available 
the following table identifies the reserves for each major category of revenue allowance and a summary of the activity reserve category chargebacks rebates returns other total reserve balance as of june       actual credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal     actual credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal      additional reserves charged to net sales during fiscal      reserve balance as of june       the company ships its products to the warehouses of its wholesale and retail chain customers 
when the company and a customer come to an agreement for the supply of a product  the customer will generally continue to purchase the product  stock its warehouse s and resell the product to its own customers 
the company s customer will continually reorder the product as its warehouse is depleted 
lannett generally has no minimum size orders for its customers 
additionally  most warehousing customers prefer not to stock excess inventory levels due to the additional carrying costs and inefficiencies created by holding extra inventory 
as such  lannett s customers continually reorder the company s products 
it is common for lannett s customers to order the same products on a monthly basis 
for generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  it is critical to ensure that customers warehouses are adequately stocked with its products 
this is important due to the fact that several generic competitors compete for the consumer demand for a given product 
availability of inventory ensures that a manufacturer s product is considered 
otherwise  retail prescriptions would be filled with competitors products 
for this reason  the company periodically offers incentives to its customers to purchase its products 
these incentives are generally up front discounts off its standard prices at the beginning of a generic campaign launch for a newly approved or newly introduced product  or when a customer purchases a lannett product for the first time 
customers generally inform the company that such purchases represent an estimate of expected resales for a period of time 
this period of time is generally up to three months 
the company records this revenue  net of any discounts offered and accepted by its customers  and net of any estimated returns and other credits  at the time of shipment 
the company s products have either months or months shelf life at the time of manufacture 
the company monitors its customers purchasing trends to attempt to identify any significant lapses in purchasing activity 
if the company observes a lack of recent activity  inquiries will be made to such customer regarding the success of the customer s resale efforts 
the company will attempt to minimize any potential return or shelf life issues by maintaining an active dialogue with its customers 
the products that the company sells are generic versions of brand named drugs 
the consumer markets for such drugs are well established markets with many years of historically confirmed consumer demand 
such consumer demand may be affected by several factors  including alternative treatments  cost  etc 
however  the effects of changes in such consumer demand for lannett s products  like generic products manufactured by other generic companies  are gradual in nature 
any overall decrease in consumer demand for generic products generally occurs over an extended period of time 
this is because there are thousands of doctors  prescribers  third party payers  institutional formularies and other buyers of drugs that must change prescribing habits  and medicinal practices before such a decrease would affect a generic drug market 
if the historical data the company uses  and the assumptions management makes to calculate its estimates of future returns  chargebacks and other credits do not accurately approximate future activity  its net sales  gross profit  net income and earnings per share could change 
however  management believes that these estimates are reasonable based upon historical experience and current conditions 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
inventories the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements 
the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case it may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if the company s inventory is determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is determined to be undervalued  the company may have recognized excess cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal sales increased as a result of additions to the company s prescription line of products  including digoxin tablets  first marketed in september  levothyroxine sodium tablets  first marketed in april and unithroid tablets  first marketed in august these product additions had the effect of increasing the total net sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the fact the company sold the products for longer periods of time in the twelve months ended june  these product additions accounted for approximately million of the increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal additionally  sales of a portion of the company s previously marketed products  such as primidone tablets  butalbital with aspirin and caffeine with codeine capsules and dicyclomine tablets increased by approximately million from fiscal to fiscal as a result of new customer accounts  increased unit sales and increased unit sales prices 
the company from time to time will raise its sales prices if there is an increase in the price of the brand named drug 
generally  the company sells its products at the accepted market prices for such products 
if the competitive environment changes  the company monitors such changes to determine the effect on the market prices for its products 
such changes may include new competitors  fewer competitors  or an increase in the price of the innovator drug 
the increase in sales of a portion of the company s products was partially offset by a decrease in sales of certain other products  including butalbital with aspirin and caffeine capsules which decreased million due to increased competition and a discontinuation of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride tablets which resulted in a loss of sales of 
the company sells its products to customers in various categories 
the table below identifies the company s net sales to each category 
fiscal net fiscal net customer category fiscal net sales sales sales wholesaler distributor million million million retail chain million million million mail order pharmacy million million million private label million million million total million million million sales in every category  with the exception of private label  increased each of the past three years 
this is a result of the factors described in the previous paragraph 
sales to private label customers decreased in fiscal and as a result of the company s successful efforts in growing the lannett label accounts 
increasing sales to customers that purchased the lannett label products ie the wholesale  retail and mail order customer categories had the effect of reducing sales to private label customers 
cost of sales increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the cost of sales increase is due to an increase in direct variable costs and certain indirect costs as a result of the increase in sales volume  and related production activities 
these costs include raw materials cost of finished goods purchased and resold  which increased approximately  labor and benefits expenses  which increased by approximately  and other miscellaneous production related expenses which increased in total by approximately  gross margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross profit margins is a result of a decrease in net weighted average prices from some of the company s products due to increased market competition  increases in direct and indirect costs as well as a change in the product sales mix 
during fiscal  a larger percentage of the company s total net sales were from products supplied by jsp 
the company s average gross profit margin for products from jsp is less than the average gross profit margin for products internally manufactured 
depending on future market conditions for each of the company s products  changes in the future sales product mix may occur 
these changes may affect the gross profit percentage in future periods 
research and development r d expenses increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase is primarily due to an increase in the costs of generic bioequivalence tests which are commonly required for anda submissions 
the company incurred approximately million in fiscal for bioequivalence testing fees  compared to approximately  in fiscal the increase in r d is also a result of an increase in the number of chemists in the r d laboratory and the related payroll and benefits expenses  which increased by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and an increase of raw material consumption of approximately  used in the development and formulation of new products not yet approved by the fda 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase is a result of an increase in the following expenses payroll incentive compensation and benefits  which increased by approximately million  consulting services  which increased by approximately  including sarbanes oxley consulting  legal expenses  which increased by approximately  computer support costs  which increased by approximately  advertising expenses  which increased by approximately  travel and entertainment expenses  which increased by approximately  insurance expenses  which increased by approximately  investor relations marketing expenses  which increased by approximately  directors fees  which increased by approximately  and miscellaneous other expenses  including utilities  training  general and safety supplies  office supplies  accounting fees  telephone and rent expense 
such miscellaneous expenses comprised the remainder of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increases were due to the hiring of additional administrative employees and a general increase in administrative expenses due to the growth of the company in terms of employees  production volume and sales 
currently  the company s only finished product inventory supplier is jerome stevens pharmaceuticals  inc jsp  in bohemia  new york 
purchases of finished goods inventory from jsp accounted for approximately of the company s inventory purchases in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal on march   the company entered into an agreement with jsp for the exclusive distribution rights in the united states to the current line of jsp products  in exchange for four million  shares of the company s common stock 
the jsp products covered under the agreement included butalbital  aspirin  caffeine with codeine phosphate capsules  digoxin tablets and levothyroxine sodium tablets  sold generically and under the brand name unithroid r 
the term of the agreement is ten years  beginning on march  and continuing through march  both lannett and jsp have the right to terminate the contract if one of the parties does not cure a material breach of the contract within thirty days of notice from the non breaching party 
during the term of the agreement  the company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase minimum dollar quantities of jsp s products being distributed by the company 
the company projects that it will be able to meet the minimum purchase requirements  but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to do so 
if the company does not meet the minimum purchase requirements  jsp s sole remedy is to terminate the agreement 
under the agreement  jsp is entitled to nominate one person to serve on the company s board of directors the board  provided  however  that the board shall have the right to reasonably approve any such nominee in order to fulfill its fiduciary duty by ascertaining that such person is suitable for membership on the board of a publicly traded corporation including  but not limited to  complying with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission  the american stock exchange and applicable law including the sarbanes oxley act of the agreement was included as an exhibit in the form k filed by the company on may  the obligation of the company to issue the four million  shares was subject to the receipt of a fairness opinion issued by a recognized and reputable investment banking firm in opining that the issuance of the four million  shares and the resulting dilution of the ownership interest of the company s minority shareholders was fair to such shareholders in view of jsp s products contribution or potential contribution to the company s profitability 
on april   the investment banker  donnelly penman and partners  which was selected by the independent directors of the company s board  opined that the issuance of the four million  shares and the resulting dilution of the ownership interest of the company s minority shareholders was fair to such shareholders from a financial point of view 
as such  subsequent to april   the company issued four million  shares to jsp s designees 
as a result of the transaction  the company recorded an intangible asset related to the contract in the amount of  the intangible asset was recorded based upon the fair value of the  shares at the time of issuance to jsp

the company reported net income of  for fiscal  or basic and diluted income per share  compared to net income of  for fiscal  or basic and diluted income per share 
results of operations fiscal to fiscal net sales increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal sales increased as a result of additions to the company s prescription line of products  including prednisolone tablets  first marketed in october  butalbital with aspirin  caffeine and codeine phosphate capsules  first marketed in december  isoniazid tablets  first marketed in january  digoxin tablets  first marketed in september and levothyroxine sodium tablets  first marketed in april these product additions had the effect of increasing the total annual sales in fiscal  compared to fiscal  due to the fact that the company sold the products for longer periods of time in fiscal  compared to fiscal of these product additions  butalbital with aspirin  caffeine and codeine phosphate capsules  digoxin tablets and levothyroxine sodium tablets accounted for approximately million of the increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal additionally  sales of a portion of the company s previously marketed products  including primidone tablets and butalbital with aspirin and caffeine capsules  increased due to new customer accounts  increased unit sales  and higher unit sales prices 
the company raised its sales prices for primidone milligram tablets in fiscal subsequent to an increase in the price of the brand named drug 
generally  the company sells its products at the accepted market prices for such products 
if the competitive environment changes  the company monitors such changes to determine the effect on the market prices for its products 
such changes may include new competitors  fewer competitors  or an increase in the price of the innovator drug 
the increase in sales of a portion of the company s products was offset by a decrease of approximately million in net sales of certain other products  including pseudoephedrine hydrochloride tablets and guaifenesin ephedrine hydrochloride tablets 
due to increased competition for these two products  and the company s decision to allocate its production capacity to higher margin prescription products  the company discontinued its production  marketing and distribution of these two products in fiscal such higher margin products included primidone and milligram tablets and butalbital with aspirin and caffeine capsules 
cost of sales increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the cost of sales increase is due to an increase in direct variable costs and certain indirect overhead costs as a result of the increase in sales volume and related production activities 
these costs include raw materials cost of finished goods purchased and resold  which increased by approximately  labor and benefits expenses  which increased by approximately  depreciation expense  which increased by approximately  and other miscellaneous production related expenses  which increased in total by approximately  gross profit margins for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the decrease in the gross profit percentage is due to the product sales mix 
incremental sales in fiscal of some or all of the company s new products were at gross profit percentages less than the company s average gross profit percentage from fiscal this is a result of more competition for such drugs  and an erosion in generic market pricing for such drugs 
during fiscal  a larger percentage of the company s total net sales were of jsp manufactured products  as compared to the percentage of the company s total net sales during fiscal the company s average gross profit margin for the jsp products is less than the average gross profit margin for products internally manufactured 
as such  the change in product sales mix reduced the gross profit percentage in fiscal depending on future market conditions for each of the company s products  changes in the future sales product mix may occur 
these changes may affect the gross profit percentage in future periods 
research and development expenses increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase is a result of an increase in the cost of clinical bioequivalence testing fees  which increased by approximately  outsourced product development consulting services  which increased by approximately  payroll and benefits expenses  which increased by approximately  raw materials used in the development and formulation of new products not yet approved by the fda  which increased by approximately  and miscellaneous other r d expenses  which increased by a total of approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase is a result of an increase in the following expenses payroll and benefits  which increased by approximately  consulting services  which increased by approximately  travel and entertainment expenses  which increased by approximately  investor relations marketing expenses  which increased by approximately  advertising expenses  which increased by approximately  professional services fees  which increased by approximately  computer support expenses  which increased by approximately  and miscellaneous other administrative expenses  which increased by a total of approximately  these increases were due to the hiring of additional administrative employees and a general increase in administrative expenses due to the growth of the company in terms of employees  production volume and sales

at this time  the company s infrastructure includes employee resources for all of the major administrative functions  with the exception of a general counsel 
as the company continues to grow in the future  it may consider hiring an employee to fulfill this role  which is currently performed by outside professional services firms 
during fiscal  the company has surpassed its historical highs in terms of net sales  gross profit  operating income  net income and total market capitalization value 
this growth is a result of additions to the company s line of generic products  new customers  higher unit sales  increased product prices and a management focus on minimizing unnecessary overhead and administrative costs 
some of the new generic products sold by lannett during fiscal and fiscal were developed and manufactured by lannett while others are manufactured by jsp  one of lannett s primary suppliers

the anticipated capital expenditure requirements will support the company s growth related to new product introductions and increased production output due to expected higher sales levels 
in april  the company entered into a loan agreement the agreement with a governmental authority  the philadelphia authority for industrial development the authority to finance future construction and growth projects of the company

except as set forth in this report  the company is not aware of any trends  events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the company s short term or long term liquidity or financial condition 
prospects for the future the company has several generic products under development 
these products are all orally administered  solid dosage ie tablet capsule products designed to be generic equivalents to brand named innovator drugs 
the company s developmental drug products are intended to treat a diverse range of indications 
one of these developmental products  an orally administered obesity product  represents a generic anda currently owned by the company  but not currently manufactured and distributed for commercial consumption 
as one of the oldest generic drug manufacturers in the country  formed in  lannett currently owns several andas for products which it does not manufacture and market 
these andas are simply dormant on the company s records 
occasionally  the company reviews such andas to determine if the market potential for any of these older drugs has recently changed  so as to make it attractive for lannett to reconsider manufacturing and selling it 
if the company makes the determination to introduce one of these products into the consumer marketplace  it must review the anda and related documentation to ensure that the approved product specifications  formulation and other features are feasible in the company s current environment 
generally  in these situations  the company must file a supplement to the fda for the applicable anda  informing the fda of any significant changes in the manufacturing process  the formulation  the raw material supplier or another major feature of the previously approved anda 
the company would then redevelop the product and submit it to the fda for supplemental approval 
the fda s approval process for anda supplements is similar to that of a new anda 
another developmental product  also an orally administered obesity product  is a new anda submitted to the fda in july for approval 
the fda has recently disclosed that the average amount of time to review and approve a new anda is approximately seventeen months 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin commercially producing and shipping this product 
the remainder of the products in development represent either previously approved andas that the company is planning to reintroduce anda supplements  or new formulations new andas 
the products under development are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  scale up  and or clinical testing 
depending on the complexity of the active ingredient s chemical characteristics  the cost of the raw material  the fda mandated requirement of bioequivalence studies  the cost of such studies and other developmental factors  the cost to develop a new generic product varies 
it can range from  to million 
some of lannett s developmental products will require bioequivalence studies  while others will not depending on the fda s orange book classification 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping additional products 
in addition to the efforts of its internal product development group  lannett has contracted with an outside firm the pharmanetwork llc in new jersey for the formulation and development of several new generic drug products 
these outsourced r d products are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  analytical method development and testing and manufacturing scale up 
these products are orally administered solid dosage products intended to treat a diverse range of medical indications 
it is the company s intention to ultimately transfer the formulation technology and manufacturing process for all of these r d products to the company s own commercial manufacturing sites 
the company initiated these outsourced r d efforts to compliment the progress of its own internal r d efforts 
the company is also developing a drug product that does not require fda approval 
the fda allows generic manufacturers to manufacture and sell products which are equivalent to innovator drugs which are grand fathered  under fda rules  prior to the passage of the hatch waxman act of the fda allows generic manufacturers to produce and sell generic versions of such grand fathered products by simply performing and internally documenting the product s stability over a period of time 
under this scenario  a generic company can forego the time and costs related to a fda mandated anda approval process 
the company currently has one product under development in this category 
the developmental drug is an orally administered  prescription solid dosage product 
the company has also contracted with spectrum pharmaceuticals inc  based in california  to market generic products developed and manufactured by spectrum and or its partners 
the first applicable product under this agreement is ciprofloxacin tablets  the generic version of cipro r  an anti bacterial drug  marketed by bayer corporation  prescribed to treat infections 
the company has also initiated discussions with other firms for similar new product initiatives  in which lannett will market and distribute products manufactured by third parties 
lannett intends to use its strong customer relationships to build its market share for such products  and increase future revenues and income 
the majority of the company s r d projects are being developed in house under lannett s direct supervision and with company personnel 
hence  the company does not believe that its outside contracts for product development  including the pharmanetwork llc  or manufacturing supply  including spectrum pharmaceuticals inc  are material in nature  nor is the company substantially dependent on the services rendered by such outside firms 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping such additional products
