item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview financial federal corporation is an independent financial services company operating through three wholly owned subsidiaries 
we do not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries  partnerships or joint ventures 
we also do not have any off balance sheet assets or liabilities and we are not involved in any income tax shelters 
we have one fully consolidated special purpose entity that we established for our asset securitization facility 
we are engaged in one line of business  lending money in the form of secured loans and leases collectively referred to as finance receivables to small and medium sized businesses for their equipment financing needs 
our revenue is generated solely by interest and other fees charges earned on our finance receivables 
we need to borrow most of the money we lend  therefore liquidity is of paramount importance to us 
typically  we borrow from banks and insurance companies and issue commercial paper directly and indirectly to money market funds and other investors 
at july   approximately of our finance receivables are funded with debt and with equity 
we earn interest income on our finance receivables and incur interest expense on our debt 
we focus on maximizing the spread between the rates we earn on our receivables and the rates we incur on our debt while maintaining the credit quality of our receivables and managing our interest rate risk 
interest rates earned on our finance receivables are currently fixed and floating and interest rates incurred on our debt are currently fixed and floating 
therefore  our profitability can be affected significantly by changes in market interest rates 
our profitability can also be affected significantly by the credit quality of our finance receivables 
credit quality can affect revenue  provisions for credit losses and operating expenses through reclassifying receivables to from non accrual status  incurring charge offs and incurring costs associated with handling non performing assets 
we employ various strategies to manage our interest rate risk and credit risk 
our main areas of focus are asset quality  liquidity and interest rate risk 
each is discussed in detail in separate sections of this discussion 
these areas are integral to our long term profitability 
our key performance measures are net charge offs  non performing assets  delinquencies  receivables growth  leverage  available liquidity  net interest margin and net interest spread 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables  impaired finance receivables  assets received to satisfy receivables and residual values on direct financing leases 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables is an estimate of losses inherent in our finance receivables at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is difficult to determine and requires a significant degree of judgment 
the allowance is based on total finance receivables  charge off experience  non accrual delinquent finance receivables and our current assessment of the risks inherent in our finance receivables from national and regional economic conditions  industry conditions  concentrations  the financial condition of counterparties includes the obligor lessee and other parties we may have recourse to such as equipment vendors manufacturers and owners affiliates of the obligor lessee  equipment collateral values and other factors 
the allowance level may have to be changed significantly due to unexpected changes in these factors 
increases in the allowance would reduce net earnings through higher provisions for credit losses 
the allowance was million of finance receivables at july  which included million specifically allocated to impaired receivables 
the allowance includes amounts specifically allocated to impaired receivables and an unallocated general amount to provide for losses inherent in the remainder of the receivables portfolio 
upon evaluating the net realizable value of impaired receivables  we may record a write down or establish a specific allowance based on the probability of loss 
write downs are recorded based on the fair value of the underlying collateral 
specific allowances are established when the collection of all amounts due is not fully supported solely by the value of the underlying primary equipment collateral depending on the level and type of other items supporting collectibility 
the general allowance is supported by an analysis of historical losses charge offs covering a two year period in line with the average maturity of our receivables from which percentage loss ranges are developed and applied to receivables based on their assigned risk profile 
risk profiles are assigned to receivables based on industry and past due status 
the computed range of losses is adjusted for expected recoveries and differences between current and historical loss trends and other factors 
the analysis is performed quarterly and is reviewed by senior management 
at july   the computed range of losses was adjusted upward to account for the potential effects that the significant rise in oil prices could have on our customers cash flows and ability to remit payments to us 
although our methodology is designed to compute probable losses  due to the significance of the estimates used the computed range of losses  as adjusted  may differ significantly from actual losses 
impaired finance receivables are recorded at their current estimated net realizable value if less than their carrying amount 
assets received to satisfy receivables are recorded at their current estimated fair value less selling costs if less than their carrying amount 
these estimated values are based on our evaluation of the expected cash flows and market value condition of the collateral assets 
values are estimated by analyzing recent sales of similar equipment  used equipment publications  market knowledge and equipment vendor inquiries 
unexpected adverse changes in or incorrect conclusions regarding expected cash flows  market value condition of collateral assets or length of time needed to sell the equipment would require a write down to be recorded 
this would reduce net earnings 
impaired finance receivables and assets received to satisfy receivables totaled million of finance receivables at july  residual values are recorded on direct financing leases at the lowest of i any stated purchase option  ii the present value at the end of the initial lease term of rentals due under any renewal options or iii our projection of the equipment s fair value at the end of the lease 
residual values may not be fully realized due to subsequent unexpected adverse changes in equipment values 
this would result in a write down and reduce net earnings 
residual values were million of finance receivables at july  historically  we have realized the recorded residual value upon disposition 
significant events credit ratings in july  fitch ratings  inc fitch  a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization raised its rating on our senior term debt to bbb from bbb and revised its rating outlook to stable from positive 
fitch also affirmed its f rating on the commercial paper issued by our major operating subsidiary 
the higher rating should broaden our ability to obtain term financing and may lower the cost of such financing 
asset quality  liquidity  funding source diversification  leverage  size  business model  growth prospects  conservatism and experience are among the factors considered in determining credit ratings 
issuance of senior convertible debentures in april  we issued million of senior convertible debentures and used the proceeds net of million of issuance costs to repay a million term note that matured  to repurchase million of common stock and to increase liquidity by repaying million of securitization and bank borrowings 
the debentures also further diversified our funding sources and lengthened debt maturities 
the debentures are currently rated bbb by fitch with a stable outlook and do not contain any financial or other restrictive covenants 
the senior debt of our subsidiaries is effectively senior to the debentures 
the debentures have a fixed annual interest rate and interest is payable semi annually 
commencing in april  we may incur additional interest for a semi annual interest period if the average market value of the debentures on the last five days of the prior interest period was at least higher than their principal amount 
additional interest would be computed at the annual rate of of the average market value of the debentures during the aforementioned five days 
the debentures are convertible into million shares of our common stock at the conversion price of per share resulting in an initial conversion rate of shares per  of principal 
the conversion price was set at over the april  closing price of 
the conversion rate would be adjusted if a specified corporate transaction occurs including dividend payments or stock splits 
the debentures can be converted into common stock only under the following circumstances  i in any fiscal quarter if the closing price of our common stock was at least higher than the conversion price for at least of the last trading days of the prior fiscal quarter the market price condition  ii the debentures are rated bb or lower by fitch three ratings levels lower than the initial rating  iii we call the debentures for redemption or iv a specified corporate transaction occurs 
currently  the market price condition would be met if the price of our common stock closed above for the required period 
our common stock closed at on july  we can redeem the debentures for their principal amount anytime starting in april and debenture holders can require us to repurchase debentures at their principal amount on each five year anniversary of issuance or when a specified corporate transaction occurs 
the debentures have a year term 
upon conversion  we can deliver the value of convertible shares in any combination of cash and or common stock 
we may elect to irrevocably fix the payment of the principal amount of converted debentures in cash and any additional value in stock 
repurchase of common stock in april  we repurchased million shares of our common stock with million of the convertible debentures proceeds 
we paid the april  closing price per share 
the shares repurchased represented of shares outstanding 
we repurchased the shares to offset the potential dilution of the million shares issuable from the convertible debentures 
leverage increased to from on the date of the repurchase 
the repurchase is accretive to basic and diluted earnings per share 
at july   the million shares were held in treasury

the amounts of net earnings and diluted and basic earnings per share excluding the fiscal million after tax convertible debt redemption loss are non gaap financial measures 
we believe these amounts are useful to investors in comparing our fiscal and fiscal operating results

receivable portfolio and asset quality this section discusses trends and characteristics of our finance receivables and our approach to managing credit risk 
a key part of this section is asset quality 
asset quality statistics measure our underwriting standards  skills and policies procedures and can indicate the direction and levels of future charge offs 
in millions fiscal fiscal change change finance receivables   allowance for credit losses net charge offs non performing assets delinquent finance receivables as a percentage of receivables allowance for credit losses net charge offs non performing assets delinquent finance receivables finance receivables outstanding increased by million to billion at july  from billion at july  finance receivables comprise installment sale agreements and secured loans collectively referred to as loans and direct financing leases 
at july    billion of finance receivables were loans and million were leases 
finance receivables originated in fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
finance receivables collected in fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
originations increased due to greater demand for domestic equipment financing 
maintaining the credit quality of our portfolio is our primary focus 
we manage our credit risk by using disciplined and established underwriting policies and procedures  by closely monitoring our portfolio and by skillfully handling non performing accounts 
our underwriting policies and procedures require obtaining a first lien on equipment financed or leased 
we focus on financing equipment that has an economic life exceeding the term of the transaction  historically low levels of technological obsolescence  use in multiple industries  ease of access and transporting  and a broad  established resale market 
securing our receivables with such equipment can mitigate potential charge offs 
we may also obtain additional equipment or other collateral  third party guarantees  advanced payments and or hold back a portion of the amount financed 
we do not finance lease aircraft and railcars  computer related equipment  telecommunications equipment or equipment located outside the united states  and we do not lend to consumers 
the allowance for credit losses was million at july  and million at july  the allowance level was and of finance receivables at july  and at july   respectively 
we periodically review the allowance to determine that its level is appropriate 
the allowance level may decline further if our asset quality statistics continue to improve and remain at favorable levels 
net charge offs of finance receivables write downs less recoveries decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and the loss ratio decreased to from 
net charge offs have been decreasing due to fewer non performing assets and improved economic conditions and equipment resale values 
non performing assets comprise non accrual finance receivables and repossessed equipment assets received to satisfy receivables as follows in millions july  non accrual finance receivables repossessed equipment total non performing assets delinquent finance receivables transactions with a contractual payment or more days past due were million of total finance receivables at july  compared to million of total finance receivables at july  our asset quality statistics improved markedly during fiscal due to improved conditions in the economy and the industries we finance 
repossessed equipment and delinquencies have fallen below expected levels 
therefore  further improvement in these measures is not expected 
non accrual finance receivables may decline further due to better payment performance decreases in non accrual receivables typically trail decreases in delinquencies since several months of payment performance is required to reclassify a receivable to accrual status and fewer bankruptcies 
at july   approximately of non accrual finance receivables were not delinquent 
the level of net charge offs may also continue to improve because of fewer non performing assets  improved equipment values and higher rates of recoveries 
reductions in net charge offs and non accrual receivables would have a positive effect on earnings through decreases in the provision for credit losses and by increasing finance income 
although our asset quality statistics continue to improve  we are concerned about how the significant increases in oil prices and increases in interest rates will affect our portfolio 
gasoline and interest are significant expenses for a majority of our customers and the increases in these costs could significantly impact their operating cash flows and their ability to remit payments to us 
in addition  we have several customers that owe us over million 
if one or more of these customers accounts become delinquent  impaired or repossessed  our asset quality statistics could worsen even though the overall trend for the portfolio may remain positive 
these factors could reverse the current direction of our asset quality statistics 
finance receivables reflect certain industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk 
these concentrations arise from counterparties having similar economic characteristics that could cause their ability to meet their contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
at july   the major industry concentrations were construction related  road transportation  waste services and manufacturing 
manufacturing accounted for of our finance receivables at july  in fiscal  we significantly reduced our originations of manufacturing receivables based on their past performance 
at july   the us regional geographic concentrations were southeast  southwest  northeast  west and central 
our underwriting policies limit our credit exposure with any single customer 
at july   this limit was million 
our largest and ten largest customer s accounted for million and million  respectively  of total finance receivables at july  liquidity and capital resources this section describes our needs for substantial amounts of capital debt and equity  our approach to managing liquidity and our current funding sources 
key indicators are leverage  available ongoing liquidity and credit ratings 
at july   our credit rating was raised and our leverage was low by finance company standards 
we also had ample liquidity available and the maturities of our term debt were staggered and exceed the maturities of our finance receivables 
liquidity and access to capital are vital to our operations and growth 
we need continued availability of funds to originate or acquire finance receivables  to purchase portfolios of finance receivables and to repay maturing debt 
to ensure that we have adequate liquidity  we periodically project our financing needs based on estimated receivables growth and maturing debt  we closely monitor capital markets and we diversify our funding sources 
we may obtain funds from many sources  including operating cash flow  private and public issuances of term debt  conduit and term securitizations of finance receivables  committed unsecured revolving credit facilities  dealer placed and directly issued commercial paper and sales of common and preferred equity 
we believe that our sources of liquidity are well diversified 
we are not dependent on any funding source or on any credit provider 
at july   we had million of available funding sources  million of unused bank credit facilities after taking commercial paper outstanding into account and million of an unused securitization facility 
we can also obtain an additional million of asset securitization financings 
we believe  but cannot assure  that sufficient liquidity is available to us to support our future operations and growth 
our term debt is rated bbb by fitch and commercial paper issued by our major operating subsidiary million at july  is rated f by fitch 
our access to capital markets at competitive rates is partly dependent on these investment grade credit ratings 
the subsidiary s debt agreements contain restrictive covenants including limitations on indebtedness  encumbrances  investments  dividends and other distributions to us  sales of assets  mergers and other business combinations  capital expenditures  interest coverage and net worth 
none of the agreements contain a material adverse change clause 
total debt increased by million to billion at july  from billion at july  and stockholders equity decreased by million to million at july  from million at july  due to the repurchase of million of common stock in april as a result  leverage debt to equity ratio increased to at july  from at july   but remains relatively low for a finance company 
this allows for substantial asset growth because credit providers typically are more willing to lend to companies with low leverage 
historically  our leverage has not exceeded debt comprised the following in millions july  july  amount percent amount percent term notes asset securitization financings convertible debentures commercial paper borrowings under bank credit facilities total principal   fair value adjustment of hedged debt total debt   term notes in august and april  we repaid the following fixed rate term notes at maturity million with an rate and million with a rate  respectively 
in september  we issued a million floating rate term note to a bank maturing in december in april  we canceled our million medium term note program established in fiscal after the last outstanding note issued under the program was repaid 
million of the program was left unused 
at july   the million of term notes comprised million of private placements and medium term notes issued to insurance companies and million of bank term loans 
asset securitization financings we have a million asset securitization facility 
the facility has a one year term and expires in april subject to renewal 
the facility has been renewed three times since it was established in july borrowings under the facility are limited to a minimum level of securitized receivables 
if borrowings exceed the minimum level  we must repay the excess or securitize more receivables 
we can securitize more receivables during the term of the facility 
upon expiration and non renewal of the facility  we must repay borrowings outstanding or convert them into term debt 
the term debt would be repaid monthly in amounts equal to collections of securitized receivables less interest incurred 
currently  we would exercise the conversion option upon non renewal 
based on the contractual payments of the million of securitized receivables at july   the term debt would be fully repaid by september the unsecured debt agreements of our major operating subsidiary allow of its finance receivables outstanding to be securitized  approximately million at july  therefore  we could securitize an additional million of finance receivables at july  borrowings are limited to of securitized receivables 
in april  we repaid million of securitization borrowings with proceeds from the convertible debentures 
commercial paper we issue commercial paper directly and through a million program 
commercial paper is unsecured and matures between and days 
we have not obtained commitments from any purchaser of our commercial paper for additional or future purchases 
increases in commercial paper are generally offset by decreases in bank and other borrowings  and vice versa 
we are required as a condition of our credit rating to maintain committed revolving credit facilities from banks so that the aggregate amount available thereunder exceeds commercial paper outstanding 
therefore  at july   the combined amount of commercial paper and bank borrowings outstanding was limited to million was outstanding at july  
bank credit facilities at july   we had million of committed unsecured revolving credit facilities from eight banks a million decrease from july  
this includes million of facilities with original terms ranging from two to five years and million of facilities with an original term of one year 
at july   million was outstanding  with a maturity of three days  under a multi year facility 
these facilities range from million to million 
the multi year facilities expire as follows in millions fiscal these facilities provide us with a dependable  low cost source of funds and support for our commercial paper program 
we can borrow the full amount under each facility 
none of the facilities are for commercial paper back up only 
these facilities may or may not be renewed upon expiration 
bank credit facility activity follows in millions year ended july  year ended july  amount of banks amount of banks total at beginning of year new expired not renewed increases total at end of year renewed at expiration information on the combined amounts of commercial paper and bank borrowings follows in millions fiscal maximum outstanding during the year average outstanding during the year outstanding at year end contractual obligations our long term contractual obligations and other pertinent information at july  are summarized as follows in millions payments due by period less than more than total year years years years term notes convertible debentures operating leases other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total payments percentage other debt cumulative payments   cumulative scheduled collections of finance receivables    the weighted average maturity of our term debt term notes and convertible debentures was years at july  and term notes and convertible debentures are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and operating leases in note other long term liabilities represent deferred compensation 
other debt includes asset securitization financings  commercial paper and bank borrowings that are due within one year 
as shown above  on a cumulative basis for each period  scheduled collections of finance receivables exceed cumulative payments under contractual obligations 
stockholders equity in fiscal  we acquired million shares of our common stock for million 
we increased the amount available under our stock repurchase program by million in fiscal and amended the program to include repurchases of convertible debentures 
at july   million was available under the program 
market interest rate risk and sensitivity this section discusses how changes in market interest rates can affect our profitability and discusses our approach to managing interest rate risk 
our earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in market interest rates includes libor  rates on us treasury securities  money market rates and the prime rate 
changes in these rates affect our finance income and interest expense 
rate increases would reduce earnings and rate decreases would increase earnings because floating rate debt includes short term debt significantly exceeds floating rate finance receivables 
when market interest rates rise  the resulting increase in interest expense would significantly exceed the resulting increase in finance income 
conversely  when market interest rates decline  the resulting decrease in interest expense would significantly exceed the resulting decrease in finance income 
these effects would diminish over time 
in addition  since our interest earning assets exceed our interest bearing liabilities  eventually  lower market interest rates would reduce earnings this is occurring currently and higher rates would increase earnings 
these broad statements do not take into account the effects of economic and other conditions that could accompany interest rate fluctuations 
our earnings are subject to the risk of rising interest rates at july  because of our high ratios of fixed rate receivables and floating rate debt floating rate debt exceeded floating rate receivables by million as shown in the table below 
this risk is mitigated by the terms and prepayment experience of our receivables 
finance receivables provide for monthly payments over relatively short periods of two to five years and are accelerated by prepayments 
at july   million of fixed rate finance receivables are scheduled to be collected within one year and the weighted average remaining maturity of fixed rate finance receivables is under two years 
we do not match the maturities of our debt to our finance receivables 
fixed rate floating rate in millions amount percent amount percent total finance receivables   debt  stockholders equity total debt and equity  at july   floating rate debt asset securitization financings  floating rate term notes  fixed rate term notes swapped to floating rates  commercial paper and bank borrowings reprices interest rate changes as follows million within one month  million  within the following two months and the remainder  million  within the following six months 
the repricing periods of floating rate debt follow in millions balance at july  repricing frequency asset securitization financings monthly floating rate notes quarterly floating rate swaps of fixed rate notes semi annually commercial paper to days day average bank borrowings generally daily we quantify interest rate risk by calculating the effect on net earnings of a hypothetical  immediate basis point rise in market interest rates 
at july   such a hypothetical adverse change in rates would reduce annual net earnings by approximately million 
we believe this is an acceptable level of risk when compared to the lower interest costs of floating rate debt as opposed to fixed rate debt 
in fiscal  the weighted average rate of floating rate debt was basis points lower than the weighted average rate of fixed rate debt 
actual future changes in market interest rates and the effect on net earnings may differ materially due to changes in finance receivable and debt repricing structures 
in addition  other factors that may accompany an actual immediate basis point increase in market interest rates were not considered in the calculation 
we monitor and manage our exposure to market interest rate fluctuations through risk management procedures that include using certain derivative financial instruments and changing the proportion of our fixed rate term debt versus our floating rate debt 
we may use derivatives to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on certain debt obligations 
we do not speculate with nor trade derivatives 
in fiscal  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million 
we designated them as fair value hedges of million of fixed rate notes due in april and million of fixed rate notes due in august the swaps expire on the notes maturity dates 
the swaps effectively converted the fixed rate notes to floating rates 
at july   fixed rate notes swapped to floating rates totaled million 
under the terms of the swaps  we receive fixed rates equal to the rates on the respective hedged notes and pay floating rates indexed to six month libor at july  
the swaps reduced interest expense by million in fiscal this amount is expected to be lower in fiscal due to increases in market interest rates 
the weighted average receive rate exceeded the current weighted average pay rate by basis points at july  terms of the swaps follow in millions expiration notional receive july  issue date date amount rate pay rate reprice date april april october july april october july june october july june october july june october august april october april august january the net yield of finance receivables less the weighted average cost of borrowed funds represents the net interest spread  an important measure of a finance company s profitability 
years ended july  net yield of finance receivables weighted average cost of borrowed funds net interest spread the net yield of finance receivables continued to decline during fiscal since yields obtained on new receivables were lower than yields on receivables collected 
this was caused by the extended period of low interest rates 
the net yield is expected to decline further in fiscal but to a lesser extent although yields obtained on new receivables improved for the first time in over three years at the end of fiscal the decline in yield was offset by the decline in the average cost of funds in fiscal the average cost of funds declined due to i the effects of million of fixed rate notes swapped to significantly lower floating rates  ii million of term notes bearing high fixed interest rates repaid at maturity during the last two years and iii the reduction of short term borrowing costs resulting from lower average market interest rates 
short term market interest rates started to increase during the fourth quarter of fiscal these and any future increases in short term rates will increase our average cost of funds as our floating rate debt reprices 
the full impact of recent rate increases will occur in the second quarter of fiscal after all of our floating rate debt and swaps have repriced
