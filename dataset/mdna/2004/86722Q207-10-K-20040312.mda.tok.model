item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements as of the dates and for the periods presented in this section 
you should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
we are a leading provider of wireless communications services in the southeastern united states 
as of december   our wireless communications licenses covered approximately million potential customers in a contiguous geographic area encompassing portions of virginia  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  georgia and kentucky 
in february  we entered into a joint venture with at t wireless 
as part of this agreement  at t wireless contributed personal communications services licenses for mhz of authorized frequencies covering million potential customers within defined areas of our region in exchange for an equity position in triton 
since that time  we have expanded our coverage area to include an additional million potential customers through acquisitions and license exchanges with at t wireless 
as part of these transactions with at t wireless  we were granted the right to be the exclusive provider of wireless mobility services using co branding with at t within our region 
we believe our markets are strategically attractive because of their proximity to at t wireless systems in the washington  dc  charlotte  north carolina and atlanta  georgia markets  which collectively cover a population of more than million individuals 
in addition  we are the preferred provider of wireless mobility services to at t wireless digital wireless customers who roam into our markets 
our strategy is to provide extensive coverage to customers within our region  to offer our customers high quality  innovative voice and data services with coast to coast coverage and to benefit from roaming revenues generated by at t wireless and other carriers wireless customers who roam into our covered area 
our markets have attractive demographic characteristics for wireless communications services and  according to the us census bureau  include of the top markets in the country with population densities that are greater than the national average 
we currently provide wireless voice and data services over two overlapping networks 
one network uses tdma technology  which we have successfully launched in all of our markets 
the second network utilizes gsm gprs technology  which is capable of providing enhanced voice and data services 
we have overlaid  of our cell sites with gsm gprs technology and have deployed two gsm gprs switches 
since we began offering service in our markets  our subscriber base and total revenues have grown dramatically 
from our initial launch of personal communications services in january to december   our subscriber base has sustained continued growth year over year  with an additional  net subscribers added during the twelve months ended december  as the result of our growing subscriber base  total revenues have increased from million for the year ending december  to million for the year ending december  revenues consist primarily of monthly access  airtime  long distance and roaming charges billed to our subscribers  equipment revenues generated by the sale of wireless handsets and accessories to our subscribers and roaming revenues generated by charges to other wireless carriers for their subscribers use of our network 
roaming minutes generated by non triton subscribers increased from a monthly high of million minutes in to a monthly high of million minutes in  with total roaming minutes rising to billion minutes in  which represents a increase over our net loss has increased from a loss of million for the year ended december  to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the net loss increase is primarily due to debt extinguishment costs incurred during the year ended december  related to the retirement of our old credit facility and our senior subordinated notes due  offset primarily by increased leverage on fixed costs 
our accumulated deficit increased to million as of december  as a result of our net loss for the current year 
since the inception of our personal communications services in january  our long term debt has increased from million to billion as of december  this increase is due primarily to the 
table of contents increased funding required to build out our network  which includes  tdma cell sites and seven tdma switches and the continued overlay of this network with gsm gprs technology 
critical accounting polices and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenues as services are rendered 
unbilled revenues result from service provided from the billing cycle date to the end of the month and from other carrier s customers using our network 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  in a subscriber activation  the total proceeds are allocated to the associated deliverables 
when equipment cost exceeds equipment revenue  referred to as equipment margin  the activation fee collected  up to the amount of the equipment margin  is recognized immediately as equipment revenue 
any subscriber activation fee collected in excess of the equipment margin is deferred and recognized over the estimated subscriber s life 
equipment sales are a separate earnings process from other services we offer and are recognized upon delivery to the customer and reflect charges to customers for wireless handset equipment purchases 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our subscribers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of a material portion of our subscribers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period we made that determination 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period we made that determination 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  other than indefinite lived intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or in the strategy for our overall business 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to 
table of contents result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset is not recoverable  we measure any impairment based upon a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate we determine to be commensurate with the risk involved 
our primary indefinite lived intangible assets are fcc licenses 
we test investments in fcc licenses for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fcc licenses may be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value with the carrying value 
we aggregate all of our fcc licenses for the purpose of performing the impairment test as the licenses are operated as a single asset and  as such  are essentially inseparable from one another 
we estimate the useful lives of our property  plant and equipment and our finite lived intangible assets in order to calculate depreciation and amortization expense on these assets 
we periodically evaluate our useful lives  considering such factors as industry trends  new technologies and significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or in the strategy for our overall business 
the actual useful lives may be different then our estimated useful lives  which would thereby result in different carrying values of our property  plant  equipment and intangible assets 
these evaluations could result in a change in our depreciable lives and  therefore  our depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
revenue we derive our revenue from the following sources service 
we sell wireless personal communications services 
the various types of service revenue associated with wireless communications services for our subscribers include monthly recurring charges and monthly non recurring airtime charges for local  long distance and roaming airtime used in excess of pre subscribed usage 
our customers roaming charges are rate plan dependent and are based on the number of pooled minutes included in their plans 
service revenue also includes non recurring activation service charges 
equipment 
we sell wireless personal communications handsets  data devices and accessories that are used by our customers in connection with our wireless services 
equipment sales are a separate earnings process from other services offered by triton  and we recognize equipment sales upon delivery to the customer and reflect charges to customers for wireless handset equipment purchases 
in addition  the fair value of a handset received from a customer in a handset upgrade transaction is recorded as equipment revenue 
roaming 
we charge per minute fees and per kilobyte fees to other wireless telecommunications companies for their customers use of our network facilities to place and receive wireless services 
in addition  our roaming revenue is contingent upon our roaming partners subscriber growth and their use of our network 
we believe our roaming revenues will be subject to seasonality 
we expect to derive increased revenues from roaming during vacation periods  reflecting the large number of tourists visiting resorts in our coverage area 
in addition  we expect the growth of the wireless industry to continue  and as a result  we expect roaming minutes to continue to increase  which will be offset by contractual rate decreases that occurred during as a result  we expect roaming revenue to remain relatively flat through costs and expenses our costs of services and equipment include equipment 
we purchase personal communications services handsets and accessories from third party vendors to resell to our customers for use in connection with our services 
because we subsidize the sale of handsets to encourage the use of our services  the cost of handsets is higher than the resale price to the customer 
we do not manufacture any of this equipment 

table of contents roaming fees 
we incur fees to other wireless communications companies based on airtime usage by our customers on other wireless communications networks 
transport and variable interconnect 
we incur charges associated with interconnection with other wireline and wireless carriers networks 
these fees include monthly connection costs and other fees based on minutes of use by our customers 
variable long distance 
we pay usage charges to other communications companies for long distance service provided to our customers 
these variable charges are based on our subscribers usage  applied at pre negotiated rates with the other carriers 
cell site costs 
we incur expenses for the rent of towers  network facilities  engineering operations  field technicians and related utility and maintenance charges 
other expenses include selling  general and administrative 
our selling expense includes advertising and promotional costs  commission expense for our sales associates and agents and fixed charges such as store rent and retail associates salaries 
general and administrative expense includes customer care  billing  financial services and bad debt  information technology  finance  accounting and legal services 
functions such as customer care  billing  finance  accounting and legal services are centralized in order to achieve economies of scale 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight line method  generally over three to twelve years  based upon estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease 
network development costs incurred to ready our network for use are capitalized 
depreciation of network development costs begins when the network equipment is ready for its intended use and is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset 
prior to january   our personal communications services licenses and our cellular licenses were being amortized over a period of years 
in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  and as a result  we ceased to amortize our fcc licenses  which we believe qualify as having an indefinite life 
termination benefits and other related charges 
for the year ended december   we recorded expenses related to a workforce reduction that occurred in january the expenses consisted primarily of one time termination benefits and relocation expenses 
non cash compensation 
as of december   we recorded million of deferred compensation associated with the issuances of our common and preferred stock to employees 
we will recognize this compensation over four to five years as the stock vests 
interest expense income 
interest expense through december  consists of interest on our old credit facility  which was retired in june  our senior subordinated discount notes that were retired in july  our senior subordinated notes due  our senior subordinated notes due  and our senior notes due  net of capitalized interest 
interest expense is also recorded for commitment fees paid on the undrawn portion of our credit facility and the amortization of deferred costs incurred in the connection with our issuance of debt instruments 
interest income is earned primarily on our cash and cash equivalents 
other expense 
other expense primarily includes the mark to market of our interest rate swaps that did not qualify as hedges  which were retired in june debt extinguishment costs 
for the year ended december   we recorded expenses related to the retirement of our old credit facility and our subordinated notes 
these expenses consisted primarily of a premium paid to holders of the subordinated notes who tendered their notes  tender offer fees and the write off of deferred financing costs 

table of contents income tax expense 
income tax expense primarily includes non cash tax adjustments resulting from triton having to establish a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  as triton is no longer able to reasonably estimate the period of reversal for deferred tax liabilities related to licensing costs as the result of the adoption of sfas no 
as a result  we may not rely on the reversal  if any  of deferred tax liabilities associated with licensing costs as a means to realize our deferred tax assets  which primarily represent net operating loss carryforwards 
additionally  due to a lack of earnings history  we cannot rely  for accounting purposes  on forecasts of future earnings as a means to realize our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have determined that  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 deferred tax valuation allowances are required on those deferred tax assets 
our ability to improve our margins will depend on our ability to manage our variable costs  including selling  general and administrative expense  costs per gross added subscriber and costs of maintaining and upgrading our network 
we expect our operating costs to grow as our operations expand and our customer base and call volumes increase 
over time  these expenses should represent a reduced percentage of revenues as our customer base grows 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net subscriber additions were  for the year ended december   bringing our total subscribers to  as of december   an increase of over our subscriber total as of december  our strategy of shifting our channel mix to more cost effective  company owned retail locations and strategically aligned agents adversely impacted new subscriber additions  as several inefficient agent relationships were terminated 
new subscriber additions were also impacted by the bankruptcy of our largest independent agent during the third quarter of this independent agent historically had contributed approximately to of our monthly gross subscriber additions 
collectively  the loss of these agents resulted in the gross subscriber additions shortfall as compared to the prior year 
during the year ended december   of our gross subscriber additions were on a one or two year service contract 
subscriber churn was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
subscriber churn is calculated by dividing subscriber deactivations by our average subscriber base for the respective period 
we believe that our churn rate remains consistently low compared to industry average due to our high quality system performance  our commitment to quality customer service and our focused retention efforts 
the fcc mandated that wireless carriers provide for local number portability lnp in certain markets by november  and by may  in all remaining markets 
six of our thirty seven markets were included in the november  deadline 
lnp allows subscribers to keep their wireless phone number when switching to a different service provider 
lnp did not have a material impact on subscriber churn in  but we anticipate that number portability could increase churn in the future 
average revenue per user  or arpu  was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
arpu reflects the average amount billed to subscribers based on rate plan offerings 
arpu is exclusive of service revenue credits made to retain existing subscribers of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
arpu is calculated by dividing service revenue  excluding service revenue credits made to existing subscribers  by our average subscriber base for the respective period 
for more details regarding our calculation of arpu  refer to reconciliation of non gaap financial measures below 
we continue to focus on attracting new customers with rate plans that provide more value to the customer at a higher average customer bill 
the arpu decrease of  or  was primarily the result of a change in our rate plan mix  as many existing high arpu subscribers migrated to the unplan to take advantage of that plan s unlimited minutes for calls from the subscriber s local calling area at a lower monthly cost 
we believe that most high arpu subscribers who will migrate to the unplan have 
table of contents done so 
the shift in rate plan mix was largely offset by price increases 
anticipated new product offerings in the pay in advance and prepaid markets  which may be at lower price points  could cause arpu to decline over time 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  service revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in service revenue was due primarily to growth of subscribers  partially offset by a slight decrease in arpu 
we expect subscriber growth to continue  and hence  we expect service revenue to continue to increase 
roaming revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the net increase in roaming revenue was the result of increased roaming minutes of use resulting from the expansion of our network  the implementation of roaming agreements with such carriers as cingular wireless and the overall growth in the wireless industry  partially offset by any reductions in roaming rates contractually agreed to with other carriers 
roaming minutes for the year ended december  were billion  which represents a increase over the year ended december  we expect the growth of the wireless industry to continue  and as a result  we expect roaming minutes to continue to increase  which will be offset by contractual rate decreases that occurred during as a result  we expect roaming revenue to remain relatively flat in the foreseeable future 
equipment revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  equipment revenue includes the revenue earned in the sale of a handset or handset accessories to new and existing subscribers 
in addition  equipment revenue includes the fair value of handsets received from a subscriber in a handset upgrade transaction 
the equipment revenue increase was due primarily to an increase in handset sales to existing subscribers and an increase in the sale of excess subscriber returned handsets to third party wholesalers and resellers 
in addition  on july   we adopted eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which requires that the total revenue proceeds of a transaction be allocated to the associated deliverables 
when equipment cost exceeds equipment revenue  referred to as equipment margin  in a subscriber activation transaction  the activation fee collected up to the amount of the equipment margin  is recognized immediately as equipment revenue 
previously  this activation revenue was deferred and recognized over the average life of a subscriber 
cost of service excluding amortization  depreciation and non cash compensation was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was related to a higher volume of traffic on our network driven by rate plan offerings and subscriber growth as well as higher roaming minutes of use 
as a result of the variable components of cost of service  such as interconnect and toll  our cost of service may increase in conjunction with anticipated subscriber growth 
cost of service as a percentage of revenue  excluding equipment revenue  was and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of was primarily attributable to increased costs to operate our gsm gprs network and to expand and maintain our wireless network to support an increased number of minutes of use on our tdma network 
cost of service as a percentage of revenue  excluding equipment revenue  may decline in the future as we continue to leverage our fixed cost of service against increased revenue 
cost of equipment was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of equipment includes the cost associated with the sale of a handset or handset accessories to new and existing subscribers 
the cost of equipment increase was due primarily to an increase in handset sales to existing subscribers  as well as increased sales of excess subscriber returned handsets to third party wholesaler and resellers 
selling  general and administrative expenses excluding amortization  depreciation and non cash compensation were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  selling expenses decreased by million or  primarily due to lower fixed costs resulting from the streamlining of our operations 
table of contents during the first quarter of as well as decreased spending on advertising and promotions in general and administrative expenses decreased by million or  primarily due to decreased bad debt expense  which was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
as a result of the variable components of selling  general and administrative expense  such as customer care personnel and billing costs  our selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in conjunction with anticipated subscriber growth 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  excluding equipment revenue  was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of is primarily attributable to increased customer care efficiency and focused collection efforts  which controlled bad debt expense  and increased leverage of other fixed costs 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue  excluding equipment revenue  may decline in the future as we continue to further leverage our fixed general and administrative costs  such as headcount and rent expense  against increased revenue 
cost per gross addition  or cpga  was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the cpga increase of  or  was primarily the result of increased equipment margin due to equipment promotions we offered and decreased leverage on fixed acquisition costs such as store rent expense and sales and marketing overhead costs  as the result of lower gross subscriber additions  partially offset by the streamlining of our operations in the first quarter of cpga is calculated by dividing the sum of equipment margin for handsets sold to new subscribers equipment revenue less cost of equipment  which costs have historically exceeded the related revenue and selling expenses related to adding new subscribers by total gross subscriber additions during the relevant period 
retail customer service expenses and the equipment margin on handsets sold to existing subscribers  including handset upgrade transactions  are excluded  as these costs are incurred specifically for existing subscribers 
for more details regarding our calculation of cpga  refer to reconciliation of non gaap financial measures below 
termination benefits and other related costs were million for the year ended december  theses expenses  which consisted primarily of severance and relocation costs  resulted from the streamlining of our operations during january there were no termination benefits and other related costs for the year ended december  we expect that the termination benefits will result in approximately million of savings in each subsequent fiscal year 
non cash compensation expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  non cash compensation represents the amortization of restricted stock  valued at the date of grant  over the applicable vesting period 
the increase is attributable to the vesting of an increased number of restricted shares of our class a common stock awarded to management in prior years 
the increase in the number of vested restricted shares was primarily the result of the acceleration of a portion of our retired chief operating officer s restricted shares in accordance with his retirement agreement 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase relates primarily to increased depreciation expense due to the growth in our depreciable asset base resulting from capital expenditures 
in addition  we recognized a million loss in connection with the disposal of certain cell site equipment deemed to be obsolete during the year ended december  for the year ended december   there was a million loss recognized in connection with management s decision not to complete the construction of certain cell sites 
depreciation will continue to increase as additional portions of our network are placed into service and the gprs gsm overlay is completed 
interest expense was million  net of capitalized interest of million  for the year ended december  interest expense was million  net of capitalized interest of million  for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  relates primarily to a decrease of million of interest expense on our subordinated notes  which were repurchased in july  and a decrease of million of interest expense on our former bank credit facility  which was retired in 
table of contents june of  partially offset by an increase of million of interest expense related to our june private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  a decrease of million in capitalized interest for the year ended december  and million of accreted interest expense related to an asset retirement obligation for our leased facilities recorded in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
we had a weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december   on our average borrowings under our former and current bank credit facility and our average obligation for our senior and subordinated debt  as compared with the weighted average interest rate for the year ended december  other expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of million  or  relates primarily to a decrease in the loss on our former interest rate swap derivative instruments  which were extinguished in june of loss on derivative instruments was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
debt extinguishment costs were million for the year ended december  these expenses  which consisted primarily of tender offer premium  tender offer fees and the write off of deferred financing costs  resulted from the repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of our subordinated notes and repayment of all outstanding borrowings under our former bank credit facility 
there were no debt extinguishment costs for the year ended december  interest and other income was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to lower average interest rates on lower average cash balances 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to a non cash tax adjustment in the first quarter of to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  as we are no longer able to reasonably estimate the period of reversal  if any  for deferred tax liabilities related to licensing costs as the result of the adoption of sfas no 
we will continue to incur deferred tax expense as additional deferred tax liabilities associated with the amortization of the tax basis of our fcc licenses are incurred 
net loss was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net loss decrease of million  or resulted primarily from the items discussed above 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net subscriber additions were  for the year ended december   bringing our total subscribers to  as of december   an increase of over our subscriber total as of december  the increase in subscribers was primarily due to continued demand for our digital service offerings and pricing plans 
during the year ended december   of our gross subscriber additions were post pay on a one or two year service contract 
subscriber churn was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
subscriber churn is calculated by dividing subscriber deactivations by our average subscriber base for the respective period 
arpu was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
subscriber arpu reflects the average amount billed to subscribers based on rate plan offerings 
subscriber arpu excludes service revenue credits made to retain existing subscribers of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease  or  was primarily the result of a change in our rate plan mix  as many existing high arpu subscribers migrated to the unplan to take 
table of contents advantage of the plan s unlimited minutes for calls from the subscriber s local calling area at a lower monthly cost 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  service revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in service revenue was due primarily to growth of subscribers 
roaming revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in roaming revenue was the result of increased roaming minutes of use resulting from the expansion of our network  the implementation of new roaming agreements with such carriers as cingular wireless and the overall growth in the wireless industry 
equipment revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the equipment revenues increase was due primarily to an increase in the sale of phone upgrades to existing subscribers 
cost of service excluding amortization  depreciation and non cash compensation was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was related to the higher volume of traffic on our network driven by subscriber growth and higher roaming minutes of use 
cost of service as a percentage of revenue  excluding equipment revenue  was and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease of was primarily attributable to increased leverage on fixed interconnect and cell site costs 
cost of equipment was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of equipment includes the cost associated with the sale of a handset or handset accessories to new and existing subscribers 
the increase in cost of equipment was driven primarily by an increase in the sale of phone upgrades to existing customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses excluding amortization  depreciation and non cash compensation were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  selling expenses increased by million or  primarily due to increased commissions offered to sales associates and agent distributors to promote the unplan 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or  primarily due to expansion of the number of customer care representatives to support our customer growth 
although our collection effort remained focused  bad debt expense increased from million in to million in the increase of million was the result of the growth of our subscriber base and higher involuntary churn 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  excluding equipment revenue  was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of is primarily attributable to increased customer care efficiency and increased leverage on other fixed costs 
non cash compensation expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to the vesting of an increased number of restricted shares of our class a common stock awarded to management in prior years 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase relates primarily to increased depreciation expense due to the growth in our depreciable asset base resulting from capital expenditures  partially offset by the effect of ceasing amortization on our fcc licenses in accordance with sfas in addition  we incurred million of charges during as the result of losses on the sale of fixed assets as well as charges to accelerate depreciation on certain assets as a result of management s decision not to complete the construction of certain network infrastructure 

table of contents interest expense was million  net of capitalized interest of million  for the year ended december  interest expense was million  net of capitalized interest of million  for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  relates primarily to increases of interest expense on our january private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes and our november private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes  offset partially by a decrease of interest expense on our bank credit facility 
the aggregate interest expense of these debt instruments increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest expense also increased million due to the accretion of interest on our may private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated discount notes and a decrease in capitalized interest of million for the year ended december  we had a weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december   on our average borrowings under our bank credit facility and our average obligation for the senior subordinated debt  as compared with the weighted average interest rate for the year ended december  other expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of million  or  relates primarily to a decrease in the loss on the mark to market of our interest rate swaps  which was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the losses were recognized as the result of the change in fair value of our interest rate swap derivative instruments  which did not qualify as hedges 
these interest rate swaps do not qualify as hedges as the result of the repayment  in november of  of previously matched variable rate debt under our bank facility with proceeds from our note offering 
in addition  write offs of deferred financing costs decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  these write offs were a result of the early repayment of a portion of our credit facility 
interest and other income was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was due primarily to lower average interest rates on lower average cash balances 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to non cash tax adjustments to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as we are no longer able to reasonably estimate the period of reversal  if any  for deferred tax liabilities related to licensing costs as the result of the adoption of sfas no 
on january  as a result  we may not rely on the reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with licensing costs as a means to realize our deferred tax assets  which primarily represent net operating loss carryforwards 
additionally  due to a lack of earnings history  we cannot rely  for accounting purposes  on forecasts of future earnings as a means to realize our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have determined that  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 deferred tax valuation allowances are required on those deferred tax assets 
net loss was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net loss decrease of million resulted primarily from the items discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources the construction of our network and the marketing and distribution of wireless communications products and services have required  and will continue to require  substantial capital 
capital outlays have included license acquisition costs  capital expenditures for network construction  funding of operating cash flow losses and other working capital costs  debt service and financing fees and expenses 
we believe that cash on hand and available credit facility borrowings will be sufficient to meet our projected capital requirements through although we estimate that these funds will be sufficient to finance our continued growth  we may have additional capital requirements  which could be substantial  for future upgrades and advances in new technology 
if necessary  we may need to access external sources of capital including the issuance of public equity or debt securities 
our need to obtain additional cash from external 
table of contents sources will be impacted by our ability to reduce costs and to continue to achieve subscriber and revenue growth 
in january  we completed a reduction in our workforce  eliminating positions  which we expect to result in approximately million of operating cost reductions during capital needs we currently anticipate that our future capital needs will principally consist of funds required for capital expenditures to expand and enhance our network  operating expenses related to our network  operating expenses related to the acquisition and retention of subscribers  debt service requirements related to our long term debt and capital lease obligations  preferred stock dividends  potential material increases in the cost of compliance with regulatory mandates  and other general corporate expenditures 
we expect capital expenditures and the acquisition of fcc licenses  which were made historically to enhance and expand our wireless network in order to increase capacity and to satisfy subscriber needs and competitive requirements  to continue to decrease as we complete the overlay of our gsm gprs network by the middle of although we anticipate an overall decrease in capital expenditures as the result of the completion of our gsm gprs overlay  we will continue to upgrade our network capacity and service quality to support our anticipated subscriber needs and growth 
we estimate that capital expenditures will be approximately million to million for capital resources as of december   our capital resources included million of cash and million of available credit facility borrowings  resulting in total liquidity of million to fund our operations 
historically  we have been unable to fund our capital expenditures and license acquisition costs with the cash generated by our operating activities 
therefore  we have met the cash needs of our business principally by raising capital from issuances of debt and equity securities 
to the extent we can generate sufficient cash flow from our operating activities  we will be able to use less of our available liquidity and will have less  if any  need to raise capital from the capital markets 
to the extent we generate lower cash flow from our operating activities  we will be required to use more of our available liquidity to fund operations or raise additional capital from the capital markets 
we may be unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  if at all 
our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon  among other things the amount of revenue we are able to generate from our customers  the amount of operating expenses required to provide our services  the cost of acquiring and retaining customers  including the subsidies we incur to provide handsets to both our new and existing customers  and our ability to continue to grow our customer base

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments the table below sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of future contractual payments for our contractual obligations as of december  these disclosures are also included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  and the relevant footnotes are cross referenced in the table below 
the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon  among other things  the terms of the relevant agreements and appropriate classification of items under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  currently in effect 
future events  including additional issuances of our securities and refinancing of those securities  could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
payments due by period dollars in thousands less than after footnote contractual obligation total year years years years reference long term debt capital lease obligations interest obligations preferred stock dividends operating leases purchase obligations total cash contractual obligations payments are included in the period by which they are contractually required to be made

we are a party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and obligate us to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as the delivery of functioning software or products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no amounts have been included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures we utilize certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with gaap  to assess our financial performance 
a non gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that i excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of 
table of contents excluding amounts  that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows  or ii includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented 
the discussion of each non gaap financial measure we use in this report  other than cash cost per user  appear above under results of operations 
a brief description of the calculation of each measure is included where the particular measure is first discussed 
our method of computation may or may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
the following tables reconcile our non gaap financial measures with our financial statements presented in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  average revenue per user arpu dollars in thousands  except arpu service revenue subscriber retention credits adjusted service revenue average subscribers arpu we believe arpu  which calculates the average service revenue billed to an individual subscriber  is a useful measure to evaluate our past billable service revenue and to assist in forecasting our future billable service revenue 
arpu is exclusive of service revenue credits made to retain existing subscribers  as these are discretionary reductions of the amount billed to a subscriber 
we have no contractual obligation to issue these credits  therefore  arpu reflects the amount subscribers have contractually agreed to pay us based on their specific usage pattern 
arpu is calculated by dividing service revenue  exclusive of service revenue credits made to existing subscribers  by our average subscriber base for the respective period 
for quarterly periods  average subscribers is calculated by adding subscribers at the beginning of the quarter to subscribers at the end of the quarter and dividing by two  for year to date periods  average subscribers is calculated by adding the average subscriber amount calculated for the quarterly periods during the period and dividing by the number of quarters in the period 
year ended december  arpu  plus roaming revenue less subscriber retention costs dollars in thousands  except arpu service revenue roaming revenue service and roaming revenue average subscribers arpu we believe arpu  plus roaming revenue less subscriber retention credits  which calculates the average service and roaming revenue per subscriber  provides a gauge to compare our service and roaming revenue to that of other wireless communications providers that may have significantly more or less subscribers and  therefore  more or less revenue on an aggregate basis 
in addition  this metric minus cash costs per user  or ccpu  is an indicator of net cash flow generated on a per subscriber basis 

table of contents year ended december  ccpu and cpga dollars in thousands  except ccpu and cpga cost of service general and administrative expense total cost of equipment transactions with existing subscribers ccpu operating expenses selling expense total cost of equipment transactions with new subscribers cpga operating expenses termination benefits and other related charges non cash compensation depreciation and asset disposal amortization total operating expenses ccpu operating expenses from above equipment revenue transactions with existing subscribers ccpu costs  net average subscribers ccpu cpga operating expenses from above equipment revenue transactions with new subscribers cpga costs  net gross subscriber additions cpga we believe that ccpu  which calculates the cash cost to operate our business on a per subscriber basis  is a useful measure to compare our subscriber costs to that of other wireless communications providers 
in addition to our subscriber costs  ccpu includes the costs of other carriers subscribers roaming on our network 
ccpu is calculated as the total of gaap operating expenses reported on our consolidated statements of operations  less equipment revenue related to transactions with existing subscribers  depreciation and asset disposal  amortization  non cash compensation  termination benefits and related charges and operating costs incurred to acquire new subscribers as described below and denoted by in the above table  divided by our average subscribers for the period 
we believe cpga is a useful measure that quantifies the incremental costs to acquire a new subscriber 
this measure also provides a gauge to compare our average acquisition costs per new subscriber to that of other wireless communication providers 
cpga is calculated by dividing the sum of equipment margin for handsets sold to new subscribers equipment revenue less cost of equipment  which costs have historically exceeded the related revenue and selling expenses related to adding new subscribers by total gross subscriber additions during the relevant period 
retail customer service expenses are excluded from cpga  as these costs are incurred specifically for existing subscribers

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are highly leveraged and  as a result  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
our debt obligations are us dollar denominated 
our market risk  therefore  is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
as of december   our debt can be categorized as follows fixed interest rates senior notes senior subordinated notes subject to interest rate fluctuations bank credit facility our interest rate risk management program focuses on minimizing exposure to interest rate movements  setting an optimal mixture of floating and fixed rate debt and minimizing liquidity risk 
historically  we have selectively entered into interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate exposure 
due to the repayment of our former credit facility on june   we terminated all of our previously existing interest rate swaps for aggregate cash consideration of million  which included accrued and unpaid interest though the date of termination 
during fourth quarter of  we entered into three new interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount of million 
in addition  triton pcs entered into another interest swap in march  which has a notional amount of million 
swap counter parties are major commercial banks 
under these interest rate swap contracts  we agree to pay an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times a notional principal amount and receive in turn an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the notional amounts of the contracts are not exchanged 
net interest positions are settled semi annually 
information  as of december   for the interest rate swaps is as follows terms notional amount fair value swaps acting as hedges our cash and cash equivalents consist of short term assets having initial maturities of three months or less 
while these investments are subject to a degree of interest rate risk  this risk is not considered to be material relative to our overall investment income position
