overview shoe pavilion is an independent off price footwear retailer on the west coast that offers a broad selection of women s  men s and children s designer label and name brand merchandise 
the company operated retail stores in california  washington and oregon under the trade name shoe pavilion as of january  and retail stores as of december  the company operated an internet store as of january  and december in july  the company entered into a licensing agreement to operate the shoe departments of gordmans  inc formerly richman gordman price stores  inc department stores located in the midwest 
pursuant to notification from gordmans on december  the license agreement expired in june at which time the company discontinued operating all of the licensed shoe departments in gordmans department stores 
at december   the company operated shoe departments at gordmans  inc stores 
the company opened four retail stores and closed seven in in the company opened stores and closed five and in the company opened six retail stores and closed three 
the company closed licensed shoe departments in  including two it had opened in the company opened two licensed shoe departments in and three in during  the company intends to open two to four new stores  primarily in california 
the company s growth in net sales historically has resulted primarily from the opening of new stores 
the company expects that the primary source of future sales growth will continue to be new store openings and to a lesser extent from an improvement in comparable store sales 
although the company s comparable store sales have decreased during the past three years  the company believes that it can achieve an improvement in comparable store sales by focusing on refining its sales efforts  including merchandise selection  advertising and promotions 
in addition in late the company expanded its product line to include children s shoes and handbags 
in the company plans to expand its product line to include athletic accessories 
the company defines comparable stores as those stores that have been open for at least consecutive months 
stores open less than consecutive months are treated as new stores  and stores closed during the period are excluded from comparable store sales 
the company s comparable store net sales decreased  in  in and in net sales in and were negatively impacted because as of june the company no longer operated the licensed shoe departments 
net sales generated from the licensed shoe departments were million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
in addition  these stores generated a store operating contribution before overhead  distribution costs  interest and taxes of approximately 
million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the company does not allocate overhead  distribution costs  interest or taxes to stores 
the majority of the overhead costs  which consist of costs such as merchandising  accounting  information systems  rent and insurance  are shared expenses of the shoe pavilion stores and previously the licensed shoe departments 
the company seeks to acquire footwear merchandise on favorable financing terms and in quantities large enough to support future growth 
this strategy causes an increase in inventory levels at various times throughout the year 
as a result  similar to other off price retailers  the company s inventory turnover rates are typically less than full price retailers 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the company s financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from the company s estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
management believes that the company s application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  management has found the company s application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this form k 
the company has identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of average cost or market 
the company makes certain assumptions to adjust inventory based on historical experience and current information in order to assess that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
these assumptions can have a significant impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
fixed assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of fixed assets  the company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related fixed assets and reduces their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
the company believes at this time that the fixed assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
accrued workers compensation 
in december  the company modified its workers compensation insurance policy to a high deductible insurance program with an overall program ceiling to minimize exposure 
the company began recording an estimated liability for the self insured portion of the workers compensation claims 
the liability as of january  was  and is determined based on information received from our insurance carrier including claims paid  filed and reserved for  as well as using historical experience 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the settlement costs increase beyond what was anticipated  the recorded liability may not be sufficient 
accrued litigation 
in  the company was sued in los angeles county superior court by one of its store managers who asserted that he and all other store managers were improperly classified as exempt employees under california s wage and hour laws and therefore are entitled to overtime wages 
an amended complaint seeking class action status on behalf of all store managers in california was subsequently filed with the court 
in december the company entered into a settlement agreement of the lawsuit 
under the terms of the agreement  which must be approved by the court  the company would pay store managers a stipulated cash settlement based upon the number of weeks worked for the period from april  through december  during the fourth quarter ended january  the company recorded a reserve of approximately million for the estimated costs associated with the lawsuit settlement 
the liability recorded is an estimate and should a greater amount of claims occur or if the court does not certify the settlement  the recorded liability may not be sufficient 
income taxes 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some or a portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based upon its history of earnings the company believes that the realization of its deferred tax asset is more likely than not and therefore has not provided a valuation allowance for its deferred tax asset

risks associated with expansion the company s continued growth will depend to a significant degree on its ability to expand its operations through the opening of new stores and to operate these stores on a profitable basis 
the success of the company s planned expansion will be significantly dependent upon the company s ability to locate suitable store sites and negotiate acceptable lease terms 
in addition  several other factors could affect the company s ability to expand  including the adequacy of the company s capital resources  the ability to hire  train and integrate employees and the ability to adapt the company s operational systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its planned expansion or that any such expansion will be profitable 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s expansion within its existing markets will not adversely affect the individual financial performance of the company s existing stores or its overall operating results  or that new stores will achieve net sales and profitability levels consistent with existing stores 
to manage its planned expansion  the company regularly evaluates the adequacy of its existing systems and procedures  including product distribution facilities  store management  financial controls and management information systems 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will anticipate all of the changing demands that expanded operations may impose on such systems 
failure to adapt its internal systems or procedures as required could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company actively monitors individual store performance and has closed underperforming stores in the past 
the company intends to continue to close underperforming stores in the future  and if it were to close a number of stores  it could incur significant closure costs and reductions in net sales 
in certain instances  the company may be unable to close an underperforming store on a timely basis because of lease terms 
a significant increase in closure costs or the inability to close one or more underperforming stores on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase comparable store sales or open new stores to an extent sufficient to offset the loss of net sales and operating contribution received under the gordmans license agreement 
failure to successfully implement these plans could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
uncertainty of future operating results  fluctuations in comparable store sales until  the company had been profitable 
there can be no assurance that the company will return to profitability 
future operating results will depend upon many factors  including general economic conditions  the level of competition and the ability of the company to acquire sufficient inventory  achieve its expansion plans and effectively monitor and control costs 
there can be no assurance that the company s recent gross margin levels will be sustainable in the future 
historically  the company s comparable store sales have fluctuated widely

as the company s operations expand  its demand for off price inventory will continue to increase 
the company s footwear purchases typically involve manufacturing over runs  over orders  mid or late season deliveries or last season s stock 
the inability of the company to obtain a sufficient supply of readily salable  high margin inventory  to negotiate favorable discount and payment agreements with its suppliers or to sell large inventory purchases without markdowns could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in its net sales and net income

dependence on consumer spending and preferences the success of the company s operations depends upon a number of general economic factors relating to consumer spending  including employment levels  business conditions  interest rates  inflation and taxation 
there can be no assurance that consumer spending will not decline in response to economic conditions  thereby adversely affecting the company s operating results 
during the past three years the economies of the three states in which the company has stores have been subjected to a significant economic downturn that has only recently begun to end 
although  shoe pavilion s footwear prices are very reasonable  customers have been more cautious in spending for discretionary retail items 
all of the company s products are subject to changing consumer preferences 
consumer preferences could shift to types of footwear other than those that the company currently offers 
any such shift could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s future success will depend  in part  on its ability to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively anticipate or respond to such changes on a timely basis or at all

many of these competitors have stores in the markets in which the company now operates and in which it plans to expand 
many of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that in the future new participants will not enter the off price segment of the footwear market 
competitive pressures resulting from competitors pricing policies could materially adversely affect the company s gross margins 
there can be no assurance that the company will not face greater competition from other national  regional or local retailers or that the company will be able to compete successfully with existing and new competitors 
the inability of the company to respond to such competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
future capital needs the company expects that anticipated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under its credit facility will satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next months 
to the extent that the foregoing cash resources are insufficient to fund the company s activities  including new store openings planned for  additional funds will be required 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms or at all
