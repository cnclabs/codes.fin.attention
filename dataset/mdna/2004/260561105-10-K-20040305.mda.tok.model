item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview dow jones company is a global provider of business and financial news and information through newspapers  newswires  magazines  the internet  television and radio stations 
in addition  the company owns certain general interest community newspapers throughout the us approximately of the company s revenues are contributed from the print publishing segment  which is largely comprised of the global operations of the wall street journal 
the remaining of revenues are split almost equally between our general interest community newspapers segment and our electronic publishing segment  which includes newswires  wsj online and other electronic operations 
the company s overall financial results are largely dependent on the operating performance of the global wall street journal  which  to a significant extent  is dependent upon business to business bb advertising placed in its publications 
advertising volume fell sharply from its peak in driven by overall weakness in the global advertising environment  and particularly in the company s core financial and technology segments 
during this period  the company responded to this difficult business climate by reducing and controlling expenses  executing its business now long range plan initiatives and carefully managing working capital and other cash flow items 
since march  the company has aggressively trimmed its cost base through workforce and other expense reductions that reduced annual costs by approximately million and headcount by 
operating results in improved from after two years of successive declines 
the increase in was broad based with gains across all business segments as cost control efforts more than offset a less than decline in total revenues 
advertising linage at the us wall street journal began to strengthen in the second half of from cyclically depressed levels 
for the year  journal advertising linage was down  as an increase of in the second half of partially offset a decline in the first half of while the bb advertising environment showed improvement in the latter half of  advertising buying decisions from customers continue to be made on very short cycles 
as a result  monthly linage comparisons remain somewhat volatile and overall results remain well below normal levels 
in  the company began execution of its business now plan  aimed at accelerating growth and modestly reducing cyclicality by enhancing existing products and creating new ones to reach new customers  markets and channels 
the cornerstone of the business now plan is today s journal  a package of content  organization and design changes to the paper that also included a new personal journal section 
launched in april  today s journal also included increasing page capacity by and tripling color page capacity to pages a day 
today s journal has been met by terrific reader response and strong advertiser response as evidenced by a increase in color advertising in since its launch in  color pages are up approximately and consumer advertising is up 
the company has also globally integrated news gathering across dow jones  including better collaboration between the journal and dow jones newswires staffs to capitalize on its over  news employees 
the company is also using the success of today s journal to pursue another business now initiative  an aggressive strategy to improve circulation efficiency 
the journal s circulation is already vibrant dow jones has higher individually paid circulation than any other newspaper 
as such  its strategy is not aimed at growing circulation  but rather at maintaining it at the highest level of revenue and lowest productive level of spending 
so far  this strategy is working reasonably well the company has managed to maintain flat circulation levels while increasing its circulation profitability 
nonetheless  management is disappointed at the fact that print journal circulation revenue is down about this year  reflecting increased use of discount offers required in this difficult economic climate and deflationary print subscription price environment 
the company s electronic publishing segment continued to implement business now initiatives to improve its products  profits and margins 
dow jones newswires successfully launched newswire of the future  a web style product which enables users to gain easier and more useful access to breaking news items and features available every day 
in the fourth quarter of  the number of terminals carrying dow jones newswires increased from the third quarter  which was the first sequential increase in nearly two years  as retrenchments in the securities industry seem to have stabilized 
in the second year after the launch of the redesigned wall street journal online at wsj 
com  revenues are up  reflecting rate increases and modest growth in subscribers and advertisers 
this redesign included improvements in system infrastructure and a simpler  more modern architecture to accommodate long term growth in scale and new product initiatives 
another part of the company s business now plan was to enhance our ottaway community newspaper property portfolio 
phase one of that strategy was completed in the first half of by divesting five low growth community newspaper properties  which generated after tax cash proceeds of approximately million and utilized million of capital loss carryforwards 
the second phase of the plan was to acquire more strategic and financially attractive properties 
in may  the company acquired the record of stockton  california the stockton  record  a daily newspaper with paid circulation of  and sunday circulation of  and in october  the company purchased two smaller papers in southern oregon  the ashland tidings and the medford nickel

e contract guarantee  net in  the company completed the sale of its former subsidiary  telerate  to bridge information systems  inc bridge 
the purchase price consisted of million aggregate par value of year  redeemable  convertible  preferred stock of bridge  which was included in other investments  and cash of million 
under the terms of the sale  dow jones retained its 
table of contents guarantee of payments under certain circumstances of certain annual minimum payments for data acquired by telerate from cantor fitzgerald securities and market data corporation mdc under contracts entered into during the period when telerate was a subsidiary of dow jones contract guarantee 
the annual minimum payments average approximately million per year through october under certain conditions 
bridge agreed to indemnify dow jones for any liability dow jones incurred under the contract guarantee with respect to periods subsequent to bridge s purchase of telerate 
however  bridge filed for bankruptcy protection on february   after unsuccessful attempts to reorganize its operations and arrange for additional financing 
dow jones believes that cantor fitzgerald and mdc have the obligation to cover  mitigate or otherwise reduce and or avoid any losses or damages under these circumstances  including by securing the best possible commercial terms for the supply of the subject data to a third party or parties 
cantor and mdc deny that they have this obligation 
dow jones believes that any and all amounts which are received by cantor fitzgerald and or mdc in respect of such data would reduce any liability that dow jones might have under the contract guarantee 
as of december   there was a high degree of uncertainty  however  as to what value the data might have in the marketplace  whether an agreement would be reached by cantor fitzgerald and or mdc to supply the data to a third party or parties  the financial position of such party or parties  the timing of any such agreement and various related factors 
therefore  it was not possible for dow jones to determine with any certainty that any such offsets would in fact be realized  or at what time or in what amounts 
consequently  in december  the company established a reserve in the amount of million representing the present value of the total estimated annual minimum payments of about million over the remainder of the contract through october and using a discount rate of approximately 
earnings in included income of million resulting from bridge fulfilling its payment obligation to cantor during its post petition bankruptcy phase  which was partially offset by the accretion of discount on the reserve balance of million 
in  dow jones made one payment of million for amounts not paid by bridge prior to its bankruptcy 
earnings in and included accretion charges of million and million  respectively  which increased the reserve balance as of december  to million 
the company has classified million of this reserve as current based on the original due dates of the contract 
on november   the company instituted a lawsuit in the supreme court of the state of new york against mdc and cantor seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to the company s obligations  if any  under the guarantee 
in this lawsuit the company has asked the court to find that the company does not and will not owe any payment under the contract guarantee through october in the alternative  the company has asked the court to find that if any amount is owed  it must be reduced by amounts that cantor and mdc receive or should have received from other distribution of the data 
mdc has asserted counterclaims demanding payment of  allegedly the balance owed by telerate on november   interest  attorneys fees  specific performance of the guarantee  and a declaratory judgment as to the validity and interpretation of the guarantee through october cantor also commenced a separate lawsuit in the supreme court of the state of new york since consolidated with the company s case seeking payment of million allegedly the balance of the november minimum payment  payment of million in breach of contract damages  specific performance of the guarantee  a declaration that the guarantee remains in full force and effect  payment of approximately million allegedly owed by telerate and guaranteed by the company in the guarantee for the distribution of certain other data  attorneys fees  interest  and other relief 
the trial court in january denied motions by each of the parties that their own claims for relief be granted and the competing claims be dismissed 
appeals from those decisions are not being pursued  and discovery is proceeding 
due to the stage of the lawsuit at december   it is not possible to determine whether the court will find that any obligation the company had under the guarantee may be dismissed or reduced 
accordingly  the company believes the balance of the reserve continues to be appropriate 
while it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of this litigation  the company believes the likelihood of a loss exceeding the amount reserved is remote  however  it is possible that such loss could be less than the amount reserved 
f gain on non monetary exchange of interests in wsj europe and handelsblatt in december  the company and the von holtzbrinck group exchanged equity shareholdings so as to increase the company s ownership of the wall street journal europe to from and reduce the company s ownership of the von holtzbrinck group s business daily  handelsblatt  to from  with news and advertising relationships continuing 
the transaction was accounted for at fair value in accordance with eitf  interpretations of apb  as a disposition of of handelsblatt in exchange for the acquisition of an additional interest in the wall street journal europe

the company is now in litigation with cantor and mdc with respect to their claims for amounts allegedly due under the contract guarantee 
the company has various substantial defenses to these claims and the litigation is proceeding 
as of december   the balance of the reserve for the contract guarantee was million 
the company has classified million of this reserve as current based on the original due dates of the contract 
due to the stage of the lawsuit at december   it is not possible to determine whether the court will find that any obligation under the guarantee may be dismissed or reduced

these contracts  which expire ratably over  are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated operating expenses that are denominated in these foreign currencies 
revenues of the company are largely collected in us dollars 
the company has not entered into any new forward foreign exchange contracts since december these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that such expenses will be adversely affected by devaluation in the us dollar relative to these currencies

outlook in  we expect an improving advertising climate and modest revenue growth at each of our operating segments 
as we discussed earlier  advertising buying decisions from our customers continue to be made on very short cycles and revenue recovery at the global wall street journal is largely dependent on a sustained recovery in bb advertising 
expenses in are expected to be up around  with roughly two thirds of this increase due to an expected increase in newsprint prices  higher costs as a result of the acquisitions and higher costs as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange 
all other costs will be up roughly over last year as we use cost reductions to help mitigate higher medical  post retirement and insurance costs as well as employee salary increases 
pending transaction on february   the company announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire alternative investor  from wicks business information for million  plus net working capital  as defined 
the million purchase price could be increased by million  payable in  based on the performance of the acquired business

table of contents alternative investor is a provider of newsletters  databases and industry conferences for the venture capital and private equity markets  and upon the closing of the acquisition it will be combined into the company s dow jones newswires business 
this transaction is expected to be modestly accretive to dow jones earnings per share in pending accounting pronouncement in december  new medicare prescription drug legislation was enacted into law 
beginning in  this law adds a new prescription drug benefit under medicare and also provides a federal subsidy to companies that sponsor retiree health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare plan 
the subsidy amount  which is tax free  is of each medicare eligible retiree s drug costs between and  in january  the financial accounting standards boards fasb issued staff position fas  which gave companies the option of estimating the effect of the subsidy on their postretirement obligation in their financial statements or deferring the recognition of the subsidy until definitive guidance has been issued from the fasb 
the company has elected to defer the accounting for the effects of this new law 
therefore  any measures of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the net periodic benefit costs in the company s financial statements or accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the act 
at this time  specific guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy is pending  but when it is final could require the company to change previously reported information 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following are significant accounting policies of the company advertising revenue  net of commissions  is recognized in the period in which the advertisement is displayed 
the company s advertising rate card reflects certain volume based discounts  which require management to make certain estimates regarding future advertising volume 
these estimated rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the advertisement is displayed and are revised as necessary based on actual volume realized 
online related advertising revenue based on a minimum number of impressions is recognized as impressions occur 
revenue recognition from subscriptions to the company s print publications and information services is recognized in income as earned  pro rata on a per issue basis  over the subscription period 
circulation revenue includes sales to retail outlets newsstands  which are subject to returns 
the company records these retail sales upon delivery  net of estimated returns 
these estimated returns are based on historical return rates and are revised as necessary based on actual returns realized 
costs in connection with the procurement of subscriptions are charged to expense as incurred 
revenue from licensing the dow jones averages includes both upfront one time fees and ongoing revenue 
both upfront fees and ongoing licensing revenue are recognized in income as earned over the license period 
accounts receivable includes an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is an estimate of amounts that may not be collectible 
this estimated allowance is based on historical trends  review of aging categories and the specific identification of certain customers that are at risk of not paying 
actual write offs of bad debt have historically been insignificant  less than of revenues 
certain costs and related obligations of the company are based on actuarial assumptions  including some of its pension plans and the cost of the company s postretirement medical plan  which provides lifetime health care benefits to retirees who meet specified length of service and age requirements 
these benefit costs are expensed over the employee s expected employment period 
at december   the company s postretirement retiree medical benefit obligation was million  which is not funded as it is the company s policy to fund postretirement medical costs as claims are incurred 
in determining the cost of retiree medical costs  some factors that management must consider include the expected increase in health care costs  discount rates and turnover and mortality rates 
the discount rate is based on the yield of long term corporate bonds at december  while other assumptions are updated periodically based on recent actual trends 
increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and increased the cost for by million 
conversely  a one percentage point decline in assumed health care cost trend rates would have lowered the benefit obligation at the end of by million and the cost for by million 
a one quarter of one percentage point decrease in the company s expected discount rate in would have increased retiree medical expense by approximately million 
the majority of the company s employees who meet specific length of service requirements are covered by defined contribution retirement plans 
substantially all employees who are not covered by these plans are covered by defined benefit pension plans based on length of service and age requirements 
at december   the company s 
table of contents accumulated pension benefit obligation was million  of which million was funded 
in determining the cost and obligation of the defined pension benefit plans  management must consider such factors as the expected return on plan assets  discount rates and expected employee salary increases 
while the company believes its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or changes in these assumptions would affect the calculation of its projected obligation and cost under the defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans 
the company evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually 
a one quarter of one percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on the company s plan assets in would have increased pension expense by approximately million 
a one quarter of one percentage point decrease in the company s expected discount rate in would have increased pension expense by approximately million 
management must use its judgment in assessing whether the carrying value of certain long lived assets  cost method investments  identifiable intangibles and goodwill is impaired and if any asset is impaired  the extent of any such loss 
certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and require an impairment review 
based on that review  if the carrying value of these assets exceeds fair value and is determined to not be recoverable  an impairment loss representing the amount of excess over its fair value would be recognized in income 
fair value estimates are based on quoted market values in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
management also exercises judgment in determining the estimated useful life of long lived assets  specifically plant  property and equipment and certain intangible assets with a finite life 
the company depreciates the cost of buildings over years  improvements to the buildings over years  software over to years and machinery and equipment over to years 
the year life is applicable to the company s press equipment 
the cost of leasehold improvements is depreciated over the lesser of the useful lives or the terms of the respective leases 
management bases its judgment on estimated lives of these assets based on actual experienced length of service of similar assets and expert opinions 
the company also uses expert opinions when determining whether an intangible asset has an indefinite life 
the company maintains a stock incentive plan under the dow jones long term incentive plan 
this plan provides for the grant of contingent stock rights  stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and other stock based awards 
the company accounts for its stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb and its related interpretations 
under apb  pretax stock based compensation charged to income principally in relation to the company s contingent stock rights and restricted stock awards was million in  million in and million in had the company s stock based compensation been determined by the fair value based method of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  the company s earnings per share for  and would have been reduced by roughly 
per share  
per share and 
per share  respectively 
management must exercise judgment in assessing the likely outcome of contingencies including those relating to tax matters and legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and those described in note to the financial statements 
both the timing and amount of the provisions made in the financial statements and related disclosures represent management s judgment of likelihood  based on information available at the time and on the advice of legal counsel 
judicial or governmental bodies largely determine the outcome of these matters 
the ultimate resolution of these matters  either by determinations by these bodies or other means  could be materially different from that assumed by the company in making its provisions and related disclosures 
the company records a tax valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
currently  the company maintains a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to its capital loss carryforward 
the company has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company subsequently determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made
