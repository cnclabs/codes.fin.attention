the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with vcampus consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview our revenues are derived from three primary sources online tuition revenues  development revenues  and other service revenues 
online tuition revenues are generated primarily from online tuition derived from corporate  government  and higher education customers 
development revenues consist primarily of fees paid to us for creating and developing new online courseware and web enabling existing courseware 
other service revenues consist primarily of monthly fees generated by the maintenance of the cybis courseware under contract with the us army 
on june   our board of directors approved a one for ten reverse stock split of our common stock 
the reverse stock split became effective as of the opening of trading on july  stockholders equity has been restated to give retroactive recognition to the reverse stock split for all periods presented by reclassifying the excess par value resulting from the reduced number of shares from common stock to paid in capital 
all references to common share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been retroactively restated to reflect the stock split 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are practices  information provided by our customers and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition we derive our revenues from the following sources online tuition revenues  other service revenues and development and other revenues 
revenue is recognized in accordance with either sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  or statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
both sab and sop generally require that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain sales  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
development and other revenues earned under courseware conversion contracts are recognized based on the ratio that total costs incurred to date bear to the total estimated costs of the contract 
management s estimates of total costs to complete contracts may be revised in future periods resulting in adjustments to revenue and profit recognized in the period the revisions are made 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of those customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
goodwill and other identifiable intangibles management assesses the recoverability of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when management determines that the carrying value of goodwill or other identifiable intangibles is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value can be estimated using a number of techniques including quoted market prices  valuations by third parties and discounted cash flow analysis 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  we ceased amortizing goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles on january  in lieu of amortization  these assets are subject to an annual impairment review 
we may determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles have been impaired  resulting in an impairment charge in the period the review is completed 
reclassification of revenues and sales and marketing expenses this report includes financial statements for reflecting a different classification of certain revenues and corresponding expenses from classifications in prior periods relating to our relationship with one of our largest customers 
amounts within the financial statements for and have been reclassified to conform to the new classification 
while this reclassification causes revenues and expenses reported herein to be lower than previously reported  it has no impact on our current or previously reported assets  liabilities or net loss 
in  we entered into an agreement with one of our largest higher education customers  pursuant to which we provide the technological platform and support for administering and delivering this customer s online degree program to its students 
this customer pays us a fee for each student registered in the program 
upon achieving certain student registration milestones under the program  pursuant to the terms of our renewal of this customer contract in  we thereafter contribute a fixed dollar amount per additional registration thereunder to a marketing and development fund jointly administered by us and our customer 
the development fund s primary goal is to fund marketing and development to grow online revenues for both that customer in the form of course registration fees and us in additional online tuition fees 
our treatment for this arrangement had been to recognize as revenue the entire portion of the online tuition fees received from this customer and then deduct the entire portion of our contributions to the development fund as a marketing expense 
based in part upon a financial analysis performed by management regarding the relative benefits received by us and our customer from the development fund  and based in part on management s assessment of the market price for the services we provide to our customer  assuming such services are provided with and then without the involvement of the development fund  we have determined that we should treat of the fund contributions as a reduction to revenue and the remaining of the fund contributions as a sales and marketing expense 
it is management s belief that the apportionment to revenues is appropriate based on our analysis 
the effect of this treatment was to reduce revenues  and sales and marketing expenses for the periods prior to the reclassification as follows by  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and by  for the six months ended june  this had no effect on our current or previously reported assets  liabilities  or net loss 
because we expect our relationship with this customer to terminate by may  we do not expect to recognize revenues from this client or pursuant to this arrangement after that date

interest expense in consists primarily of debt discount and deferred debt offering costs amortization related to remaining balance of the  and  convertible promissory notes issued in december and january  respectively 
interest income in was primarily derived from income earned on divestiture related notes receivable 
loss on debt extinguishment 
during  we issued  and  shares of series f and f preferred stock  respectively  plus five year fully vested warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share in exchange for the cancellation of two convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal and accrued interest amount of  the excess of the fair value of the preferred stock and warrants over the carrying value of the notes plus the write off of deferred debt issuance costs amounted to  and was recorded as loss on debt extinguishments in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
since our inception  we have financed our operating cash flow needs primarily through offerings of equity and debt securities and  to a lesser extent  borrowings 
cash utilized in operating activities was  in and  in use of cash was primarily attributable to the net loss recorded 
cash utilized in investing activities was  in and  in the use of cash for investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of equipment and investments in software and courseware development 
cash provided by financing activities was  in and  in in february  we raised  through the issuance of  and shares of series g preferred stock at a purchase price of per share to accredited investors and a placement agent  respectively 
under the terms of this financing  we also issued five year fully vested warrants to purchase  and shares of common stock at per share to the same accredited investors and placement agent  respectively 
in march  we raised  through the issuance of  shares of series g preferred stock at a purchase price of per share to accredited investors 
under the terms of this financing  we also issued five year fully vested warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share to the same accredited investors 
in may  we raised approximately  through the issuance of  shares of series h preferred stock at a purchase price of per share to accredited investors 
under the terms of this financing  we also issued five year fully vested warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share to the same accredited investors 
in september  we raised  through the private placement of  units  at a purchase price of per unit 
each unit consisted of one share of common stock and a three year warrant to purchase one share of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
in october  we raised an additional  through the sale of an additional  units at per unit 
in connection with this financing  we paid a placement agent a fee equivalent to of the amount raised  paid in units 
under the terms of the financing  because we did not raise an additional  in equity financing by november   on that date the unit holders became entitled to receive additional shares of common stock as if the purchase price per share of common stock had equaled when the units were purchased  and the exercise price of the warrants decreased to per share 
in march  vcampus raised  in gross cash proceeds through the private placement of units  at a purchase price of  per unit  and series b senior secured convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of  each unit consists of  shares of common stock initially priced at per share  a series a senior secured convertible note in the original principal amount of  and a five year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock 
we issued an additional  of series b senior secured notes in exchange for cancellation of existing short term indebtedness in that amount 
we issued to the series b noteholders five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the initial exercise price for the warrants is which is equal to the average closing price of vcampus common stock for the five trading days prior to the date of the closing 
upon shareholder approval of the private placement  the exercise price of the warrants would adjust to per share 
upon approval of the private placement by vcampus stockholders   of principal of each of the series a notes would automatically convert into common stock at per share and  or  in principal of each of the series b notes would automatically convert into common stock at per share 
the total principal amount for both series to be converted upon approval of the stockholders would be  therefore  assuming shareholder approval  a total of  of the placement would be categorized as equity and  as senior debt 
the notes mature on april  and bear interest at the rate of per annum payable quarterly in cash or stock at the conversion price at vcampus option for the first year 
principal and interest on the notes are payable in cash over the following four years in quarterly installments 
the notes do not become convertible into common stock unless and until stockholder approval is obtained 
the notes are subject to immediate redemption if stockholder approval is not obtained within days of closing 
we have sustained continuing operating losses in and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we expect negative cash flow from operations to continue until the online revenue stream matures 
we believe we have adequate capital from the march financing and access to adequate additional resources to fund operations until operations reach cash flow positive 
however  in the event revenues do not meet anticipated levels or we are unable to raise additional funding to meet working capital requirements  we may need to further reduce operating expenses 
if we are unable to raise additional funding to meet working capital requirements  we may be unable to maintain compliance with nasdaq smallcap market listing requirements and we might not be able to achieve our business objectives 
vcampus believes it has available capital on hand and sources for additional debt or equity capital in amounts necessary to meet its cash needs through and into however  such capital  if needed and available  may not have terms favorable to us or our current stockholders 
furthermore  the terms of the debt and equity financing conducted in march  which includes antidilution protection  may significantly hinder our ability to raise further capital in the future 
if we do not address our capital and funding needs  we will be materially adversely affected 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  acceptance of and demand for our products and services  maintenance and renewal of customer contracts  customer demands for technology upgrades  the types of arrangements that we may enter into with customers and agents  and the extent to which we invest in new technology and research and development projects 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes  which will expire at various dates through our ability to utilize all of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited by changes in ownership 
we have recognized a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets because it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will not be generated during the carryforward period available under the tax law to utilize the deferred tax assets 
contractual obligations our future liquidity and capital resources will be affected by our contractual obligations 
our significant contractual obligations as of december  are for debt and operating leases and purchase obligations 
these obligations are summarized as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years after years notes payable operating leases purchase obligation total contractual obligations in december and january  we raised  and  through the issuance of debentures together with five year  fully vested warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
we allocated the proceeds of the offering to the debentures and the warrants based on their relative fair values 
the amount allocated to the warrants was recorded as a debt discount and is being amortized to interest expense over the period the debentures are expected to be outstanding 
in march  we issued  shares of series f preferred stock and five year fully vested warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share in exchange for the cancellation of a note in the original principal amount of  plus  in accrued interest 
in may  we issued of  shares of series f preferred stock plus a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  in exchange for the cancellation of a convertible promissory note in the principal and accrued interest amount of  the unamortized debt discount at december  was the remaining  of principal and accrued interest under the debentures was due and payable at december  the  of debt was paid off in full in march in december  we entered into a three year subsequently amended to a four year reseller agreement with a vendor to resell certain courseware 
the agreement  as amended  requires us to generate sales of the vendor s courseware sufficient to generate royalties of  over the four year period 
as of december   we were required to generate sales sufficient to generate royalties of  prior to december  we have not engaged in off balance sheet financing or commodity contract trading 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to a variety of risks including market risk associated with interest rate movements 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to any investments the company may hold at various times and also related to its long term debt 
when investing  the company s purchases consist of highly liquid investments with maturities at the date of purchase generally no greater than twelve months  thus  due to the short term nature of such investments and the company s usual intention to hold these investments until maturity  the impact of interest rate changes would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
in addition  all of the company s long term debt obligations are at fixed interest rates 
given the fixed rate nature of the debt  the impact of interest rate changes also would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations
