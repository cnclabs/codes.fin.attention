item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes 
corporate profile flowserve corporation flowserve or the company is a global industrial company focused on flow control products and services 
flowserve was formed in by the merger of two publicly traded companies  durco international inc  durco  which became the successor company  and bw ip  inc bw ip 
we are incorporated in the state of new york and are headquartered in irving  texas  a suburb of dallas 
we have operations in countries and about  employees around the globe 
we are one of the world s leading providers of fluid motion and control products and services 
we produce engineered and industrial pumps  seals and valves and provide a range of related flow management services 
fluid motion and control products generally are used by our customers to regulate the movement of liquids or gases through processing systems in their facilities 
the industries we serve include oil and gas  chemical  power generation and water 
we also serve companies in the mining  pulp paper  food and beverage  steel  heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac and other industries 
we conduct our business through three business segments that represent our major product areas 
our flowserve pump division fpd produces  sells and services engineered and industrial pumps  as either complete units or parts 
this business has manufacturing facilities  of which are located in north america and in europe 
the remaining facilities are located in south america and asia 
fpd also has service operations  which are either free standing or co located in a manufacturing facility 
in  fpd had revenues of billion  of which approximately were from oil gas  power  water  chemical and general industry 
we are one of the world s leading suppliers of pumps to the oil gas  chemical and power industries 
based on independent industry sources  we believe that we are  on a global basis  the third largest industrial pump supplier 
we believe our ability to offer the broadest range of pumps for the petroleum  power and chemical markets  our strong customer relationships and our more than years of experience in pumping equipment are our major sources of competitive advantage 
this broad range of pump products is the result of the durco and bw ip merger and our acquisition of ingersoll dresser pump co idp 
in addition  fpd s reputation for providing quality engineering solutions for the most challenging customer application is a core strength 
our flow solutions division fsd produces  sells and services precision mechanical seals 
fsd has six manufacturing operations  four of which are located in north america and two are in europe 
the remaining operations are located in south america or asia 
fsd operates service locations  called quick response centers qrcs 
these qrcs generally are standalone facilities  with located in north america  in europe with the remainder principally located in south america and asia pacific 
fsd had revenues of million  of which approximately were from oil and gas  chemical and general industry 
our unmatched ability to turn around engineered seal products within hours from the customer s request  through design  engineering  manufacturing  testing and delivery  is our major source of competitive advantage 
based on independent industry sources  we believe that we are the second largest mechanical seal supplier on a global basis 
the flow control division fcd produces  sells and services industrial valves  manual valves  control valves  nuclear valves  valve actuators and valve automation controls 
fcd has manufacturing operations  of which five are located in the us and in europe 
the remaining operations are located in south america and asia 
we have valve service centers that are generally free standing and principally based in the us fcd had revenues of million  of which approximately were from chemical  power  oil and gas  water and general industry 
as a result of our acquisition of the flow control division of invensys plc ifc  we are one of the world s leading suppliers of valves and related products and services to the chemical industry 
based on independent industry sources  we believe that we are the second largest industrial valve supplier on a global basis 
we believe that our comprehensive portfolio of valve products and services is a key source of our competitive advantage 
further  our focus on service and severe corrosion and erosion applications is a key competency 
overview our markets we are dependent on the profitability and liquidity of our customers 
customer profitability is important because this usually means good demand for their products  which can lead them to expand their capacity through capital investments and enhance the efficiency of their operations through maintenance expenditures 
their liquidity is important as they also need access to cash resources  either through cash reserves or financing  to be able to invest in capital equipment such as pumps  valves and mechanical seals 
the oil and gas market represented about of our business in a high price in oil  above to per barrel  generally spurs additional investment in upstream petroleum projects 
typically  this is because the price of oil is driven by supply and demand 
this was the case for  as we saw an increase in bookings for oil projects  particularly in asia  africa and latin america 
despite the high price  in the middle east there were more limited expenditures for our products to this market  generally due to the iraq war and post war unrest throughout the region 
however  high oil prices often reduce the demand for our products and services from refiners who seek to take advantage of favorable refining margins by operating at high levels of capacity utilization and deferring maintenance until absolutely necessary 
clean fuels regulations  particularly in the us  have been a source of some project business from refiners 
however  the profitability of such projects is typically much lower than for maintenance related items 
despite high natural gas prices in  there was little additional investment or maintenance activity by our gas customers  many of which have experienced liquidity constraints as a result of financial difficulties related to their former energy trading activities 
as the results of these companies improve or they are otherwise recapitalized  we could see incremental business as the demand for natural gas remains high 
today  a number of companies are discussing potential investments in liquefied natural gas 
we would expect to benefit from a portion of this business 
for oil and gas  our outlook for is that our bookings could grow about based on forecasts provided by european industrial forecasting eif 
while high oil and gas prices are generally good for our oil and gas customers  they are generally adverse for chemical companies  since oil and natural gas are used to manufacture many of their products 
in  the price of natural gas in the us increased almost from this significantly reduced the profitability of our chemical customers  who faced high feedstock costs and weak demand due to the soft economy 
in response  they reduced their spending on capital investments and operated their facilities at lower levels  thus reducing the demand for our higher margin parts  replacement products and services 
if the economy improves  and demand for chemical based products increases  we expect to see some improvement in the demand for our products to the chemical industry 
further  this industry s improved profitability could spur new investment in other parts of the world such as asia  and we would expect to benefit from those investments as well 
in  the chemical industry represented about of our business 
based on forecasts provided by eif  our bookings for this market could grow about in increased natural gas prices also diminished the profitability of many power generators that in recent years made significant investments in power plants that generate electricity from natural gas 
while they have been able to recover a portion of their higher costs through rate increases  their liquidity is still challenged due to over investment in these power facilities 
however  a number of nuclear power generators are planning significant maintenance activities 
we have seen an increase in our orders for this area and expect it to be a positive contributor to orders and sales 
in addition  there are several coal fired power plants planned for the us and we are actively pursuing those opportunities 
the revenue opportunity for our products at a coal fired plant typically can be three times that of a natural gas power plant 
the power industry was approximately of our business in based on eif forecasts  our orders for this market could increase by in worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continues to create demand for new facilities or upgrades of existing systems requiring our products  especially pumps 
we believe that we are a global leader in the desalination market  which is an important source of fresh water in the mediterranean area and the middle east 
this is a significant market for our pumps and valve actuation products 
in  the water market represented about of our business 
based on eif forecasts  we estimate demand for our products for the water market could increase by in general industry represents a variety of different businesses  including mining  pulp paper  food and beverage  steel and hvac  none of which represents of total sales 
general industry comprised about of our business in some of these businesses  such as mining  pulp and paper and steel  appear to have experienced cyclical troughs in other industries such as food and beverage were relatively stable 
hvac was somewhat weaker due to a decline in the commercial real estate market 
in  some of these businesses that are tied to the economic recovery such as mining  pulp and paper and steel are expected to improve 
overall  based on eif forecasts  our bookings related to general industry could increase by in our customers include engineering contractors  original equipment manufacturers oems  end users and distributors 
sales to engineering contractors and oems are typically for project orders 
project orders generally have lead times greater than three months 
project orders provide product to our customers either directly or indirectly for their new construction projects or facility enhancement projects 
however  some distributor sales may also be for projects and some oem sales may be not be for projects 
the quick turnaround business  which we also refer to as the book and ship business  is defined as orders that are received from the customer booked and shipped within an approximate three month period 
they are typically for more standard products  parts or services 
each of our three segments generates this type of business 
our reporting of trends by product type  customer type and business type are based upon analytical review of individual operational results and our knowledge of their respective businesses as we do not track revenues by any of these categories 
our capital structure we could be viewed as a leveraged company as we have a non investment grade rating 
as a result  our ability to borrow additional funds and make investment decisions is limited by the terms of our credit agreement with our banks 
in that agreement  we must maintain certain minimum or maximum financial ratios specified in our covenants to be in compliance with the terms of the agreement 
if we fail to meet such ratios  we could seek a waiver and or amendment to these covenants  which would likely require a fee to our lenders 
we may also have to pay a higher rate of interest on our borrowings and  under particularly adverse circumstances  we could be forced to divest a portion of our business or be required to issue equity 
at this time  if we were to fail to meet such ratios  we believe our most likely action would be to seek  and likely obtain  a waiver and or amendment  as we have been consistently paying down more debt than required and our net debt to capital ratio has declined for three consecutive years 
in the second quarter of  we successfully obtained an amendment to our covenants to provide us with relief and more flexibility in certain areas 
our sources of operating cash include the sale of our products and services and the reduction of our working capital  particularly accounts receivable and inventories 
we have goals to continue to improve our working capital utilization through improved processes 
our goal for days sales receivables outstanding dso is days  compared with an actual dso of days at the end of based on sales  achieving this goal could provide approximately million in cash 
our objective for inventory turns is to improve by approximately one full turn per year  from turns actual at year end in the last year  our inventory turns were flat with based on data  an improvement of one turn would yield about million in cash 
we continue to manage our investment in property  plant and equipment 
in  our capital expenditures were million  or of depreciation 
major investments in our facilities are not considered to be necessary as we have excess capacity 
in addition  as we have consolidated facilities through acquisition integration over the last several years  we have upgraded the equipment in the remaining facilities with better equipment from the closing facilities 
in  we anticipate capital expenditures  excluding any acquisition activity  to approximate million  which is slightly higher than in we have a us defined benefit pension plan that is expected to require contributions in excess of related expense for the foreseeable future 
in  contributions were million  compared with expense of million 
higher contributions are necessary due to reduced investment returns from the plan in through and a relatively high level of lump sum payouts from the plan as we have continued to reduce our workforce 
contributions to our us pension plan in are likely to range between million and million 
we plan to continue to fund our pension plan to a level that is at least of our current benefit obligation as defined by us pension rules and regulations 
our strategies organic growth 
we have a number of initiatives directed at growing our business at a faster pace than that of our end markets 
of these  our end user initiative is the most significant 
it is based on a highly successful model used by our mechanical seals business for many years 
the foundations of this initiative are local customer support  rapid response and customer alliances 
these customer alliances are designed to create a win win opportunity for us and our customers 
these alliances focus on decreased down time for our customers facilities and a high and relatively consistent market share for us 
our seal business has increased its market share during the last several years through this focus 
we are expanding this approach to our pump business 
this is being done through common end user customer sales force management 
in our valve business  this initiative is being pursued through total portfolio management 
to facilitate this approach  our valve sales force is now organized by industry rather than brands or products 
process excellence 
we also have a number of initiatives focused on process excellence 
they include supply chain  our continuous improvement process cip and our flowserve management system fms 
in the area of supply chain  we have focused on leveraging our purchases and increasing supply from lower cost areas 
cip combines lean manufacturing and theory of constraints with six sigma tools and change management 
to date  about of our associates have been trained in these techniques 
fms is a management system developed to align each employee s goals with our strategies 
this system began in late and was initially implemented at the division  or in some cases the operating unit level 
in  we expanded fms training and tools to more associates 
we believe that tighter alignment between individual goals and corporate strategies should increase the effectiveness of our initiatives in the future 
for  we estimate cost reductions from these process improvement initiatives were about million  or of our costs 
in  we have a goal of about million in cost reductions related to these initiatives 
globalization 
we believe that our future success will be dependent on the global diversity of our business 
an important globalization initiative is to expand our presence in faster growing markets such as asia  latin america and africa 
we are adding resources in these regions to better serve our customers there 
in the area of supply chain management  we have focused on increasing our supply from lower cost areas such as india  china  mexico  latin america and eastern europe 
in addition  we have projects to increase outsourcing to centers of excellence in such places as india for engineering and back office functions and improve local service to our customers 
another strategy is the expansion of our presence in under represented markets such as asia  latin america  africa  india  china  mexico and eastern europe 
we are adding resources in these regions to better serve our customers there 
acquisition growth 
since  we have expanded through a number of acquisitions 
the industry in which we participate continues to be very fragmented 
while we believe that we are the third largest pump company  our share of the pump industry is only about 
as the second largest valve and second largest mechanical seal businesses  our estimated market shares are and  respectively 
these estimated market shares are based upon the total addressable market for pumps  valves and seals  which is broader than the markets currently served by our products and applications 
we expect to continue to grow through acquisitions 
in  we expect to limit our acquisitions to smaller companies million or less in revenues within the flow control industry that are considered to be bolt ons  and thus require little operational integration 
we make acquisitions to broaden our product range to current customers  expand our reach in faster growing markets  add capabilities that enable us to serve current customers more efficiently or effectively  and reduce our manufacturing footprint through consolidation of facilities 
we may also consider the divestiture of certain smaller parts of our business that have more limited growth potential or are not considered to be a core competency 
organizational capability 
to continue to grow  we acknowledge the need to continuously build and enhance our human resources 
a number of initiatives are focused in this area  including performance management  diversity  career planning and training and development 
we designed these programs to expand our capabilities to meet the challenges of a solutions oriented business in a highly competitive  global environment 
our approach to compensation and benefits is to be market competitive  underpinned by higher rewards for higher performers 
our results of operations in general  and consolidated results and the flow control division results were higher than the corresponding period in the previous year due to the impact of the acquisition of ifc  which took place on may  the results for ifc subsequent to that date are included in the results for our flow control division 
the ifc acquisition is discussed in further detail in the liquidity and capital resources section of this management s discussion and analysis 
pro forma results for and referenced throughout this management s discussion and analysis assume that the acquisition of ifc occurred on january  and include estimated purchase accounting and financing impacts 
all pro forma information is provided solely to enhance understanding of the operating results  not to purport what our results of operations would have been had such transactions or events occurred on the dates specified or to project our results of operations for any future period 
pro forma information should not be considered an alternative to operating results calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
sales in millions of dollars sales    pro forma sales    sales increased in which reflects the impact of about million of a full year s inclusion of ifc sales compared with eight months in the prior year and favorable currency translation benefits of about million resulting from the strengthening of international currencies  particularly the euro against the us dollar 
pro forma sales in were flat but would have been down absent the currency translation benefit of about 
partially offsetting these positives were lower sales of quick turnaround business into the chemical and general industrial sectors attributable to the us recession and to a lesser extent the european recession in the latter half of the year 
sales into these sectors have declined for each of the past three years 
the quick turnaround business is generally booked and shipped within an approximate three month period 
we believe that the weakness in this business is due to customer deferrals of plant maintenance and a lower level of capacity utilization due to partial or complete plant closures 
chemical and industrial pumps  valves and mechanical seals and related services are most dependent on this quick turnaround business 
sales into the power and water markets also declined in additionally  replacement parts and services into the middle east and venezuela decreased in due to post war unrest and political unrest  respectively 
sales increased in which reflects the impact of the ifc acquisition 
pro forma sales including ifc were down in in  currency translation impacts were negligible as benefits associated with the strengthening of the euro were offset by devaluation of latin american currencies 
the decline in pro forma sales reflects weaker sales into the power market as well as lower sales of quick turnaround products and services into the chemical and general industrial sectors 
however  sales of mechanical seals increased million in compared with sales to international customers  including export sales from the us  were approximately of sales in compared with of sales in and in sales into europe  the middle east and africa in increased to from in the prior year predominantly due to favorable currency translation and increased project business 
ifc s proportionately higher mix of international operations contributed to the increase 
absent currency translation impacts  we believe that our sales to international customers will continue to increase as a percentage of total sales as our highest revenue growth opportunities are in asia  latin america and africa 
bookings and backlog in millions of dollars bookings    pro forma bookings    backlog pro forma backlog bookings  or incoming orders for which there are customer purchase commitments  increased in the improvement reflects the impact of the ifc acquisition of about million and an approximate million benefit from currency translation 
pro forma bookings in increased 
in addition to the currency translation impact  the improvement in reflects an increase in upstream petroleum projects  particularly within asia  west africa and the cis 
however  bookings in were unfavorably impacted by reduced demand for products and services to chemical  power and general industrial customers 
additionally  bookings in into the middle east and venezuela were lower due to the political and economic turmoil in those regions 
bookings in increased  reflecting the impact of the ifc acquisition 
pro forma bookings in declined by 
the decline reflected reduced demand for products and services to chemical  power and general industrial customers 
backlog in of million increased compared with an increase of in backlog represents the accumulation of uncompleted customer orders 
by the end of  we expect to ship over of this backlog 
the backlog increase resulted from currency translation benefits of about as well as increased bookings during as previously discussed 
the increase in backlog in reflects the ifc acquisition 
on a pro forma basis  including ifc  backlog decreased by in due to lower pro forma bookings despite favorable currency translation 
gross profit and gross profit margin in millions of dollars gross profit gross profit margin pro forma gross profit pro forma gross profit margin gross profit in increased which reflects the full year impact of the ifc acquisition of approximately million  million of lower incentive compensation and currency translation benefits of about million 
partially offsetting these benefits were the impacts of unfavorable product mix and an estimated million increase associated with lower overhead absorption due to estimated lower unit volume 
pro forma gross profit in decreased and pro forma gross profit margin declined basis points 
despite the benefit from currency translation  the decline in gross profit and gross margin reflects the negative impact of a less profitable product mix as well as million of increased operating variances associated with lower overhead absorption due to lower unit volumes 
customer market factors discussed above contributed to the reduced demand for our products which yielded lower unit volumes 
the profitability of the product mix has eroded in each of the past three years due to higher volumes of less profitable project business  and in  increased warranty expense of about million associated with more warranty claims 
additionally  the product mix contained lower volumes of higher margin parts and quick turnaround business  including lower volumes of historically more profitable chemical and industrial pumps  industrial valves and service related activities 
the quick turnaround business is generally related to more standard products  parts and services 
the volumes of this business decreased due to reduced profitability of customers in chemical  general industrial  gas pipeline  power and refining industries 
these customers are operating under lower volume conditions or unfavorable price positions due to the economy  unfavorable cost positions due to higher raw material costs or currency  or a combination of the factors above 
in  these impacts were partially offset by ifc cost savings synergies of an estimated million 
material price inflation was relatively flat throughout the three year period 
however  in the latter part of  costs for certain raw materials  particularly metal alloys and nickel  began to increase 
these cost increases for raw materials represent approximately to percent of our total material expenditures 
we believe we can offset much of these cost increases through price increases on our products and other material cost reduction initiatives 
however  there can be no assurances that these and other potential material price increases will not impact gross profit in the future 
gross profit in increased  reflecting the impact of the ifc acquisition despite an estimated unfavorable currency impact 
pro forma gross profit declined from the prior year 
pro forma gross profit margin declined basis points during which reflects the less profitable product mix and lower overhead absorption 
additionally  gross profit and related margin were impacted in by a negative million purchase accounting adjustment associated with the required write up and subsequent sale of inventory resulting from the acquisition of ifc 
however  this was partially offset by the benefit of implementing sfas no 
and no 
 which improved gross profit by million in selling  general and administrative sg a expense in millions of dollars sg a expense sg a expense as a percentage of sales pro forma sg a expense pro forma sg a expense  as a percentage of sales in  sg a expense increased  which reflects a full year effect of the ifc acquisition of about million and negative currency translation impacts of approximately million and approximately million of increased legal  professional  consulting and associated expenses  partially offset by improved earnings in unconsolidated affiliates  lower incentive compensation of million and the impact of general cost savings initiatives 
pro forma sg a expense in increased 
absent currency translation  pro forma sg a expense decreased during the reduction in pro forma sg a expense reflects improved earnings in unconsolidated affiliates  lower incentive compensation expense of million in and an estimated million of synergy benefits associated with the ifc integration program and the impact of general cost savings initiatives  offset in part by increased legal  professional  consulting and associated expenses of approximately million 
sg a expense in increased due to the ifc acquisition 
however  pro forma sg a expense declined by about 
the reduction in pro forma sg a expense in reflects an million benefit associated with discontinuing the amortization of goodwill in conjunction with the implementation of sfas no 
and no 
 offset by higher commissions associated with higher sales levels and increased maintenance expenses 
integration and restructuring expense in millions of dollars integration expense restructuring expense the integration and restructuring expenses in and relate to the integration of ifc into the flow control division 
we have largely completed our restructuring and integration programs related to ifc  except for final severance payments and payments for other exit activities primarily related to european integration activities 
integration expense of million and restructuring expense of million reversed in relate to the integration of idp into the flowserve pump division 
the idp integration program was more expansive than the ifc program  resulting in higher costs 
see page of this management s discussion and analysis for further discussion on integration and restructuring expenses 
operating income in millions of dollars operating income operating income as percentage of sales pro forma operating income pro forma operating income as a percentage of sales operating income decreased in pro forma operating income decreased in despite currency translation benefits of an estimated million  the decline in operating income reflects the impact of weak market conditions which resulted in lower demand and sales for chemical  power and general industrial market products and services  our more profitable businesses 
in addition  an increase in unfavorable absorption variances of about million  higher warranties of about million  approximately million of higher legal  professional  consulting and associated expenses and increased integration and restructuring expenses of million negatively impacted operating income 
these impacts were partially offset by estimated incremental synergy benefits of million associated with the ifc integration program 
synergy savings associated with the ifc integration at december  are estimated to be at least million annually 
operating income of million in improved  reflecting the ifc acquisition  lower integration and restructuring expenses of million and a benefit of million associated with cessation of amortization of goodwill and trademarks associated with sfas absent the benefit of sfas  the decrease in operating income reflects weaker business conditions resulting in lower volumes and the resulting overhead underabsorption 
interest expense and loss on repayment of debt in millions of dollars interest income interest expense loss on debt repayment and extinguishment interest income increased during and due to higher average cash balances 
interest expense decreased in  compared with a decrease of in the reduction in interest expense reflects lower prevailing interest rates and reduced debt levels associated with optional and scheduled debt paydowns since the acquisition of ifc as well as lower borrowing spreads associated with the renegotiation of our revolving credit facility in april at december  approximately of our debt was at fixed rates  including the effects of million of notional interest rate swaps 
the reduction of interest expense in also resulted from lower debt levels associated with the repayment of one third of the then outstanding senior subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of using proceeds from a sale of our common shares 
during  we incurred losses of million on debt repayments and extinguishment related to the accelerated write off of unamortized prepaid financing fees resulting from million of optional debt repayments throughout the year 
in  we incurred million of such losses resulting from the debt amendments required pursuant to the ifc acquisition during the second quarter and from optional debt repayments during the third and fourth quarters 
in  we incurred such losses as a result of the early extinguishment of million of senior subordinated notes  using proceeds from the sale of our common shares 
prior to our adoption of sfas no 
on january   these losses were reported as extraordinary items in the statement of operations  however  the and amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation  as required under the new standard 
we expect to incur additional non cash losses as we continue to prepay debt 
we currently anticipate that interest expense could be at the level or less due to continued expected debt prepayments 
tax expense and tax rate in thousands of dollars tax expense benefit   effective tax rate the reduction in the effective rate is primarily due to us tax refunds received during the year which had not been previously recognized as a benefit 
in  the significant effective tax rate drivers include a benefit related to the extraterritorial income exclusion and the elimination of goodwill amortization resulting from our implementation of sfas no 
the relatively low earnings levels in compared with and magnified the impact of unfavorable permanent differences resulting in the effective tax rate for our effective tax rate is based upon current earnings  estimates of future taxable earnings for each domestic and international location and the estimated impact of tax planning strategies 
changes in any of these and other factors  in particular our ability to utilize foreign tax credits  could impact the tax rate in future periods 
we have foreign tax credits of million  all fully reserved  which expire in through additionally  foreign tax credits of million expiring in and million expiring in have been partially reserved 
should we be able to realize these credits  we would reverse the related valuation allowance which would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate 
should we not be able to utilize all or a portion of these credits  we would lose the benefit which would have a negative impact on our effective tax rate 
we expect our effective tax rate to be between and in  although it is dependent upon the mix of earnings between our domestic and international locations  our tax planning strategies and our ability to utilize foreign tax credits 
net earnings and earnings per share in millions of dollars  except per share amounts net earnings loss earnings loss per share diluted average diluted shares net earnings increased in due to lower levels of interest expense  loss on debt repayments and integration and restructuring expense  offset in part by the impact of lower sales volume and resultant lower gross margin as well as higher sg a 
earnings per share in were negatively impacted by a higher average diluted share count 
net earnings in increased million which reflects the ifc acquisition  benefit of sfas no 
and no 
and reduced interest  integration and restructuring expenses 
the implementation of sfas no 
and no 
resulted in an increase to net earnings of million  or per share  to earnings in earnings per share in were negatively impacted by a higher average diluted share count 
the increase in average diluted shares reflects the full year weighted average impact from the equity offering completed in april to finance the ifc acquisition 
the increase in reflects the full year impact of our equity offering completed in november  the proceeds of which were used to retire debt 
other comprehensive income in millions of dollars other comprehensive income expense other comprehensive income improved in  which reflects the strengthening of the euro  improved pension plan asset returns and more beneficial hedging results 
in  the improvement reflected increased net earnings and a favorable foreign currency translation adjustment resulting from the strengthening of the euro  partially offset by declines in the value of pension plan assets 
business segments we evaluate segment performance based on operating income excluding special items 
we believe that special items  while indicative of efforts to integrate ifc and idp into our business  do not reflect ongoing business results 
earnings before special items are not a recognized measure under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to gaap measures of performance 
the key operating results for our three business segments  flowserve pump division fpd  flow solutions division fsd and flow control division fcd are discussed below flowserve pump division in millions of dollars bookings    sales    operating income before special items integration expense restructuring expense segment operating income after special items segment operating income before special items as a percentage of sales backlog operating income in is before special items 
there were no special items in or bookings of pumps  pump parts and services for the flowserve pump division fpd in increased 
the improvement in bookings reflects favorable currency translation of about and an increase in upstream petroleum projects  particularly within asia  west africa and the cis 
in addition  nuclear power bookings improved in these benefits were offset by lower bookings in the us of quick turnaround business for the chemical and general industrial sectors  which declined each year over the three year period 
additionally  parts bookings  particularly into the middle east and venezuela  were down in the decline in bookings in reflects lower bookings of quick turnaround business for the chemical  general industrial and power sectors of the business as mentioned above 
sales declined by during currency translation favorably impacted sales by about in in addition  project sales into the oil and gas markets increased 
however  these benefits were more than offset by a lower level of backlog at the beginning of which was down lower than the prior year  as well as lower bookings of quick turnaround and after market business as discussed above 
sales in were above the prior year due to higher shipments of engineered pump projects  particularly in the petroleum and water markets  which were in backlog at the beginning of sales in were also adversely impacted by weak market conditions in the power  chemical and general industrial sectors of the business 
fpd segment operating income decreased by in  compared with a decrease in the decline in operating income reflects lower sales of absent estimated favorable currency effects of  a lower mix of historically more profitable chemical and general industrial product sales and services  lower after market shipments into the middle east and venezuela  unfavorable overhead absorption of about million due primarily to lower unit volumes and higher warranty costs of about million 
segment operating income in benefited by million from the implementation of sfas no 
and no 
 but declined due to the aforementioned weak market conditions  which impacted results in each of the past three years 
in addition  unfavorable overhead absorption impacted results in by about million due to lower production volumes and reductions in finished goods inventory in the facilities that manufacture pumps for the chemical  power and general industrial sectors 
flow solutions division in millions of dollars bookings sales segment operating income segment operating income as a percentage of sales backlog bookings of seals for the flow solutions division fsd increased in  which reflects a currency translation benefit of approximately 
bookings in increased 
the bookings improvement in both years reflects the division s emphasis on end user business and its success in establishing longer term customer alliance programs  including fixed fee alliances  despite weakened market conditions 
fixed fee alliances are contractual agreements with customers wherein the customer pays us a fixed amount each period usually monthly for the term of the agreement 
in return for this fixed cost  the customer is entitled to new seals  repairs  upgraded equipment  replacements and maintenance services as defined within the scope of each agreement 
we believe that this emphasis combined with heightened levels of service  reliability and innovation have contributed to an increase in market share in and we are currently implementing this end user strategy in our other divisions 
sales for fsd increased by in compared with a increase in the improvement in reflects currency translation benefits of approximately  offset by the impact of lower demand caused by weaker market conditions particularly within the chemical industry and us refineries 
despite weaker business conditions  fsd sales improved in  reflecting the benefits of the aforementioned customer focus  end user strategy and estimated favorable currency effects of 
fsd segment operating income in increased 
the improvement reflects currency translation benefits of  the increase in sales and the absence of million of performance incentive expense due to our weak consolidated performance compared with plan in segment operating income improved in the improvement in reflected the benefit of the sales increase of and the impact of continuous improvement process projects in both years 
additionally  increases in plant efficiencies resulted from bringing previously outsourced production in house  generally at only variable cost 
operating income in also benefited by million from the implementation of sfas no 
and no 
flow control division in millions of dollars bookings sales segment operating income before special items integration expense restructuring expense purchase accounting adjustment for inventory segment operating income after special items segment operating income before special items as a percentage of sales backlog pro forma bookings pro forma sales pro forma segment operating income before special items pro forma segment operating income before special items as a percentage of sales bookings of valves and related products and services for the flow control division fcd increased by in due to the full year impact of the ifc acquisition of million and an estimated currency translation benefit 
pro forma bookings for were about flat 
the decline in bookings absent currency benefits reflects weakness in the chemical  power and general industrial markets in approximately of fcd bookings are in these markets  which declined in both and additionally  was adversely impacted by the absence of an unusually large nuclear power order from of approximately million 
bookings increased in due predominantly to the ifc acquisition 
pro forma bookings in declined reflecting market weakness 
sales increased in compared with an increase of in  primarily due to full year impact of ifc of about million 
sales in were about flat with pro forma  which was down from pro forma currency translation provided an estimated benefit for sales in both years were adversely affected by reduced customer demand for valve products and services in the power  chemical and general industrial sectors of the business 
fcd segment operating income in increased 
the improvement reflects the ifc acquisition as well as currency translation benefits of about 
pro forma segment operating income increased 
in addition to currency translation  the improvement reflects estimated incremental synergy benefits of million in synergy savings associated with the integration are estimated to be at least million annually 
we have largely completed the integration of ifc 
see restructuring and acquisition related charges of this management s discussion and analysis for a detailed discussion on the ifc integration program 
these benefits were offset by the impact of lower unit volumes and an unfavorable mix of product sales 
segment operating income in increased  but pro forma segment operating income declined 
operating income in  before special items  benefited by million from the implementation of sfas no 
and no 
the decline in operating results in on a pro forma basis reflected the decline in sales due to weak conditions in the chemical  power and general industrial markets  as well as lower production throughput due to lower sales volume combined with a reduction of finished goods inventories  which resulted in unfavorable manufacturing absorption variances 
segment operating income we evaluate segment performance based on segment operating income  which is operating income excluding special items 
segment operating income provides the most meaningful measure of operating performance since it eliminates expenses associated with strategic corporate decisions not directly associated with ongoing segment performance and since such expenses are closely related to our plans to purchase and integrate our acquisitions 
special items during and are all associated with the acquisition of ifc into the flow control division 
special items during are related to the august acquisition of idp into the flowserve pump division 
the following summarizes special items excluded from the calculation of segment operating income during the three year period ended december  year ended december  in millions of dollars integration expense restructuring expense purchase accounting adjustment for inventory total restructuring and acquisition related charges restructuring costs ifc in conjunction with the ifc acquisition during  we initiated a restructuring program designed to reduce costs and eliminate excess capacity by closing valve facilities  including service facilities  and reducing sales and related support personnel 
our actions  some of which were approved and committed to in with the remaining actions approved and committed to in  are expected to result in a gross reduction of approximately positions and a net reduction of approximately positions 
net position eliminations represent the gross positions eliminated from the closed facilities offset by positions added at the receiving facilities  which are required to produce the products transferred into the receiving facilities 
we believe we have achieved at least million of annual run rate savings as a result of our integration program 
run rate savings reflect the quantification of cost saving synergies achieved at december  on an annualized basis 
the synergy savings reflect the benefit of lower payroll and benefit costs resulting from the net position eliminations  partially offset by increased outsourcing costs  and elimination of fixed costs at the closed facilities including depreciation  utilities  lease expense  insurance  taxes and other fixed costs 
we established a restructuring program reserve of million upon acquisition of ifc  and increased the reserve by a total of million in the latter half of we recognized additional accruals of million in for this program  primarily related to the closure of certain valve service facilities and the related reductions in workforce 
cash expenditures against the accrual were million in and million in the remaining accrual of million reflects payments to be made in and beyond for severance obligations due to terminated personnel in europe of million as well as lease and other contract termination and other exit costs of million 
cumulative costs of million associated with the closure of flowserve facilities through december   have been recognized as restructuring expense in operating results  whereas cumulative costs associated with the closure of ifc facilities of million  including related deferred taxes of million  became part of the purchase price allocation of the transaction 
the effect of these closure costs increased the amount of goodwill otherwise recognizable as a result of the ifc acquisition 
the following illustrates activity related to the ifc restructuring reserve amounts in millions severance other exit costs total balance created on june  additional accruals cash expenditures balance at december  additional accruals cash expenditures balance at december  integration costs ifc during and  we also incurred acquisition related integration expense in conjunction with ifc  which is summarized below amounts in millions personnel and related costs transfer of product lines asset impairments other ifc integration expense cash expense non cash expense ifc integration expense the acquisition related activities resulted in integration costs as categorized above and further defined as follows 
personnel and related costs include payroll  benefits  consulting fees  and retention and integration performance bonuses paid to our employees and contractors for the development  management and execution of the integration plan 
transfer of product lines includes costs associated with the transfer of product lines as well as realignment required in the receiving facilities 
asset impairments reflect the loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment at the facilities closed and disposal of inventory for discontinued product lines when the facilities were combined 
the other category includes costs associated with information technology integration  legal entity consolidations  legal entity name changes  signage  new product literature and other 
none of these items individually amounted to greater than million 
remaining restructuring and integration costs ifc we have largely completed our restructuring and integration programs related to ifc  except for payments for certain european activities 
we expect to incur no additional restructuring and integration costs in connection with this program 
payments from the restructuring accrual will continue into and due to the timing of severance obligations in europe 
restructuring costs idp in august  in conjunction with the idp acquisition  we initiated an integration program designed to reduce costs and eliminate excess capacity by closing or significantly downsizing eight pump manufacturing facilities and eight service and repair facilities  closing idp s former headquarters  and reducing redundant sales  administrative and related support personnel 
these actions  approved and committed to in  resulted in the gross reduction of  positions and a net reduction of  positions 
net positions reflect the gross positions eliminated from the closed facilities offset by positions added at the receiving facilities required to produce the products transferred into the receiving facilities 
as a result of these activities  we generated approximately million of annual synergy savings 
the savings reflect the benefit of lower payroll and benefit costs resulting from the net position eliminations  partially offset by increased outsourcing costs  and elimination of fixed costs at the closed facilities including depreciation  utilities  lease expense  insurance  taxes and other fixed costs 
we completed our idp related integration and restructuring activities during  and substantially completed the expenditures thereunder as of december  we recognized million in restructuring costs  comprised of million related to the idp operations acquired and million related to flowserve operations 
the million related to idp operations  reduced by deferred tax effects of million  resulted in recognition of million of incremental goodwill 
the million related to flowserve operations was recognized as restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of operations in and the following illustrates activity related to the idp restructuring reserve amounts in millions severance other exit costs total balance at august  cash expenditures reclassification of long term retirement benefits adjustment to accrual balance december  cash expenditures non cash reductions adjustment to accrual balance at december  cash expenditures non cash reductions balance at december  the majority of the funding of the restructuring activities was completed in revisions to the accrual were recorded in and to reflect actual results and changes in estimates including an incremental accrual in required based upon updated actuarial information for postretirement and pension expense relating to finalization of union negotiations for closed facilities 
of the final adjustment of million in  million related to flowserve facilities and was reflected as negative restructuring expense and the remaining million related to idp facilities and was recorded as a reduction to goodwill 
non cash reductions reflect reclassification from the restructuring accrual to post retirement benefits and pension liabilities in and to other accrued liabilities in and severance costs include costs associated with involuntary termination benefits  including enhancements to certain severed employees of long term retirement benefits of million  and costs related to exiting facilities that would provide no future benefit 
other exit costs of million included million of payroll and consulting costs to execute the closure program  million of facility clean up costs including environmental  million relocation costs for idp personnel  million of costs to physically dispose of patterns and equipment  and million of other costs including lease termination and legal costs 
integration costs idp during  we also incurred integration expense as follows amounts in millions personnel and related costs transfer of product lines asset impairments other idp integration expense cash expense non cash expense idp integration expense the acquisition related activities resulted in integration costs as categorized above and further defined as follows 
personnel and related costs include payroll  benefits  consulting fees  severances  and retention and integration performance bonuses paid to our employees and contractors for the development  management and execution of the integration plan 
transfer of product lines includes costs associated with the transfer of product lines as well as realignment required in the receiving facilities 
asset impairments reflect the loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment at the facilities closed and disposal of inventory for product lines discontinued when the facilities were combined

none of these items individually amounted to greater than million 
liquidity and capital resources overview of cash flows amounts in millions total operating cash flows net cash flows used by investing activities net cash flows provided used by financing activities cash flow analysis cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our existing revolving credit facility are our primary sources of short term liquidity 
our cash balance at december  was million  an increase of million from  which increased million from the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in primarily relates to pension contributions  income taxes and outflows related to the ifc integration 
in  contributions to us pension plans were million  compared with million in and million in in  we also benefited from receipt of a million us income tax refund compared with million received in cash outflows related to the ifc integration were million in compared with million in the increase in operating cash flows of million in from primarily relates to a million reduction in outflows for integration and restructuring  million of higher net earnings  receipt of a tax refund of million  million of lower interest and improvements in working capital 
working capital reductions provided operating cash flow of million in  and million in  but used million of cash flow in the reduction in working capital for reflects our continued emphasis on improving accounts receivable collections and reducing inventory 
accounts receivable reductions in generated million of cash flow compared with million in and million in the improvement in accounts receivable primarily reflects improved collections and lower sales volume 
in addition  incremental factoring of certain non us receivables contributed million in and million in days sales outstanding improved to days from days at december  and days at december  inventory reductions contributed million of cash flow for compared with million in the prior year 
the majority of the inventory reduction was in finished goods  offset in part by an increase in project related work in process inventory required to support shipments of products in backlog 
in  inventory was a million use of cash due to an increase in support of backlog for future shipments and increased finished goods safety stock to meet customer deliveries during the idp integration and during a systems conversion at a valve plant 
as a result of the inventory reduction  inventory turns were times at december  and compared with times at december  cash outflows from operating activities for were high due to payments associated with the idp integration program  including restructuring and integration payments of million and interest payments of million 
at december   we had drawn million of revolving credit primarily to fund integration activities and increases in working capital 
cash outflows for investing activities were million in  compared with million in and million in the decrease in results from the absence of acquisitions  partially offset by a lower level of receipts from disposals 
the increase in results primarily from the purchase of ifc  partially offset by lower capital expenditures 
cash outflows for financing activities were million in  compared with inflows of million in and million in the change in results from the absence of equity offerings in compared with and the increase in results from the issuance of equity and increased borrowings associated with the purchase of ifc 
we believe cash flows from operating activities combined with availability under our existing revolving credit agreement and our existing cash balances will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash flow needs for the next months 
however  cash flows from operations could be adversely affected by economic  political and other risks associated with sales of our products  operational factors  competition  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in interest rates  among other factors 
during and  we also generated million and million  respectively  of cash flow related to the exercise of employee stock options  which are reflected in financing activities of the consolidated statement of cash flows 
amounts in were not significant 
payments for acquisitions on may   we completed our acquisition of ifc for a contractual purchase price of million  subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement 
a reduction of million was agreed to and settled during the fourth quarter of  which yielded a final contractual purchase price of million 
the reduction related to the finalization of balances at the date of acquisition for cash  related party activity and tax payments 
in addition  we incurred million of costs associated with consummation of the acquisition including investment banking  legal  actuarial and accounting fees 
the total purchase price including such costs was million 
by acquiring ifc  one of the world s foremost manufacturers of valves  actuators and associated flow control products  we believe that we are the world s second largest manufacturer of valves 
we financed the acquisition and associated transaction costs by issuing million shares of common stock in april for net proceeds of approximately million and through new borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities 
the purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition 
we completed the purchase price allocation of ifc during and expect no further revisions 
these final allocations included million for amortized intangibles  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million recorded as goodwill 
the operating results of ifc have been included in the consolidated statements of operations from may   the date of acquisition 
we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities of various sizes 
the cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any acquisition  including our ability to raise economical capital  is a critical consideration in any such evaluation 
capital expenditures amounts in millions capital expenditures depreciation expense capital expenditures were funded primarily by operating cash flows and bank borrowings 
for each of the three years  capital expenditures were invested in new and replacement machinery and equipment  information technology and acquisition integration activities including structures and equipment required at receiving facilities 
in each year  capital expenditures were less than depreciation expense due to excess capacity and the upgrading of equipment through integration processes 
we expect this trend of low capital expenditures to continue for the next to years 
capital expenditures of approximately million are expected in financing debt  including capital lease obligations  consisted of december  amounts in thousands term loan tranche a us dollar tranche  interest rate of in and in euro tranche  interest rate of in and in  term loan tranche c  interest rate of in and in senior subordinated notes net of discount  interest rate of us dollar denominated   euro denominated   capital lease obligations and other debt and capital lease obligations   less amounts due within one year   total debt due after one year   maturities of debt  including capital lease obligations  for the next five years and beyond are amounts in thousands term loans senior subordinated notes capital leases other total thereafter    total    senior credit facility as of december  and  our senior credit facility is composed of a revolving credit facility and tranche a and tranche c term loans 
tranche a consists of a us dollar denominated tranche and a euro denominated tranche  the latter of which is a term note due in during  we made scheduled debt payments of million and optional debt prepayments of million  including million during the fourth quarter 
in  we also made million of mandatory and million of optional prepayments on the term loans 
we have scheduled tranche a principal payments of million in the first quarter of and million in each of the remaining quarters of however  as a result of the optional prepayments made in and  we have no scheduled payments on tranche c due until march   when million is due 
the following summarizes our repayment of obligations under the senior credit facility and  in  the senior subordinated notes amounts in millions mandatory repayment optional prepayment loss on debt repayment and extinguishment the senior credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our us assets and a pledge of of the stock of certain foreign subsidiaries 
the tranche a and tranche c loans  which were amended and restated in connection with the ifc acquisition  have final maturities of june and june  respectively 
the senior credit facility was amended during june to  among other things  delay the step downs in the maximum leverage ratio and the step ups in the minimum interest coverage ratio 
the term loans bear floating interest rates based on libor plus a borrowing spread  or the prime rate plus a borrowing spread  at our option 
the borrowing spread for the senior credit facility can increase or decrease based on the leverage ratio as defined in the facility and on our public debt ratings 
as part of our senior credit facility  we have a million revolving credit facility that expires in june the revolving credit facility allows us to issue up to million in letters of credit 
as of december  and  we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
however  we had issued million in letters of credit under the facility  which reduced our borrowing capacity of the facility to million at december  this compares with a borrowing capacity of million at december  we are required  under certain circumstances as defined in the credit facility  to use a percentage of excess cash generated from operations to reduce the outstanding principal of the term loans in the following year 
based upon the annual calculations performed at december   and  no additional principal payments became due in  or under this provision 
senior subordinated notes at december   we had million and eur million equivalent to million in face value of senior subordinated notes outstanding 
the senior subordinated notes were originally issued in at a discount to yield  but have a coupon rate of 
approximately one third of these senior subordinated notes were repurchased at a premium in utilizing proceeds from an equity offering  in accordance with the provisions of the indenture 
beginning in august  all remaining senior subordinated notes outstanding become callable by us at of face value  but otherwise are not due until interest on the senior subordinated notes notes is payable semi annually in february and august 
common stock offerings during  we financed the acquisition of ifc and associated transaction costs with a combination of bank financing and net proceeds of approximately million received from the issuance of million shares of common stock during april during  we completed an offering of approximately million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million  which were used to prepay million of the us dollar denominated senior subordinated notes  prepay eur million million of the euro denominated senior subordinated notes  and pay associated prepayment premiums and other direct costs 
during  we recorded an extraordinary item of million  net of million of tax  which represented the sum of the prepayment premiums  other direct costs  and the write off of unamortized prepaid financing fees and discount for the portion of the notes that was prepaid 
due to the adoption of sfas no 
on january   this item  totalling million on a pre tax basis  has been reclassified as a component of earnings before income taxes 
debt covenants and other matters the provisions of our senior credit facility require us to meet or exceed specified defined financial covenants  including a leverage ratio  an interest coverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
further  the provisions of these and other debt agreements generally limit or restrict indebtedness  liens  sale and leaseback transactions  asset sales and payment of dividends  capital expenditures and other activities 
our senior credit facility requires us to submit audited financial statements to the lenders within days of year end 
as a consequence of delays stemming from the restatement of our financial information for the nine months ended september  and the full years  and  we were unable to provide the audited financial statements within the specified period of time 
accordingly  we obtained a waiver from our lenders regarding this covenant and  accordingly  present the scheduled maturities under the facility due in and beyond as non current in the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we complied with all financial covenants under our debt facilities  as illustrated below an actual leverage ratio of compared with a permitted maximum of an actual interest coverage ratio of compared with a permitted minimum of  and an actual fixed charge ratio of compared with a required minimum of we have determined that at september   december  and march   we did not comply by basis points or less with two financial covenants in our then applicable credit agreement  which is no longer in effect 
we believe that we could have undertaken readily available actions to maintain compliance or obtained a waiver or amendment to the then existing credit agreement had we then known this situation 
except for these periods  we have complied with all covenants under our debt facilities 
we believe that this matter has no impact on our existing debt agreements and that our outstanding debt is properly classified in our consolidated balance sheet 
the maximum leverage ratio reduces to at september  and the minimum interest coverage increased to at march  we currently estimate that we will comply with the interest coverage covenant at march  by a small margin 
should our estimated earnings change  we may not comply with the interest coverage covenant and we may seek a waiver or an amendment to the senior credit facility in order to remain in compliance 
we believe that such waiver or amendment  should it be needed  would be approved by the requisite number of lenders  however  there can be no assurance that such a waiver or amendment would be granted 
we are not presently able to ascertain the cost and or conditions associated with receipt of such waiver or amendment 
under particularly adverse circumstances  we could be forced to divest a portion of our business or issue equity 
the following is a summary of net debt defined as debt less cash to capital at various dates since december  december  december  december  the net debt to capital ratio has decreased due to the impact of the common stock offerings  repayments of debt under the senior credit facility and increases in shareholders equity resulting from continued earnings and favorable foreign currency translation 
while the ifc acquisition increased the absolute level of indebtedness  we believe that our ability to service debt  as measured by our covenant ratios  debt ratings and net debt to capital ratios  has improved 
this is because we issued shares of common stock to finance a portion of the ifc acquisition 
additionally  under our senior credit facility covenant ratios  we receive credit for of the pro forma ebitda of ifc for the four quarter period prior to the acquisition  while incremental debt used to finance the acquisition was only about of the purchase price 
our lenders use ebitda as a surrogate for earnings and cash flows in our senior credit facility 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period amounts in millions within year years years beyond years total long term debt and capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations inventory non inventory other contractual obligations the following table presents a summary of our commercial commitments at december  commitment expiration by period amounts in millions within year years years beyond years total standby letters of credit surety bonds other commercial commitments we expect to satisfy these commitments through performance under our contracts 
pension and postretirement benefits obligations we sponsor several defined benefit pension plans and postretirement health care plans 
our recorded liability for these plans was million at december  and million at december  determination of the value of the pension and postretirement benefits liabilities is based on actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  regarding discount rates  life expectancy  expected return on plan assets and assumed rates of increase in wages and in health care costs 
current market conditions  including changes in rates of returns  interest rates and medical inflation rates  are considered in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions used and changes resulting from fluctuations in the number of plan participants 
we expect to fund contributions to the plans from operating cash flows 
primarily as a result of stronger market performance of pension plan assets in  we reduced our minimum pension liability by million  whereas in and as a result of an increase in the number of plan participants and poor investment performance  we increased our minimum pension liability by million and million  net of tax effects  respectively 
additionally  we expect to contribute between million and million into our qualified us pension plan during  although we could contribute as much as million 
because many of the non us plans are unfunded  as permitted by local law  the range of contributions is more difficult to pinpoint 
nonetheless  we expect to contribute approximately million to these plans during  based on prevailing exchange rates at december  we are still gathering consolidated information regarding our aggregate non us plans  for purposes of determining the impact of alternative actuarial assumptions to the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
however  the following provides a sensitivity analysis of alternative assumptions on the us pension and postretirement plans  which represent our most significant obligations 
effect of discount rate changes and constancy of other assumptions amounts in millions increase of decrease of us defined benefit pension plans effect on pension expense effect on projected benefit obligation post retirement medical plan effect on postretirement medical expense effect on projected benefit obligation effect of changes in the expected return on assets and constancy of other assumptions amounts in millions increase of decrease of us defined benefit pension plans effect on pension expense effect on projected benefit obligation post retirement medical plan effect on postretirement medical expense effect on projected benefit obligation our critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes contained within this k filing 
our more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
based on a critical assessment of accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our consolidated financial statements provide meaningful and fair perspective 
this is not to suggest that other general risk factors  such as changes in worldwide demand  changes in material costs  performance of acquired businesses and others  could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon the best information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions  including our historical experience  where relevant 
the estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions change within and beyond our control 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the most significant estimates made by management include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  deferred tax asset valuation  restructuring reserves  legal and environmental accruals  warranty accruals  pension and postretirement benefits obligations pbo and valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets 
the significant estimates are reviewed quarterly with our audit finance committee of the board of directors 
the following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and the related management estimates and assumptions necessary in determining the value of related assets or liabilities 
for a detailed discussion on the application of our accounting policies  see note in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues for products and short term contracts are recognized based on the shipping terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions required  which is the point of title transfer  unless the customer order requires formal acceptance under which circumstances revenue is not recognized until formal acceptance has been received 
revenue on service contracts is recognized after the services have been rendered and accepted by the customer 
all revenue for products  short term projects and service contracts require  prior to recognition  the persuasive evidence of an arrangement  a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectibility 
revenue for longer term contracts defined as contracts longer than nine months in duration where reasonably reliable estimates of cost can be made  with contract values over  and progress billings from the customer are recorded on the percentage of completion method calculated on a cost to cost basis 
we utilized percentage of completion revenue recognition for approximately of consolidated revenues 
this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  we make judgments to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in scheduled delivery and the cost of materials  labor costs and productivity  the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes  or achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract costs and losses  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
in certain instances  we provide guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria 
failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs  which could exceed revenues realized from the project 
in such instances  we might be required to record reserves to cover such excesses  which would adversely affect our results of operation and financial position 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable 
the amount of the allowance is determined based upon the aging of the receivable  customer credit history  customer disputes  outstanding industry and market segment information  economic trends and conditions  credit reports and customer financial condition 
we consider our historical collection history and specifically known uncollectible accounts in establishing our allowance 
customer credit issues  customer bankruptcies  general economic conditions or other matters largely beyond our control can affect the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
if our customers financial conditions worsened or if customer disputes increased beyond levels currently provided for  we might be required to incur additional write offs  which would adversely impact our results of operation  cash flows and financial position 
our credit risk may be mitigated by our large number of customers across many different geographic regions 
we currently have a credit insurance policy for our european subsidiaries  whereby we generally receive funds from the third party insurer  net of deductible  in instances where customers covered by this policy are unable to pay 
we periodically evaluate the creditworthiness of the credit insurer 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we determine cost for us inventories by the last in  first out lifo method and for other inventories by the first in  first out fifo method 
we estimate the market value of our inventory based on an assessment of recent sales prices  and provide for excess and obsolete inventories determined by historical usage and estimated future demand and related pricing 
in determining excess quantities  we consider recent sales activity  related margins and market positioning of our products 
these estimates are generally not subject to significant volatility  due to the long life cycles of our product lines  except for product rationalizations generally associated with acquisition integration programs 
however  factors beyond our control such as demand levels  technological advances and pricing competition could change from period to period 
if such factors had an adverse effect on us  we might be required to reduce the value of our inventory  which would adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
deferred tax asset valuation we recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating and capital loss carryforwards for us and us subsidiaries 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
we assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 
restructuring reserves restructuring reserves may be established in conjunction with an acquisition in circumstances where we intend to reorganize the company or the acquired business 
such reserves reflect many estimates including costs pertaining to employee separation  settlements of contractual obligations and other matters associated with exiting a facility 
under current accounting rules  restructuring costs related to facilities and employees of an acquired business generally become a component of goodwill  whereas restructuring costs associated with exiting an existing flowserve facility are recorded as restructuring expense in the statement of operations 
we assess the reserve requirements for each restructuring plan quarterly based on information gathered during due diligence regarding the restructured business assets and liabilities and our own prior experiences 
uncertainty exists in both the information gathered about the restructured business and the costs necessary to restructure and integrate the operations 
if additional costs prove necessary  we may be required to recognize additional expense  which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
legal and environmental accruals the costs relating to legal and environmental liabilities are estimated and liabilities recorded when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable 
we have a formal process for assessing the facts and recording any required reserves on a case by case basis 
assessments of legal and environmental reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in house experts including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations 
the recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes  due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter  changes in political environments  legal venue and other factors 
recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties  technological innovation and regulatory environment changes 
warranty accruals warranty obligations are based upon product failure rates  materials usage and service costs 
we estimate warranty provisions based upon an analysis of all identified or expected claims and an estimate of the cost to resolve those claims 
the estimates of expected claims are generally a factor of historical claims and known product issues 
changes in claim rates  differences between actual and expected warranty costs and facility rationalization activities could impact warranty obligation estimates  which might have adverse effects to our results of operations and financial position 
pension and postretirement benefits obligations determination of the value of our pension and postretirement benefits liabilities is based on actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions which are assessed annually in the fourth quarter and which include discount rates  expected return on plan assets for funded plans  life expectancy of participants  assumed rate of wage increases  and assumed rate of health care cost increases 
we evaluate  in conjunction with our professional advisors  prevailing market conditions in countries where plans are maintained  including appropriate rates of return  interest rates and medical inflation rates 
specifically for our us plan  we assess such market factors as changes in the cash balance interest crediting rate  borrowing rates for investment grade corporate and industrial companies  assumptions used by fortune companies  our actual wage increases in recent years  expected rates of return for each targeted asset class held by the plans and return premiums generated by active investment management 
for the non us plans  we perform similar analyses  but also factor in local laws and requirements 
we also compare our significant assumptions with our peers and discuss our key assumptions  prior to their incorporation into actuarial calculations  with the audit finance committee of the board of directors 
we evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations  cash flow requirements and other factors 
valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets our business acquisitions typically generate goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect prospective amortization expense and possible impairment expense we might incur 
we test the value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired 
the test involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units  which correlate to our operating segments 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units  we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and market data used in discounting those cash flows 
inherent uncertainties exist in determining and applying such factors 
the net realizable value of other long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  is reviewed periodically  when indicators of potential impairments are present  based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets  utilizing methodologies similar to that for goodwill and indefinite lived assets 
additional considerations related to our long lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements  changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if the fair values are less than our estimates  our assets could require a change  which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
business outlook for while we remain optimistic about our markets and our performance over the long term  our outlook for remains cautious 
the economic forecasts for many of our markets are expected to improve 
however  the rate and amount of improvement  market share and the mix of our business can impact our revenues and bookings in for additional discussion on our markets  reference the overview section on page of this management s discussion and analysis 
as a result of these factors  our revenues are expected to increase slightly from  absent currency fluctuations 
our operating income in should benefit from a number of operational improvement programs including procurement and continuous process improvement initiatives as well as other operational improvements in several of our facilities 
however  partially offsetting the benefits will be higher wage and benefit costs due to inflation and higher accruals associated with performance incentive programs  which were negligible in operating income could be impacted by changes in demand in our served markets 
in particular  increased demand for chemical or general industrial products  generally our quick turnaround and historically more profitable products  could improve our product mix and result in improved profitability 
additionally  increased demand in the middle east  most notably iraq  could improve our profitability 
in addition  accelerated implementation of our end user strategy could positively improve demand and resultant profitability 
conversely  declines in any of our markets could result in lower levels of profitability 
if we are not able to adequately offset material cost increases either through other material cost savings or through price increases  our profitability will be adversely impacted 
we do not expect to incur integration or restructuring expense in  which amounted to million pretax in at december   of our debt was floating rate debt 
we expect to evaluate opportunities to reduce the amount of floating interest rate debt in to reduce potential volatility in rates  which could negatively impact our effective interest rate 
as a result  interest expense could be at the level despite additional planned debt reductions 
we expect our effective tax rate to be between and in  although it is dependent upon the mix of earnings between our domestic and international locations  our tax planning strategies and our ability to utilize foreign tax credits 
if these factors occur as we have described  we expect that net earnings and earnings per share should improve in we expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our business  capital expenditures  pension plan contribution obligations and pay down debt at a level greater than the mandatory requirement through improved earnings and working capital 
we expect to improve working capital utilization as we reduce the days sales outstanding and increase inventory turns 
however  the amount of cash generated from working capital could be dependent on the level of revenues and other factors 
working capital requirements will change as our revenue changes  despite expected improvement in its utilization 
capital expenditures in will be focused on new product development  information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities and should be about million before consideration of any acquisition activity 
while current pension regulations allow us significant latitude in the amount of contributions  we currently anticipate that our contributions to our qualified us defined pension plan will be between million and million 
our mandatory debt payments in are million  however we anticipate reducing our debt by approximately million 
based upon this outlook  we expect to comply with our bank covenants including step downs in the required leverage ratio  which begin in the third quarter of  and step ups in interest coverage ratio which begin in the first quarter of further information regarding our debt covenants is presented in the financing section of liquidity and capital resources in this item accounting developments pronouncements implemented in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
generally  this pronouncement requires companies to recognize the fair value of liabilities for retiring their facilities at the point that legal obligations associated with their retirement are incurred  with an offsetting increase to the carrying value of the facility 
the expense associated with the retirement becomes a component of a facility s depreciation  which is recognized over its useful life 
we adopted sfas no 
on january   however  the adoption did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations due to limited abandonment and retirement obligations associated with our facilities 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the most significant impact of sfas no 
is to eliminate the requirement that gains and losses from debt extinguishment be classified as extraordinary items unless they are infrequent and unusual in nature 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and have reclassified previously reported extraordinary items from and  which relate to early extinguishment of debt  to become a component of earnings before income taxes 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized initially at fair value when the liability is incurred 
under previous accounting rules  costs to exit or dispose of an activity were generally recognized at the date that the exit or disposal plan was committed to and communicated 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  to account for exit and disposal activities arising after that date 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our exit and disposal activities 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which became effective for us upon its issuance 
sfas no 
provides three transition options for companies that account for stock based compensation  such as stock options  under the intrinsic value method to convert to the fair value method 
sfas no 
also revised the prominence and character of the disclosures related to companies stock based compensation 
in complying with the new reporting requirements of sfas no 
 we elected to continue using the intrinsic value method to account for qualifying stock based compensation  as permitted by sfas no 
however  we have included the disclosures prescribed by sfas no 
within the consolidated financial statements 
during november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin generally requires a guarantor to recognize a liability for obligations arising from guarantees 
fin also requires new disclosures for guarantees meeting certain criteria outlined in that pronouncement 
the disclosure requirements of fin became effective for us at december  and were implemented as of that date 
the recognition and measurement provisions of fin became effective on january  and have been implemented for guarantees issued after that date 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies the accounting and reporting for derivative contracts  including hedges 
the amendments and clarifications under sfas no 
generally serve to codify the conclusions reached by the derivatives implementation group  to incorporate other fasb projects on financial instruments  and to clarify other implementation issues 
sfas no 
became effective prospectively for our derivative contracts entered into or modified after june  the implementation of sfas no 
had no material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
generally requires the recognition as liabilities in the balance sheet for obligations under financial instruments possessing both liability and equity characteristics  such as mandatorily redeemable instruments  obligations to repurchase equity shares by transferring assets and obligations to issue a variable number of shares 
sfas no 
became effective for us beginning july  at which time we had no instruments governed by the pronouncement to be incorporated into liabilities 
thus the implementation of sfas no 
had no material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revised pronouncement requires substantially more disclosures about pension and postretirement benefits  including information about plan assets  estimated prospective contribution levels  estimated prospective benefit payment levels and other items which the fasb believes will provide clarity to readers of the financial statements 
except for information regarding anticipated future benefit payments  for which the revision allows deferral  we have made the disclosures specified by sfas no 
 as revised 
pronouncements not yet implemented in december  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vies by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries 
a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the enterprise that has the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the vie 
we believe we have no interests in vies that will require disclosure or consolidation under fin  and therefore expect its implementation to have no significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
during december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was enacted in the us the act generally permits plan sponsors that provide retiree prescription drug benefits that are actuarially equivalent to the benefits of medicare part d to be eligible for a non taxable federal subsidy 
as permitted by fasb staff position no 
fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  we have elected to defer accounting for any effects of the act until december  we are evaluating the impact of the act  including the emergence of specific authoritative guidance regarding the accounting treatment afforded the provisions of the act  which could require us to change information previously reported 
although there are no other final pronouncements recently issued which we have not adopted and that we expect to impact reported financial information or disclosures  accounting promulgating bodies have a number of pending projects which may directly impact us 
we continue to evaluate the status of these projects and as these projects become final  we will provide disclosures regarding the likelihood and magnitude of their impact  if any

at december   after the effect of interest rate swaps  we had approximately million of variable rate debt obligations outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
a hypothetical change of basis points in the interest rate for these borrowings  assuming constant variable rate debt levels  would have changed interest expense by approximately million for we employ a foreign currency hedging strategy to minimize potential losses in earnings or cash flows from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 
these strategies also minimize potential gains from favorable exchange rate movements 
foreign currency exposures arise from transactions  including firm commitments and anticipated transactions  denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency and from foreign denominated revenues and profits translated back into us dollars 
based on a sensitivity analysis at december   a adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates could impact our results of operations by million
