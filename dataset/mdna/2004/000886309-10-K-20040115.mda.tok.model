item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations marketplace conditions our operating results during fiscal  and were adversely affected by the downturn in spending for communications equipment 
although our quarterly revenues began to stabilize somewhat during fiscal  spending on communications equipment remains at low levels compared to pre levels 
the reasons for this lower level of spending include general economic conditions resulting in reduced end user demand for communications services  excess capacity within our customers communication networks  the absence of communications network buildouts by new competitive entrants in the service provider market and a related decline in competitive response spending by incumbent service providers 
when the downturn in communications equipment spending first became evident in fiscal  we began to implement restructuring plans to reduce operating expenses and capital spending and to narrow the focus of our business 
as it became evident in fiscal that our industry was experiencing an even more pronounced and prolonged economic downturn  we took additional measures to align our cost structure with lower revenues and narrow the focus of our business 
our actions to date have included the sale or closure of non strategic product lines  significant reductions in discretionary spending  the disposition of surplus equipment  consolidation of facilities  and substantial reductions in our workforce 
despite these restructuring actions  we may be unable to meet expected revenue levels in any particular quarter  in which case our operating results could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to further reduce our expenses in time to counteract such a decline in revenues 
we continue to be dependent on telecommunications service providers for the majority of our revenues  with the four major us incumbent local exchange carriers verizon  sbc  bellsouth and qwest accounting for approximately  and of our revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  our top ten customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
as the prolonged downturn in the communications service industry continues  we expect some consolidation among our customers in order for them to increase market share  diversify product portfolios and or achieve greater economies of scale and improve levels of profitability 
this activity is likely to have an impact on our results of operations during the time the consolidating companies focus on integrating their operations and choose their equipment vendors 
there can be no assurance that we will be a supplier to the surviving service provider 
for example  during fiscal  at t broadband  which was a customer of our ip cable products  was acquired by comcast corporation  and comcast informed us that we have not been approved as a continuing supplier of certain ip cable products 
in addition to the consolidation we expect from our customers  we expect several forms of structural change in the communications equipment industry 
competition among equipment vendors remains extremely intense 
these vendors including us are competing for business from relatively few  and very large  communication service providers who continue to exert pricing pressure on their vendors 
accordingly  we expect to see continued consolidation among our competitors or more strategic alliances among them to obtain greater economies of scale 
finally  we expect continuing product line rationalization as companies divest unprofitable product lines in an effort to focus on profitable business opportunities 
we plan to acquire additional product lines or businesses that are complimentary to our communications infrastructure business 
we intend to pursue acquisition opportunities that will enable us to expand our core business of supplying communications infrastructure products and services to communications service providers  as well as opportunities that will bolster our position as a supplier to private  or enterprise  network customers 
we expect to fund these potential acquisitions with all or a portion of the net proceeds of our million convertible note offering completed in june  with the issuance of shares of common or preferred stock or through some combination of cash and stock 
we may also divest non strategic product lines as we focus on growing our business profitably 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sell our broadaccess product line 
this product line accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal this transaction is expected to close by march  on february   the federal communications commission fcc adopted rules under the us telecommunications act of concerning the obligation of the established telecommunication service providers to share their networks with competitors  a practice known as unbundling 
the fcc essentially retained the existing unbundling obligations of the carriers with respect to their historic copper based network infrastructure  and ruled not to require the unbundling of certain network elements in their next generation hybrid and fiber networks 
in august  the fcc issued its final rules on unbundling obligations 
it is too early to predict what effect these rules will have on capital spending by our customers 
portions of these rules have already been subjected to legal challenges by various constituents within the telecommunications industry  and additional legal challenges are likely 
we do not anticipate that these rules will result in increased capital spending by the incumbent carriers or new competitors in the near term 
our ability to grow our business is dependent on our ability to effectively compete with our current products and services  our ability to develop and introduce new products  and on the growth of the communications equipment and services market 
the communications equipment industry is highly competitive 
growth in the market for broadband communications products and services depends on a number of factors  including the availability of capital to communications service providers  the amount of capital expenditures by communications service providers  new regulatory and legal requirements and end user demands for internet  data  video  voice and other communications services 
our revenues have declined dramatically over the last three fiscal years  with indications of stability appearing during fiscal we cannot predict whether this stability will remain  or when growth will occur 
prior to the downturn of fiscal  our results of operations had been subject to seasonal factors  with stronger demand for our products during our fourth fiscal quarter ending october primarily as a result of customer budget cycles and our fiscal year end incentives and weaker demand for our products during our first fiscal quarter ending january primarily as a result of the number of holidays in late november  december and early january  the development of annual capital budgets by our customers during that period  and a general industry slowdown during that period 
there can be no assurance that these historical seasonal trends will return 
a more detailed description of the risks to our business related to seasonality  along with other risk factors associated with our business  can be found in the section captioned risk factors at item of this annual report on form k

operating segment net sales net sales net sales broadband infrastructure and access integrated solutions total net sales fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales were million and  million for fiscal and  respectively  which was a decrease 
international net sales were and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  net sales of broadband infrastructure and access products declined by compared to fiscal net sales in the broadband infrastructure and access product lines decreased primarily as a result of lower volumes of products sold due to reductions in communications service provider capital budgets  as well as the lack of new network build outs or significant expansions of existing networks 
in addition  sales of our ip cable product line decreased due to a lower level of spending by our customers in general and particularly as a result of comcast corporation s acquisition of at t broadband  which previously was a significant customer for our ip cable products 
comcast has informed us that we have not been approved as a continuing supplier of cable modem termination systems  which we previously supplied to at t broadband  and has significantly reduced its purchases of our cable telephony products 
our wireline product line continues to face strong competition  which is continuing to put pressure on our market share positions and price levels for these products 
in response  we intend to aggressively defend our current market share by delivering high quality products and superior customer service and have taken steps to lower our production and engineering costs for these products 
net sales of our integrated solutions products declined by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in this segment is a result of continued reductions in our customers capital spending budgets as well as our decision not to bid on low margin systems integration projects 
the decrease in sales was tempered by a broadening of the historic customer base for our systems integration services  which has predominately been the major us incumbent local exchange carriers  to include wireless carriers and long distance service providers 
we anticipate that future revenue in our integrated solutions segment will be subject to increased variability  because we intend to focus our software sales efforts on major accounts  which typically have longer sales cycles for large scale software installations 
international sales increased as a percentage of sales in fiscal to from in fiscal this increase is due to a combination of more pronounced capital spending reductions by communication service providers in the united states than in other regions and two large contract wins in europe for our software and ip cable products 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales were  million and  million for fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a decrease 
international net sales comprised and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in net sales was largely attributable to lower volumes of products sold due to significant reductions in communication service provider capital budgets  as well as the lack of new network build outs or significant expansions of existing networks 
the decline was most pronounced for our broadband connectivity products  but occurred across all product lines with the exception of our ip cable products  which had increased sales over the prior year 
sales of our software products also declined  which we believe was in part due to the fact that these products had been targeted for the competitive local exchange carrier market  a segment which has been severely affected by a lack of capital resources  causing many of these companies to cease operations 
in response  during fiscal  we repositioned our software products to add applications for next generation wireless providers  enterprises and media and content providers  which we believe will present broader and higher growth opportunities 
we believe this target market transition contributed to the year over year decline in sales 
the sales decline was also due to the absence of sales from product lines we divested in fiscal and sales from divested product lines were million  and million in fiscal and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for a further breakdown of divested net sales by segment 
gross profit fiscal vs 
fiscal gross profit percentages were and  respectively  during fiscal and the increase in gross profit percentage was due to a more favorable sales mix toward higher margin connectivity products  our decision not to bid on low margin systems integration projects and a reduction in our fixed costs of sales as a result of our restructuring activities 
in addition  cost of sales for fiscal included million of other disposal charges for inventory write offs related to divested product lines 
in addition to a more favorable sales mix  we also benefited from production efficiencies and reduced production costs resulting from more favorable supplier pricing and the outsourcing of portions of our manufacturing operations 
we anticipate that our future gross profit percentage will vary based on many factors  including sales mix  competitive pricing  timing of new product introductions  timing of customer acceptance and collectibility of large scale sales transactions and manufacturing volume 
fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal and  gross profit percentages were and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume without a corresponding reduction in fixed factory expenses  and a shift in sales mix to lower margin products and services 
also  in fiscal and  million and million of other disposal charges for inventory write offs and other costs to exit certain sales contracts were included in cost of product sold  respectively 
operating expenses fiscal vs 
fiscal total operating expenses for fiscal and were million and  million  respectively 
included in these operating expenses were restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  and impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
although the largest factor in the decrease in operating expenses was the reduction in the amount of our restructuring and impairment charges  our operating expenses also declined due to the ongoing cost savings from our restructuring efforts 
research and development research and development expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  which represents a decrease of 
the decrease was largely due to the divestiture or discontinuance of certain product lines in fiscal as well as our ongoing cost containment efforts 
we believe that  given the rapidly changing technological and competitive environment in the communications equipment industry  continued commitment to product development efforts will be required for us to remain competitive 
accordingly  we intend to continue to allocate substantial resources  as a percentage of net sales  to product development in each of our operating segments 
selling and administration selling and administration expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was largely due to the effect of our workforce reductions and lower occupancy costs resulting from the consolidation of facilities 
occupancy costs were also lower as a result of the lower carrying value of certain facilities  due to the restructuring charges we incurred in fiscal impairment charges impairment charges represent a write down of the carrying value of long lived assets principally goodwill and fixed assets to their estimated fair market value 
these charges declined substantially in fiscal compared to fiscal million compared to million 
the fiscal impairment charges consisted solely of property and equipment impairments  which impacted both the broadband infrastructure and access and integrated solutions segments  and were caused by our plan to dispose of excess equipment 
the fair market value of this equipment was determined using external sources  primarily proceeds received from previous equipment sales or estimates of discounted cash flows 
the fiscal impairment charges related to the write down of goodwill and fixed assets 
the total goodwill write down was million  of which million related to our decision to exit the optical components product line  with the remainder resulting from our annual goodwill impairment analysis of our continuing businesses 
the total fixed asset impairment charge was million  of which million related to our decision to sell our glenrothes  scotland manufacturing facility 
the remaining charges are primarily related to our decision to exit the optical components and certain other product lines 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for a further discussion of our impairment charges 
restructuring charges restructuring charges represent the direct costs of exiting certain product lines  consolidating facilities and downsizing our business 
our restructuring charges also declined significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal million compared to million 
the fiscal restructuring charges consisted of million of employee severance for workforce reductions and million of facility consolidation charges 
the employee terminations affected both the broadband infrastructure and access and integrated solutions segments 
during fiscal  we reduced our workforce by approximately  employees of our total workforce  which included approximately  employees impacted by reductions in force 
the fiscal restructuring charges consisted principally of million related to the consolidation of facilities  million for employee severance costs related to our workforce reduction  and million for in process research and development costs relating to our decision to purchase the interest of our joint venture partner in three technology development partnerships 
of the of facilities consolidation costs  million related to our decision to extend the lease on our headquarters facility 
this charge represented the reduction in fair market value of the facility below the value we had guaranteed to the lessor 
see liquidity and capital resources finance related transactions below  for a further discussion of our headquarters lease 
the balance of the facilities consolidation costs related to lease termination costs for excess facilities  as we deactivated approximately million square feet of our total space during fiscal the employee severance costs related to our workforce reduction of approximately  employees in fiscal of our total workforce  which included approximately  employees impacted by reductions in force 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for a further discussion of our restructuring charges 
fiscal vs 
fiscal total operating expenses for fiscal and were  million and  million  representing and of net sales  respectively 
included in these operating expenses were restructuring charges of million and million  other disposal charges reversals of million and million and impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition to the lower aggregate amount of impairment  restructuring and other disposal charges in fiscal  our operating expenses were lower primarily due to the ongoing cost savings from our restructuring efforts as well as the divestiture of certain product lines 
research and development research and development expenses were million for fiscal  representing a decrease from million for fiscal this decrease reflected our efforts to control expenses 
selling and administration selling and administration expenses were million for fiscal  representing a decrease of from million for fiscal this decrease reflects the benefits realized from our restructuring efforts 
in addition  selling and administration expenses decreased million from due to the divestiture or discontinuance of certain product lines in fiscal also included in the fiscal and amounts were million and million  respectively  in selling and administration expenses reversals incurred to complete certain non cancelable sales contracts and contract cancellation payments to customers as a result of our decision to exit certain product lines 
goodwill amortization in accordance with sfas no 
 we did not record goodwill amortization in fiscal we recorded million of goodwill amortization expense in fiscal impairment charges impairment charges decreased significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal million compared to million 
the fiscal charges were higher because of our substantial divestiture activity in that year in response to the onset of the telecommunications industry downturn 
of the total million of impairment charges in fiscal  million related to the write down of goodwill and million related to the write down of fixed assets 
the goodwill impairment charge was recognized as a result of our decision to exit non strategic product lines 
the fixed asset impairment charge of million resulted from the consolidation of unproductive and duplicative facilities as well as the exit from non strategic product lines 
restructuring charges restructuring charges were not significantly different in fiscal than in fiscal million compared to million 
the million of restructuring charges in fiscal related to our actions to downsize our business in response to declining sales 
these charges consisted principally of million for employee severance costs related to our workforce reduction  and million of facilities consolidation costs  which consisted principally of lease termination costs 
during fiscal  we reduced our workforce by approximately  employees of the total workforce  which included approximately  employees impacted by reductions in force 
we also deactivated approximately million square feet of excess facilities of our total space during fiscal in addition  we incurred million of acquisition and integration costs and other restructuring charges in fiscal  principally related to our acquisitions of commtech corporation and france electronique in early fiscal other income expense  net other income expense  net includes net interest income expense  gain or loss on the write down  sale or conversion of our investments  gain or loss on the sale or shutdown of certain product lines and other items 
each of these items is discussed below 
interest the net interest income expense category represents net interest on cash and cash equivalents as well as debt 
interest income was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
interest income decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to lower restricted cash balances  reduced interest bearing customer receivables and lower yields on our short term investments 
our interest income increased during fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher average cash balances maintained during fiscal  partially offset by lower yields on our short term investments 
interest expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
interest expense declined in fiscal due to the absence of charges relating to our former accounts receivable securitization facility and a general decline in interest rates  which were partially offset by million of additional interest expense relating to the convertible notes we issued in june see liquidity and capital resources below for a discussion of cash and debt levels 
write down  sale or conversion of investments fiscal during fiscal  we sold common stock of certain companies in our portfolio and two investments in non publicly traded securities for an aggregate gain of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion of our investment activity 
fiscal during fiscal  we sold common stock of certain companies in our investment portfolio and settled related hedging arrangements for a gain of million 
these gains were offset by non cash write downs in the amount of million for our marketable securities investments  and million for our non marketable securities 
fiscal during fiscal  we sold common stock of certain companies in our portfolio and settled related hedging arrangements for a net gain of million 
this gain was more than offset by a non cash loss of million we recognized for the decline in the market value of our marketable and non marketable securities 
sale or shutdown of product lines fiscal no significant product lines were divested or discontinued during fiscal fiscal during fiscal  we sold non strategic product lines in broadcast tv video routing and optical components 
we also closed down our avidia multiplexer and our optical laser product lines and halted further development of the us version of our ian product line 
these products did not meet our growth  profitability and market leadership criteria 
the sales of these assets generated approximately million in cash  net of cash disposed  in fiscal included in these sales and closures were domestic operations in california  minnesota and texas  as well as international operations in australia and sweden 
these product lines generated annual net sales of million and million and operating losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
as a result of these actions  we recorded total losses on sales or shutdowns of approximately million in fiscal fiscal during fiscal  we sold non strategic product lines in cable broadcast tv transmission  broadband wireless transmission  enterprise access products  wireless components  optical components and enhanced services software 
we also closed down our cellworx transport product line in fiscal the sales of these assets generated approximately million in cash  net of cash disposed  in fiscal included in these sales were domestic operations in california  connecticut  minnesota  oregon and pennsylvania  as well as international operations in argentina  austria  denmark and finland 
these product lines generated annual net sales of million and operating losses of million in fiscal as a result of these actions  we recorded total losses on sales or shutdowns of approximately million in fiscal patent infringement settlement during fiscal  we recognized a million gain from the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit we brought against a competitor 
fixed assets in connection with our efforts to streamline and focus our operations to reduce costs  we sold excess equipment in fiscal  and as a result of these sales  we recognized a million  million and million loss in fiscal  and  respectively 
other  net other  net primarily represents the gain or loss on foreign exchange transactions  loss on sale leaseback transactions and our share of losses in equity method investments 
other net income expense was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
income taxes fiscal vs 
fiscal vs 
fiscal note to the consolidated financial statements describes the items which have impacted our effective income tax rate for fiscal  and significant items include the deductibility of impairment charges and expiration of foreign tax credit carryovers 
in addition  as a result of our cumulative losses in fiscal and and the full utilization of our loss carryback potential  we concluded during the third quarter of fiscal that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was appropriate 
since the third quarter of fiscal  we have continued to provide a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit totaling million 
this benefit is primarily attributable to the reversal of accrued income tax liabilities resulting from the finalization of federal  state and foreign income tax examinations 
net loss net loss was million or per diluted share for fiscal  compared to net loss of  million or per diluted share for fiscal net loss was  million or per diluted share for fiscal segment disclosures broadband infrastructure and access segment detailed information regarding our broadband infrastructure and access segment is provided in the following table dollars in millions for the years ended october  external sales operating loss depreciation and amortization capital expenditures at october  assets operating loss excludes certain charges and expenses not allocated to the segments as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
broadband infrastructure and access sales decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to decreased demand for broadband connectivity systems and components  an overall weakness in the telecommunications equipment industry and product lines sold or shutdown in fiscal and in fiscal  economic and industry weakness also led to a sales decrease of  million  or  compared to fiscal during fiscal  operating loss for the broadband infrastructure and access segment decreased by to million compared to million in fiscal this improvement is primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of our restructuring and impairment charges  the ongoing cost savings from our restructuring efforts and the divestiture of certain product lines 
while sales decreased  margins increased due to a shift in product sales mix to higher margin products 
we also benefited from production efficiencies and related production cost declines resulting from our decision to outsource portions of our manufacturing operations 
during fiscal  operating loss increased million from fiscal due to a decrease in sales volume and an unfavorable shift in product sales mix 
during fiscal  depreciation and amortization decreased million compared to fiscal this decrease is the result of our restructuring efforts in fiscal and fiscal  which led to a reduction in our property  plant and equipment balances 
capital expenditures decreased million and million  in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal and was a result of our company wide efforts to limit capital expenditures in light of the industry downturn 
integrated solutions segment detailed information regarding our integrated solutions segment is provided in the following table dollars in millions for the years ended october  external sales operating loss depreciation and amortization capital expenditures at october  assets operating loss excludes certain charges and expenses not allocated to the segments as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
integrated solutions sales decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal by million  or 
during fiscal and  many of our customers reduced their spending budgets as well as focused on improving their existing infrastructure rather than building new capacity 
in addition  we shifted the market focus for our software products away from competitive local exchange carriers and into next generation service providers  enterprises and media and content providers 
this transition led to a decline in software sales in fiscal as well as fiscal during fiscal  operating loss for the integrated solutions segment decreased million compared to fiscal fiscal operating loss decreased by million compared to fiscal the decrease in operating loss for both years was primarily due to cost savings achieved as a result of our restructuring initiatives in fiscal   and depreciation and amortization decreased by million in fiscal and decreased by million in fiscal the fiscal and decrease is the result of our restructuring efforts  which reduced the amount of property plant and equipment 
capital expenditures decreased million  or  and million  or  in fiscal and  respectively 
these decreases were a result of our company wide efforts to limit capital expenditures in light of the industry downturn 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our most critical accounting policies because these policies are impacted significantly by estimates we make 
we base our estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of first in  first out cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with current or committed inventory levels 
our reserve requirements generally increase as our projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods for previously sold equipment 
we have experienced significant changes in required reserves in recent periods due primarily to adverse market conditions 
it is possible that significant increases in inventory reserves may be required in the future if there is a further decline in market conditions 
alternatively  if we are able to sell previously reserved inventory  we may find it necessary to reverse a portion of the reserves 
changes in inventory reserves are recorded as a component of cost of sales 
as of october  and  we had and million  respectively  reserved against our inventories  which represents and  respectively  of total inventory on hand 
long lived assets goodwill prior to fiscal  we evaluated property and equipment and identifiable intangibles for potential impairment in compliance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows  including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  grouping of assets  discount rate and terminal growth rates 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
write downs of long lived assets are recorded as impairment charges and are a component of operating expenses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for details on our impairment charges 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets during we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually or at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss  which is a component of operating expenses 
fair value of the reporting units was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  value is dependent on the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership 
the income approach requires significant estimates about future cash flows and discount rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for information about the results of the goodwill impairment tests 
at october  and  million and million  respectively  of goodwill remained on our books  related solely to our integrated solutions segment 
restructuring accrual during fiscal and  we recorded significant restructuring charges representing the direct costs of exiting certain product lines or businesses and the costs of downsizing our business 
prior to january   such charges were established in accordance with eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
and record restructuring charges based on that standard see recently issued accounting pronouncements for a discussion of this standard 
restructuring charges represent our best estimate at the date the charges were taken 
significant judgment is required in estimating the costs of disposing of excess facilities  both leased and owned facilities 
for example  in estimating the restructuring costs for excess facilities  we make certain assumptions with respect to when a facility will be subleased or sold  the amount of sublease income or the sales price  and the amount of any fees or other transaction costs to be incurred 
adjustments for changes in assumptions are recorded as a component of operating expenses in the period they become known 
changes in assumptions could have a material effect on our restructuring accrual as well as our consolidated results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales is primarily recognized at the time of delivery and acceptance  and after consideration of all the terms and conditions of the customer contract 
revenue from services consists of fees for systems requirements  system design and analysis  customization and installation services  ongoing system management  system enhancements  service bureau processing  facilities management and maintenance 
services revenue is recognized as the services are performed  primarily on a time and materials basis and to a lesser extent on a fixed fee basis over the term of the services provided 
revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  generally one year 
revenue from the licensing of software rights is recognized at the time of delivery of the software to the customer  provided that we have no remaining service obligations  collectibility is reasonably assured and the fees are fixed and determinable 
where there are service obligations that are essential to the functionality of the software installed  license fees are recorded over the term of the initial customization period 
the assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether or not revenue should be recognized in the current market environment 
as part of the revenue recognition process  we determine whether trade and notes receivable are reasonably assured of collection based on various factors  including an evaluation of whether there has been deterioration in the credit quality of our customers  which could result in us being unable to collect or sell the receivables 
in situations where it is unclear as to whether we will be able to sell or collect the receivable  revenue and related costs are deferred 
costs are recognized when it has been determined that the collection of the receivable is unlikely 
we record provisions against our gross revenue for estimated product returns and allowances in the period when the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on factors that include  but are not limited to  historical sales returns  analyses of credit memo activities  current economic trends and changes in our customers demand 
should our actual product returns and allowances exceed our estimates  additional reductions to our revenue would result 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables and notes receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
our reserves are also based on amounts determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but are not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
significant increases in reserves have been recorded in recent periods and may occur in the future due to deteriorating market conditions 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of our receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provided more allowances than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on our actual collection experience 
changes in the allowance are recorded as a component of operating expenses 
as of october  and  we had million and million  respectively  reserved against our accounts receivable  which represents and  respectively  of total accounts receivable 
warranty we provide reserves for the estimated cost of warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our warranty policy or applicable contractual warranty  our historical experience of known product failure rates  and use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from our estimates  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
changes in warranty reserves are recorded as a component of cost of sales 
as of october  and  we reserved and million  respectively  related to future estimated warranty costs 
income taxes and deferred taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between taxable income on our income tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principles 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would not realize these assets 
our decision was based on the cumulative losses we had incurred to that point as well as the full utilization of our loss carryback potential 
from the third quarter of fiscal to date  we have maintained our policy of providing a full valuation allowance against all future tax benefits produced by our operating results 
we expect to continue to provide a full allowance on any future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize these assets 
as of october  and  our deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance were million and million  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for a further discussion of the accounting treatment for income taxes 
litigation reserves as of october  and  we had recorded approximately million and million  in loss reserves for pending litigation 
this reserve was based on the application of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss is capable of reasonable estimation 
as explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  and at part i  item of this form k legal proceedings  we are a party to numerous lawsuits  proceedings and claims 
litigation by its nature is uncertain and the determination of whether any particular case involves a probable loss or the amount thereof requires the exercise of considerable judgment  which is applied as of a certain date 
accordingly  if our assumptions or conclusions are incorrect  the amount of the loss incurred could exceed the amount we have reserved  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or if we determine to change our strategy with respect to any particular matter 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas sfas primarily addresses significant issues relating to the implementation of sfas and develops a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of  whether primarily held  used or newly acquired 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this standard in first quarter of fiscal year in fiscal  we wrote down million of assets by applying sfas prior to adopting this standard  we wrote down long lived assets  excluding goodwill  by and million in fiscal and  respectively  by applying sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
superseded emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf no 
relates to when an entity can recognize a liability related to exit or disposal costs 
sfas no 
requires that a liability be recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred 
eitf no 
allowed a liability related to an exit or disposal activity to be recognized on the date an entity commits to an exit plan 
we adopted this standard on january   which was the standard s effective date 
adoption of the standard did not materially impact our consolidated financial results or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others  which requires a guarantor to recognize and measure certain types of guarantees at fair value 
in addition  fin requires the guarantor to make new disclosures for these guarantees and other types of guarantees that are not subject to the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements with interim or annual periods ended after december   while the recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we adopted the initial recognition and measurement provision as well as the disclosure provision of fin during the first quarter of fiscal year the initial recognition and measurement provisions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the provisions of sfas no 
amend sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
also expands the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
by requiring more detailed disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements 
the transition provisions of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial results  as we do not plan to adopt the fair value based accounting provisions of sfas no 
 which is commonly referred to as expensing of stock options 
the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for interim periods beginning after december  accordingly  we adopted the disclosure provisions of this standard during the second quarter of fiscal year in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which requires companies to consolidate certain types of variable interest entities 
a variable interest entity is an entity that has inadequate invested equity at risk to meet expected future losses  or whose holders of the equity investments lack any of the following three characteristics i the ability to make our decisions about the entity s activities  ii the obligation to absorb the entity s losses if they occur  or iii the right to receive the entity s future returns if they occur 
fin is applicable immediately for variable interest entities created after january  for variable interest entities created before february   the provisions of the interpretation are effective for financial statements issued for the first period ending after december   or march   depending on the nature of the variable interest entity 
fin is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash cash and cash equivalents  primarily short term investments in commercial paper with maturities of less than days had a balance of million at october   which is an increase of million compared to october  in addition  we held million of us government securities at october   compared to none at october  the major sources of cash during fiscal were million in income tax refunds and the net proceeds of million from our convertible note offering completed on june  these cash inflows were partially offset by million of net property  plant and equipment additions 
as of october   we had restricted cash of million compared to million of restricted cash as of october   a decrease of million 
our restricted cash decreased by million as a result of our purchase five properties subject to synthetic operating leases and million to pay a guarantee of a customer note receivable 
restricted cash represents cash pledged to various financial institutions to secure certain of our obligations  and is not available to us for working capital 
the majority of our restricted cash represents collateral for letters of credit and lease obligations 
restricted cash is expected to become available to us upon satisfaction of the obligations pursuant to which the letters of credit or guarantees were issued 
we are entitled to the interest earnings on our restricted cash balances 
cash and cash equivalents were million as of october   which was a decrease of million compared to october  the major uses of cash during fiscal were a million net increase in restricted cash which reduced the balance in cash and cash equivalents  million in property  plant and equipment additions  and million used to pay current liabilities as well as net cash losses from operations 
these cash outflows were partially offset by million provided from income tax refunds  and million from more effective working capital management such as account receivable collections  lower inventory requirements and lower prepaid assets 
in addition  we received million on the sale of available for sale securities during fiscal finance related transactions on june   we issued million of convertible unsecured subordinated notes in two separate transactions pursuant to rule a under the securities act of this issuance was made through an initial offering of million of convertible notes on may   and the subsequent exercise in full by the underwriters of such offering of their option to purchase an additional million of convertible notes 
the net proceeds to us from this offering were million after underwriting discounts of million and the net payment for the purchased call options and warrant transactions described below 
in the first transaction  we issued million of fixed rate convertible unsecured subordinated notes that mature on june  in the second transaction  we issued million of convertible unsecured subordinated notes that have a variable interest rate and mature on june  the interest rate for the variable rate notes is equal to month libor plus 
the interest rate for the variable rate notes will be reset on each semi annual interest payment date  which are june and december of each year beginning on december   for both the fixed and variable rate notes 
the initial interest rate on the variable note is for the period ending december  the holders of both the fixed and variable rate notes may convert all or some of their notes into shares of our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of per share 
we may not redeem the fixed rate notes prior to their maturity date 
we may redeem any or all of the variable rate notes at any time on or after june concurrent with the issuance of the fixed and variable rate notes  we purchased five and ten year call options on our common stock to reduce the potential dilution from conversion of the notes 
under the terms of these call options  which become exercisable upon conversion of the notes  we have the right to purchase from the counterparty at a purchase price of per share the aggregate number of shares that we are obligated to issue upon conversion of the fixed and variable notes  which is a maximum of million shares 
we also have the option to settle the call options with the counterparty through a net a share settlement or cash settlements  either of which would be based on the extent to which the then current market price of our common stock exceeds per share 
the total cost of all the call options was million  which is recorded in shareowners investment 
the cost of the call options was partially offset by the sale of warrants to acquire shares of our common stock with terms of five and ten years to the same counterparty with whom we entered into the call options 
the warrants are exercisable for an aggregate of million shares at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants become exercisable upon conversion of the notes  and may be settled  at our option  either through a net share settlement or a net cash settlement  either of which would be based on the extent which the then current market price of our common stock exceeds per share 
the gross proceeds from the sale of the warrants were million  which was recognized in shareowners investment 
the call options and the warrants are subject to early expiration upon conversion of the notes 
the net effect of the call options and the warrants is to either reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes if we elect net share settlement or to increase the net cash proceeds of the offering if we elect net cash settlement if the notes are converted at a time when the current market price of our common stock is greater than per share 
we plan to use the cash proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes and strategic opportunities  including financing for possible acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or products 
we were party to an operating lease agreement related to our headquarters facility in eden prairie  minnesota 
this lease was set to expire in october of fiscal this operating lease  which is sometimes referred to as a synthetic lease  contained a minimum residual value guarantee at the end of the lease term  and also gave us a purchase option at the end of the lease term 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we purchased this property for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the entire purchase price was paid out of restricted cash 
in addition  during fiscal  we purchased a total of four other properties that we leased under synthetic leases 
two properties were purchased for million and the remaining two were purchased for million 
all of the properties were purchased using restricted cash previously pledged to secure the lease obligations 
the two properties that were purchased for million were recorded at their fair market value of million  which resulted in a million impairment charge and a million reduction in our restructuring accrual as we previously recognized this loss in a prior fiscal year 
these two properties are currently classified as assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet because we intend to sell them within one year from the date of purchase 
the remaining two properties that were purchased for million were immediately sold for total proceeds of million  which was available to us as unrestricted cash 
the difference between the purchase price for these two properties of million and the sale price of million was previously included in our restructuring accrual 
capital expenditure and investment commitments as of october   we had commitments both cancelable and non cancelable for capital expenditures related to the ongoing operation of our business of approximately million 
these commitments primarily reflect future equipment purchases as well as improvements to existing buildings and facilities 
the commitments are estimated to be paid by the end of fiscal we intend to fund these expenditures from cash on hand 
vendor financing we have worked with customers and third party financiers to find a means of financing projects by negotiating financing arrangements 
as of october   and  we had commitments to extend credit of million  million and million for such arrangements  respectively 
the total amount drawn and outstanding under the commitments was approximately million  million and million  respectively  as of october   and the commitments to extend credit are conditional agreements generally having fixed expiration or termination dates and specific interest rates  conditions and purposes 
these commitments may expire without being drawn 
we regularly review all outstanding commitments  and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the overall risk for possible credit losses 
at october   we have recorded approximately million in loss reserves in the event of non performance related to these financing arrangements 
in connection with the sale of a participation interest in a customer note receivable for million  we guaranteed the payment obligation of the customer to the purchaser of the participation interest 
during fiscal  the underlying customer defaulted on the note receivable 
therefore  we were required to pay the purchaser of the participation interest million  which was the outstanding principal and interest on the note receivable at the time the customer defaulted 
of the million payment  we used million from our restricted cash that was previously pledged to secure our guarantee with the remainder being paid from unrestricted cash 
this note receivable was fully reserved for as part our allowance for doubtful accounts 
working capital and liquidity outlook our main source of liquidity continues to be our unrestricted cash on hand 
we believe that our current unrestricted cash on hand should be adequate to fund our working capital requirements  planned capital expenditures and restructuring costs through fiscal if we are able to maintain break even or positive cash flow from operations  our existing cash should be adequate to fund such expenditures for several years 
we believe that our entire restructuring accrual of million as of october   will have to be paid from our unrestricted cash shown as cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet as follows million for employee severance will be paid in fiscal  million for facilities consolidation costs  which relate principally to excess leased facilities  will be paid in fiscal  and the remainder of million  which also relates to excess leased facilities  will be paid over the respective lease terms ending through we also believe that our unrestricted cash on hand will also enable us to pursue strategic opportunities  including possible product line or business acquisitions 
however  if the cost of one or more acquisition opportunities exceeds our existing capital resources  additional sources of capital may be required 
we do not currently have any committed lines of credit or other available credit facilities  and it is uncertain whether such facilities could be obtained in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
any plan to raise additional capital may involve an equity based or equity linked financing  such as another issuance of convertible debt or the issuance of common stock or preferred stock  which would be dilutive to existing shareholders 
following the completion of our convertible note financing transaction in fiscal  we have approximately million shares of common stock available for issuance under our articles of incorporation after taking into account our share reserves for our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
accordingly  any plan to raise capital through the issuance of shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock may require an amendment to our articles of incorporation  which would require the approval of shareowners 
our proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareowners includes a proposal to increase our authorized shares of common stock by billion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in security prices  foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
market fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial condition adversely 
we  at times  reduce this risk through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for the purpose of speculation 
we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of issuing million of convertible unsecured subordinated notes on june   that have a variable interest rate 
the interest rate on these notes is equal to month libor plus 
the interest rate on these notes is reset semiannually on each interest payment date  which is june and december of each year until their maturity in fiscal assuming interest rates rise an additional  and  our annual interest expense would increase by million  million and million  respectively 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  we maintain an investment portfolio of available for sale equity securities of million 
the values recorded for these investments are subject to market price volatility 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when necessary 
we offer a non qualified k excess plan to allow certain executives to defer earnings in excess of the annual individual contribution and compensation limits on k plans imposed by the us internal revenue code 
under this plan  the salary deferrals and our matching contributions are not placed in a separate fund or trust account 
rather  the deferrals represent our unsecured general obligation to pay the balance owing to the executives upon termination of their employment 
in addition  the executives are able to elect to have their account balances indexed to a variety of diversified mutual funds stock  bond and balanced  as well as to our common stock 
accordingly  our outstanding deferred compensation obligation under this plan is subject to market risk 
as of october   our outstanding deferred compensation obligation related to the k excess plan was million  of which approximately million was indexed to adc common stock 
assuming a  or aggregate increase in the value of the investment alternatives to which the account balances may be indexed  our outstanding deferred compensation obligation would increase by million  million and million  respectively  and we would incur an expense of a like amount 
we also are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate the risk from these exposures  we have instituted a balance sheet hedging program 
the objective of this program is to protect our net monetary assets and liabilities in non functional currencies from fluctuations due to movements in foreign exchange rates 
the program operates in markets where hedging costs are beneficial 
we attempt to minimize exposure to currencies in which hedging instruments are unavailable or prohibitively expensive by managing our operating activities and net asset positions 
the majority of hedging instruments utilized are forward contracts with maturities of less than one year 
foreign exchange contracts reduce our overall exposure to exchange rate movements  since gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the underlying exposure 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for information about our foreign exchange hedging program
