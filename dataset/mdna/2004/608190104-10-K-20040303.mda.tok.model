compound average growth rates in units sold measured in square yards for all categories  except the vinyl and rubber category  for the period from through have met or exceeded the growth rate for both the gross domestic product of the united states and housing starts over the same period 
during this period  the compound average growth rate was for carpet and rugs  for ceramic tile  for vinyl and rubber and for hardwood 
laminate  which is a relatively new product  experienced a compound average growth rate of from through although beginning from a smaller base  the growth rates for hard floorcoverings may indicate increasing consumer preference for these products for certain applications 
in response to this increasing demand  the company has increased its distribution of hard surface products  including ceramic tile  vinyl  hardwood and laminate 
the acquisition of dal tile provided a unique opportunity to help the company achieve its strategic goal of becoming one of the world s leading floorcovering manufacturers and distributors

critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the company s consolidated statements of earnings during the reporting periods 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from these estimates 
the sec issued disclosure guidance for accounting policies that management believes are most critical 
the sec defines these critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and could represent critical accounting policies as defined by the sec 
the company discusses its significant accounting policies  including those that do not require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates  in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable and revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when goods are shipped and legal title passes to the customer 
the company provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo predominantly within the mohawk segment  which matches current costs with current revenues  and the first in  first out method fifo  which is used to value inventory within the dal tile segment 
inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage  which is a function of historical usage and anticipated future selling price  in order to evaluate obsolescence  excessive quantities  and expected sales below cost 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete  excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets based on management judgments and assumptions using estimated future cash flows 
these judgments and assumptions could materially change the value of the specified reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and  therefore  could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
additionally  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with the company s tax treatment of certain items  and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws  rules and regulations  each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner

impact of inflation inflation affects the company s manufacturing costs and operating expenses 
the carpet and tile industry has experienced inflation in the prices of raw materials and fuel related costs

seasonality the company is a calendar year end company and its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest 
the second  third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income 
these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floorcovering  which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season 
certain factors affecting the company s performance in addition to the other information provided in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of common stock 
if any of the events described in these risks were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the floorcovering industry is cyclical and prolonged declines in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the us floorcovering industry is highly dependent on residential and commercial construction activity  including new construction as well as remodeling which are cyclical in nature 
a prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the us construction industry has experienced significant downturns in the past  which have adversely affected suppliers to the industry 
the industry could experience similar downturns in the future  which could have a negative impact on the company s business 
the company faces intense competition in its industry  which could decrease demand for its products and could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 
the industry is highly competitive 
the company faces competition from a large number of manufacturers and independent distributors 
some of its competitors may be larger and have greater resources and access to capital 
maintaining the company s competitive position may require substantial investments in its product development efforts  manufacturing facilities  distribution network and sales and marketing activities 
competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for its products 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company 
a failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates  to complete acquisitions and to integrate successfully the acquired operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
as part of its business strategy  the company intends to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses 
although it regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities  it may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions  complete acquisitions  or profitably manage acquired businesses 
acquired operations may not achieve expected performance levels and may involve a number of special risks  including among others an inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and the diversion of management resources 
the company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the principal raw materials used in the company s manufacturing operations include nylon fiber and polypropylene resin  which are used exclusively in its carpet and rug business  talc  clay  nepheline syenite and various glazes  including frit ground glass  zircon and stains  which are used exclusively in its ceramic tile business and other materials 
the company has a single source supplier for all of its nepheline syenite requirements 
an extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the company s business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the company s operations  which could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the company may be unable to pass on to its customers increases in the costs of raw materials and energy  which could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 
the prices of raw materials and natural gas vary with market conditions 
although the company generally attempts to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials and natural gas to its customers  the company s ability to do so is  dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase  competitive pressures and market conditions for its products 
there have been in the past  and may be in the future  periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered 
during such periods of time  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s profitability 
the company has been  and in the future may be subject to claims and liabilities under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  which could be significant 
the company s operations are subject to various environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  and the use  storage  treatment and disposal of hazardous materials 
the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment  to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts 
the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations  including fines and penalties 
the nature of the company s operations  including the potential discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions  exposes the company to the risk of claims under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
the company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such claims 
changes in international trade laws and in the business  political and regulatory environment in mexico could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s monterrey  mexico manufacturing facility represents a significant portion of the company s total manufacturing capacity for ceramic tile 
accordingly  an event that has a material adverse impact on the company s mexican operations could have a material adverse effect on the tile operations as a whole 
the business  regulatory and political environments in mexico differ from those in the united states  and the company s mexican operations are exposed to legal  currency  tax  political  and economic risks  specific to mexico 
the company could face increased competition as a result of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and the north american free trade agreement nafta 
the company is uncertain what effect reduced import duties under gatt may have on its operations  although these reduced rates may stimulate additional competition from manufacturers that export ceramic tile to the united states 
although nafta lowers the tariffs imposed on the company s ceramic tile manufactured in mexico and sold in the united states and will eliminate such tariffs entirely on january   it may also stimulate competition in the united states and canada from manufacturers located in mexico 
forward looking information certain of the statements in this annual report on form k  particularly anticipating of future performance  business prospects  growth and operating strategies  proposed acquisitions  and similar matters  and those that include the words believes  anticipates  forecast  estimates or similar expressions constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
for those statements  mohawk claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements will be accurate because they are based on many assumptions  which involve risks and uncertainties 
the following important factors could cause future results to differ changes in industry conditions  competition  raw material prices  timing and level of capital expenditures  integration of acquisitions  introduction of new products  rationalization of operations  and other risks identified in mohawk s sec reports and public announcements
