revenue sources fiscal years ended eight months ended fiscal years ended january  december  december  december  april  april  in millions naco meetings fees international company owned meeting fees product sales franchise royalties other total after our acquisition by artal luxembourg in  we reorganized our management and strengthened our strategic focus 
since  our revenues have increased as shown in the chart above 
our operating income margin has grown from in fiscal to in fiscal the increases are principally a result of increased naco classroom attendance 
as a result of our decision to re focus our meetings exclusively on our group education approach and to introduce into naco our points based program developed in the united kingdom and our liberty loyalty meeting fee pricing strategy developed in france  our naco classroom attendance  including the impact of our acquisitions  grew between fiscal and fiscal at a compound annual rate of 
including acquisitions of our franchises which were made over this period ww group and weighco and those in dallas  new mexico  north jersey  san diego and eastern north carolina  our attendance grew from million in to million in accelerated growth in continental europe 
in continental europe  we have accelerated growth by adapting our business model to local conditions  implementing more aggressive marketing programs tailored to the local markets and increasing the number of meetings ahead of anticipated demand 
between fiscal and fiscal  attendance in our continental european operations grew at a compound annual rate of 
increased product sales 
we have increased our product sales by from fiscal to fiscal as a result of our growing attendance  introducing new products and optimizing our product mix 
in our meetings  we have increased average product sales per attendance from to over the same period 
as shown in the chart below  our worldwide attendance including acquisitions of franchises in our company owned operations has grown by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal attendance in company owned operations fiscal years ended twelve months ended eight months ended fiscal years ended january  december  december  december  december  april  april  weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks in millions north america united kingdom continental europe other international total since the fiscal year ended december   we have acquired the franchised territories and certain business assets of five franchisees as outlined below acquisitions attendance fiscal years ended purchase price closing date january  december  in millions north jersey january  san diego july  eastern north carolina september  ww group march  dallas new mexico november  from date of acquisition to the end of the fiscal year 
less than million these acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  their results of operations have been included in our consolidated operating results since the dates of the completion of their respective acquisitions 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to inventories  investments  the impairment analysis for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the bases for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most significant judgments 
revenue recognition we earn revenue by conducting meetings  selling products and aids in our meetings and to our franchisees  collecting commissions from franchisees operating under the weight watchers name  collecting royalties related to licensing agreements  selling advertising space in and copies of our magazine 
we charge non refundable registration fees in exchange for an introductory information session and materials we provide to new members 
revenue from these registration fees is recognized when the service and products are provided  which is generally at the same time payment is received from the customer 
revenue from meeting fees  product sales  commissions and royalties is recognized when services are rendered  products are shipped to customers and title and risk of loss pass to the customer  and commissions and royalties are earned 
advertising revenue is recognized when ads are published 
revenue from magazine sales is recognized when the magazine is sent to the customer 
deferred revenue  consisting of prepaid lecture and magazine subscription revenue  is amortized into income over the period earned 
discounts to customers  including free registration offers  are recorded as a deduction from gross revenue in the period such revenue was recognized 
we grant refunds under limited circumstances and at aggregate amounts that historically have not been material 
because the period of payment generally approximates the period revenue was originally recognized  refunds are recorded as a reduction of revenue when paid 
goodwill and intangibles finite lived intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of three to years 
effective december   we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  but are required to review these assets for potential impairment 
we performed fair value impairment testing as of january  and december  on our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  which determine that the carrying amounts of these assets did not exceed their respective fair values and therefore  no impairment was evident 
we are required to perform this impairment testing at least annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such event  we would then be required to record a corresponding charge  which would impact earnings 
we continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions and believe that these assumptions  which included an estimate of future cash flows based upon the anticipated performance of the underlying business units  were appropriate 
hedging instruments we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies in order to reduce currency risk associated with fluctuating exchange rates 
these contracts have been used primarily to hedge payments arising from some of our foreign currency denominated obligations 
in addition  we enter into interest rate swaps to hedge a substantial portion of our variable rate debt 
we account for our hedging instruments under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that all derivative financial instruments be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities 
fair value adjustments for qualifying derivative instruments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and will be included in earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged item 
fair value adjustments for non qualifying derivative instruments are recorded in our results of operations

income taxes deferred income taxes result primarily from temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
if it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recognized 
we consider historic levels of income  estimates of future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a tax valuation allowance

the decline in gross margin from the prior year also contributed to the operating margin compression

our credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests 
our obligations under the remaining notes million at january  are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  including all indebtedness under the credit facility 
we or our affiliates  including entities related to artal luxembourg  may from time to time  depending on market conditions  purchase the notes in the open market or by other means 
in  both moody s and standard and poor s upgraded our credit ratings 
our credit ratings by moody s at december  for the credit facility and notes were ba and ba  respectively

on july   both standard poor s and moody s confirmed these aforementioned ratings 
in january  we entered into another refinancing to move a large portion of our debt from fixed term loans to revolver 
this provides us with a greater degree of flexibility and the ability to more efficiently manage cash 
under the refinancing  our term loans have been reduced from million to million and our revolver capacity has increased from million to million 
to complete the refinancing  we drew down million of the revolver 
in connection with this refinancing  we incurred expenses of approximately million in the first quarter of contractual obligations we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases primarily for office and rent facilities 
rent expense charged to operations under all our leases for the fiscal year ended january  was approximately million 
the impact that our contractual obligations as of january  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt operating leases total debt obligations due to be repaid in the months following january  are expected to be satisfied with operating cash flows 
we believe that cash flows from operating activities  together with borrowings available under our revolver  will be sufficient for the next months to fund currently anticipated capital expenditure requirements  debt service requirements and working capital requirements

the repurchase program allows for shares to be purchased from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
no shares will be purchased from artal luxembourg or its affiliates under the program 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased  shares of stock in the open market for a total of million 
as of december   we had one million shares of series a preferred stock issued and outstanding with a preference value of million 
holders of the series a preferred stock were entitled to receive dividends at an annual rate of payable annually in arrears 
on march   we redeemed all of our series a preferred stock held by heinz for a redemption price of million plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
the redemption was financed through additional borrowings of million under the credit facility and cash from operations 
factors affecting future liquidity any future acquisitions  joint ventures or other similar transactions could require additional capital and we cannot be certain that any additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure requirements  interest  principal and dividend payment obligations and working capital requirements and to comply with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements depends on our future operations  performance and cash flow 
these are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
off balance sheet transactions as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
seasonality our business is seasonal  with revenues generally decreasing at year end and during the summer months 
our advertising schedule supports the three key enrollment generating seasons of the year winter  spring and fall 
due to the timing of our marketing expenditures  particularly the higher level of expenditures in the first quarter  our operating income for the second quarter is generally the strongest  with the fourth quarter being the weakest 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  fin r 
fin r replaces the same titled fin that was issued in january fin r identifies when entities must be consolidated with the financial statements of a company where the investors in an entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or the entity does not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the provisions of this interpretation are effective for us beginning the first quarter of fiscal we have evaluated our relationship with our franchisees and based on this guidance  determined they are not variable interest entities and therefore will not be consolidated with our results 
we are in the process of assessing our relationship with our licensee  weightwatchers 
com  with respect to fin r 
we have not reached a conclusion on this matter 
should we conclude that weightwatchers 
com is a variable interest entity meeting the requirements of fin r we would be required to consolidate it 
as of december   weightwatchers 
com had total assets of million  total stockholders deficit of million  and an accumulated deficit of million 
for the year ended december   weightwatchers 
com had net income of million 
forward looking statements certain statements in this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contain not only historical information  but also forward looking statements regarding expectations for our future performance 
forward looking statements involve risk and uncertainty 
please see cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements on pages of this annual report on form k for a discussion of factors which could cause our future results to differ from current expectations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the fair value of long term fixed rate debt and interest expense of variable rate debt 
we have historically managed interest rates through the use of  and our long term debt is currently composed of  a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings 
generally  the fair market value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
based on the overall interest rate exposure on our fixed rate borrowings at january   a change in market interest rates would have less than a impact on the fair value of our long term debt 
based on variable rate debt levels at january   a change in market interest rates would have less than a impact on our net interest expense 
other than inter company transactions between our domestic and foreign entities and the remaining portion of our senior subordinated notes that are denominated in euros  we generally do not have significant transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each entity 
we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies to reduce the currency risk associated with fluctuating exchange rates 
these contracts are used primarily to hedge payments arising from some of our foreign currency denominated obligations 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from these transactions are included in net income for the period 
in addition  we enter into interest rate swaps to hedge a substantial portion of our variable rate debt 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives will be recorded each period in earnings for non qualifying derivatives or accumulated other comprehensive income loss for qualifying derivatives 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also impact our shareholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  fluctuations in the value of the euro will cause the us dollar translated amounts to change in comparison to prior periods 
furthermore  we revalue our outstanding senior subordinated euro notes at the end of each period and the resulting change in value will be reflected in the income statement of the corresponding period 
each of our subsidiaries derives revenues and incurs expenses primarily within a single country and  consequently  does not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of normal business operations 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to more properly align the underlying sources of cash flow with our debt servicing requirements 
at january   we had a long term foreign currency forward contract receivable with a notional amount of million approximately million  offset by a foreign currency forward contract payable with a notional amount of million
