item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company  through its subsidiaries  underwrites a diverse portfolio of group employee benefit products  primarily group life  disability  and excess workers compensation insurance 
revenues from this group of products are primarily comprised of earned premiums and investment income 
the profitability of group employee benefit products is affected by  among other things  differences between actual and projected claims experience  the retention of existing customers and the company s ability to attract new customers  change premium rates and contract terms and control administrative expenses 
the company transfers its exposure to some group employee benefit risks through reinsurance ceded arrangements with other insurance and reinsurance companies 
therefore  the profitability of group employee benefit products is affected by the amount  cost and terms of reinsurance obtained by the company 
profitability of certain group employee benefit products is also affected by the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
the company is currently experiencing particularly favorable market conditions for its excess workers compensation products  and believes that this trend will continue for some time  due to the growing shift among employers toward self insuring their workers compensation risks in light of higher primary workers compensation rates 
for its other group employee benefit products  the company is maintaining its underwriting discipline under competitive market conditions  and is increasing the size of its sales force in order to enhance its focus on the small case niche insured groups of to individuals  including employers which are first time providers of these employee benefits  which it believes to offer opportunities for superior profitability 
the company also operates an asset accumulation business that focuses primarily on offering fixed annuities to individuals 
deposits from the company s asset accumulation business consist of new annuity sales  which are recorded as liabilities rather than as premiums 
revenues from the company s asset accumulation business are primarily comprised of investment income earned on the funds under management 
the profitability of asset accumulation products is primarily dependent on the spread achieved between the return on investments and the interest credited to annuity holders 
the company is disciplined in setting the crediting rates offered on its asset accumulation products in order to achieve its targeted interest rate spreads on these products  and is willing to accept lower levels of sales on these products when market conditions make these targeted spreads more difficult to achieve 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management  in some instances  to make judgments about the application of these principles 
the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period could differ materially from the amounts reported if different conditions existed or different judgments were utilized 
a discussion of how management applies certain critical accounting policies is presented below under the caption critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition of the company 
in addition  a discussion of uncertainties and contingencies which can affect actual results and could cause actual results to ultimately differ materially from those described below can be found under the caption forward looking statements and cautionary statements regarding certain factors that may affect future results 
results of operations compared to summary of results 
net income was million  or per diluted share  in as compared to million  or per diluted share  in net income in and included realized investment gains losses net of the related income tax effects of million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
net income in also included a loss on extinguishment of debt net of an income tax benefit of million  or per diluted share 
the increase in net income in is also attributable to growth in income from group employee benefit products and net investment income partially offset by an increase in interest expense 
premiums from the company s core group employee benefit products increased in and the combined ratio loss ratio plus expense ratio remained at the same level as net investment income increased in primarily due to a increase in average invested assets 
the increase in interest expense resulted from the company s issuance of the senior notes and the capital securities 
management believes the non gaap financial measure of operating earnings is informative when analyzing the trends relating to the company s insurance operations 
operating earnings exclude realized investment gains and losses and gains and losses on extinguishment of debt  because these items arise from events that  to a significant extent  are within management s discretion and can fluctuate significantly  thus distorting comparisons between periods 
investment gains and losses may be realized based on management s decision to dispose of an investment or management s judgment that a decline in the market value of an investment is other than temporary 
gains and losses on extinguishment of debt may be realized based on management s decision to repay or repurchase debt 
thus  realized investment gains and losses and gains and losses on extinguishment of debt are not reflective of the company s ongoing earnings capacity  and trends in the earnings of the company s underlying insurance operations can be more clearly identified without the effects of these gains and losses 
for these reasons  management uses the measure of operating earnings to assess performance and make operating decisions  and the company understands that analysts and investors typically utilize measures of this type when evaluating the financial performance of insurers 
however  gains and losses of these types  particularly as to investments  are likely to occur periodically and should not be considered as nonrecurring items 
further  operating earnings should not be considered a substitute for net income as an indication of the company s overall performance and may not be calculated in the same manner as similarly titled captions in other companies financial statements 
operating earnings for the company  consisting of net income adjusted to exclude realized investment gains losses and a loss on extinguishment of debt both net of the related income tax effects  were million  or per diluted share  in as compared to million  or per diluted share  in the increase in operating earnings in the current period is primarily attributable to the growth in income from group employee benefit products and net investment income partially offset by the increase in interest expense 
premium and fee income 
premium and fee income in was million as compared to million in  an increase of 
premiums from core group employee benefit products increased to million in from million in this increase reflects normal growth in employment and salary levels for the company s existing customer base  price increases  and strong production of new business 
core group employee benefit products include group life  disability  excess workers compensation  travel accident and dental insurance 
see business group employee benefit products 
premiums from excess workers compensation insurance for self insured employers increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the favorable pricing environment and strong demand for this product driven by a growing shift among employers toward self insuring their workers compensation risks due to higher primary workers compensation rates 
sncc obtained average price increases above in connection with its renewals of insurance coverage during  and has continued to obtain significant improvements in contract terms  in particular higher sir levels  in these renewals 
on average  sirs increased in sncc has continued to obtain average price increases of on its renewals and sir levels on average are up 
new business production  which represents the amount of new annualized premium sold  for excess workers compensation products increased to million in from million in in addition  retention of existing customers for excess workers compensation products in was higher than in premiums from the company s other core group employee benefit products increased to million in from million in  reflecting an improvement in the retention of existing customers and strong production growth in new business production for the company s other core group employee benefit products was million in and million in the level of production achieved in reflects the company s maintaining its underwriting discipline under competitive market conditions for these products and across the board price increases on new long term disability business to reflect the lower discount rates on reserves implemented in the company continues to implement price increases for certain existing disability and group life customers 
non core group employee benefit products include lpts  primary workers compensation  bail bond insurance  workers compensation and property catastrophe reinsurance  and reinsurance facilities 
see business group employee benefit products and business reinsurance 
premiums from non core group employee benefit products were million in as compared to million in premiums from non core group employee benefit products in included a high level of premiums from lpts  which are episodic in nature 
the period did not include any premiums from lpts 
deposits from the company s asset accumulation products were million in as compared to million in these deposits consist of new annuity sales  which are recorded as liabilities rather than as premiums 
the company continues to maintain its discipline in setting the crediting rates offered on its asset accumulation products  since the interest rate spreads available on these products remained below average throughout and the decrease in deposits from the company s asset accumulation products in was primarily due to strong equity market performance during the second half of and the continuing low interest rate environment which reduced demand for fixed annuity products 
the company anticipates that the level of deposits attainable for will be similar to the level of deposits achieved in since the company continues to add new networks and independent agents to its distribution channel 
the company plans to maintain its discipline in setting the crediting rates offered on its asset accumulation products in in order to achieve its targeted interest rate spreads on these products 
net investment income 
net investment income in was million as compared to million in  an increase of 
this increase reflects an increase in average invested assets in the tax equivalent weighted average annual yield on invested assets was on average invested assets of  million in and on average invested assets of  million in net realized investment gains losses 
net realized investment gains were million in as compared to net realized investment losses of million in the company s investment strategy results in periodic sales of securities and  therefore  the recognition of realized investment gains and losses 
during and  the company recognized million and million  respectively  of net gains on the sales of securities 
the company monitors its investments on an ongoing basis 
when the market value of a security declines below its cost  and management judges the decline to be other than temporary  the security is written down to fair value  and the decline is reported as a realized investment loss 
in and  the company recognized million and million  respectively  of losses due to the other than temporary declines in the market values of certain fixed maturity and equity securities 
the losses of this type in million on an after tax basis resulted primarily from credit quality related deterioration in the corporate debt markets and the impact of sustained low interest rates on certain interest only securities  and the company may recognize additional losses of this type in the future 
the company anticipates that if certain other existing declines in security values are determined to be other than temporary  it may recognize additional investment losses in the range of million to million  on an after tax basis  with respect to the relevant securities 
however  the extent of any such losses will depend on future market developments and changes in security values  and such losses may be outside this range 
the company continuously monitors the affected securities pursuant to its procedures for evaluation for other than temporary impairment in valuation 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies for a description of these procedures  which take into account a number of factors 
it is not possible to predict the extent of any future changes in value  positive or negative  or the results of the future application of these procedures  with respect to these securities 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize investment gains in the future in an amount sufficient to offset any such losses 
benefits and expenses 
policyholder benefits and expenses were million as compared to million in  an increase of 
this increase primarily reflects the increase in premiums from the company s group employee benefit products discussed above 
the combined ratio loss ratio plus expense ratio for the company s group employee benefits segment was in and in interest expense 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in  an increase of million 
this increase primarily resulted from the company s issuance of the senior notes and the capital securities in may and the fact that the senior notes and the matured senior notes were simultaneously outstanding until the matured senior notes could be repaid at their maturity in october income tax expense 
income tax expense was million in as compared to million in the income tax expense benefit attributable to net realized investment gains losses was million and million in and  respectively

net income in and also included a loss gain on extinguishment of debt and capital securities net of the related income tax effects of million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share 
the increase in net income in was also attributable to a decrease in interest expense million after taxes  and charges in the period for goodwill amortization million after taxes and reserve strengthening million after taxes 
excluding the effects of the reserve strengthening and goodwill amortization in  income from group employee benefit products increased in as compared to management believes the non gaap financial measure of operating earnings is informative when analyzing the trends relating to the company s insurance operations 
operating earnings exclude realized investment gains and losses and gains and losses on extinguishment of debt and capital securities  because these items arise from events that  to a significant extent  are within management s discretion and can fluctuate significantly  thus distorting comparison between periods

core group employee benefit products include group life  disability  excess workers compensation  travel accident and dental insurance 
premiums from excess workers compensation insurance for self insured employers increased to million in from million in primarily due to improvements in the pricing environment and demand for this product as a result of higher primary workers compensation rates 
sncc was able to obtain significant price increases in connection with its renewals of insurance coverage during  with increases exceeding on a substantial portion of such renewals 
sncc also obtained significant improvements in contract terms  in particular higher sir levels  in these renewals 
on average  sirs increased in new business production  which represents the amount of new annualized premium sold  for excess workers compensation products increased to million in from million in and the retention of existing customers was consistent with sncc s goals 
premiums from the company s other core group employee benefit products increased to million in from million in  reflecting strong production growth in new business production for the company s other core group employee benefit products increased to million in from million in primarily due to the expansion of the company s sales force during and  and the opening of three new sales offices in the company also implemented price increases for certain disability customers 
non core group employee benefit products include lpts  primary workers compensation  bail bond insurance  workers compensation and property catastrophe reinsurance  and reinsurance facilities 
premiums from non core group employee benefit products increased to million in from million in primarily due to a higher level of premium from lpts  which are episodic in nature 
deposits from the company s asset accumulation products were million in as compared to million in these deposits consist of new annuity sales  which are recorded as liabilities rather than as premiums 
the company maintained its disciplined approach to setting the crediting rates offered on its asset accumulation products since market interest rates and the resulting interest rate spreads available to the company on these products remained less favorable throughout and the increase in deposits from the company s asset accumulation products in was higher than expected due to the pullback of certain fixed annuity providers from the wholesale distribution chain and heightened demand for fixed annuity products as a result of adverse conditions in the equity markets 
net investment income 
net investment income in was million as compared to million in  an increase of 
this increase primarily reflects an increase in average invested assets in  partially offset by a decrease in the tax equivalent weighted average annual yield 
the tax equivalent weighted average annual yield on invested assets was on average invested assets of  million in and on average invested assets of  million in net realized investment losses 
net realized investment losses were million in as compared to million in the company s investment strategy results in periodic sales of securities and  therefore  the recognition of realized investment gains and losses 
the company monitors its investments on an ongoing basis 
when the market value of a security declines below its cost  and management judges the decline to be other than temporary  the security is written down to fair value  and the decline is reported as a realized investment loss 
in and  the company recognized million and million  respectively  of losses due to the other than temporary declines in the market values of certain fixed maturity and equity securities 
during the same periods  the company recognized million and million  respectively  of net gains on sales of securities 
loss gain on extinguishment of debt and capital securities 
in the second quarter of  the company repurchased million aggregate principal amount of the matured senior notes  resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million 
during  the company repurchased million liquidation amount of the capital securities in the open market 
in june  the company also repurchased million aggregate principal amount of the matured senior notes 
in  the company recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt and capital securities of million in connection with the repurchases of the capital securities and matured senior notes 
benefits and expenses 
policyholder benefits and expenses were million as compared to million in  an increase of 
this increase primarily reflects the increase in premiums from the company s group employee benefit products discussed above 
benefits and expenses in include a pre tax charge of million for reserve strengthening primarily related to an unusually high number of large losses in the company s excess workers compensation business 
prior to  sncc s historical average for losses exceeding million in its workers compensation products was one to two per year 
in  however  the company experienced seven such losses  including two losses as a result of the terrorist attacks on the world trade center 
the case reserves for these seven losses totaled million  including million attributable to the world trade center attacks 
though the company believed that the high number of large losses in was unlikely to recur  the company added million to its reserve for ibnr losses since its method of estimating ibnr reserves is based on past experience 
in the years subsequent to  the number of large losses experienced by the company returned to the company s pre historical average 
the company also added million to its long term disability ibnr reserves for potential mental and nervous disability claims related to the world trade center attacks 
this reserve strengthening charge reduced net income by million  or per diluted share 
the combined ratio loss ratio plus expense ratio for the company s group employee benefits segment was in and excluding the reserve strengthening in the combined ratio in reflects the higher levels of reserves which were established for the company s excess workers compensation products due to the high number of large losses in this combined ratio also reflects the large amount of new business production from the company s other core group employee benefit products  for which initial reserves have been set at higher levels until actual loss experience emerges 
the higher level of premium from lpts  which carry a higher loss ratio  also contributed to the higher combined ratio in interest expense 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in  a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily a result of the company s repurchase of million liquidation amount of the capital securities in the open market  which occurred on various dates during the first nine months of  and a lower weighted average borrowing rate under the company s revolving credit facilities 
in addition  the company had a lower amount of borrowings outstanding during the year ended under its matured senior notes and sig s senior notes the sig senior notes due may income tax expense benefit

the income tax benefit expense related to the loss gain on extinguishment of debt and capital securities was million and million  respectively 
the income tax benefit in was also attributable to the reserve strengthening charge 
the company s effective tax rate excluding net realized investment losses  the loss gain on extinguishment of debt and capital securities and the reserve strengthening was in and in liquidity and capital resources general 
the company had approximately million of financial resources available at the holding company level at december   which was primarily comprised of short term investments  investments in the common stock of its investment subsidiaries  and fixed maturity securities 
the assets of the investment subsidiaries are primarily invested in balances with independent investment managers 
a shelf registration statement is also in effect under which securities yielding proceeds of up to million may be issued by the company 
on may   the company issued million of the senior notes in a public offering pursuant to the company s existing shelf registration 
the proceeds from this issuance were used to repay all of the then outstanding borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility and to repay at maturity the matured senior notes 
see business other transactions and note e to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the issuance of the senior notes  under the terms of the company s revolving credit facility  the maximum amount of borrowings available to the company thereunder was reduced from million to million and the facility was converted to an unsecured facility  with collateral being released to the company 
the company did not have any borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising before the issuance of the senior notes could be completed  the company entered into a treasury rate lock agreement in september  with a notional amount of million and an anticipated debt term of years 
the company paid million upon the issuance of the senior notes in may to settle the treasury rate lock agreement 
see business other transactions and note e to the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the company also issued million liquidation amount of capital securities in a private placement 
see note k to the consolidated financial statements 
the company also made the final million principal payment on the sig senior notes in may and repaid in full the million principal amount due on the subordinated notes in june in december  the company and its existing lenders agreed to amend certain terms of the company s revolving credit facility  primarily the maturity date of the company s revolving credit facility  which was extended from december  to december  other sources of liquidity at the holding company level include dividends paid from subsidiaries  primarily generated from operating cash flows and investments 
during  the company s insurance subsidiaries will be permitted  without prior regulatory approval  to make dividend payments totaling the life insurance subsidiaries and sncc may also pay additional dividends with the requisite regulatory approvals 
see business regulation 
in general  dividends from the company s non insurance subsidiaries are not subject to regulatory or other restrictions 
at december   the company had million of borrowings available to it under its revolving credit facility 
the company s current liquidity needs  in addition to funding its operating expenses  include principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility  interest payments on the senior notes  and dividends on the capital securities and the capital securities 
the senior notes mature in their entirety in may and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements but are redeemable by the company at par at any time on or after may  the junior subordinated debentures underlying the capital securities are not redeemable prior to march  the junior subordinated debentures underlying the capital securities are redeemable  in whole or in part  beginning may  see notes e and k to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
the senior notes and the junior subordinated debentures underlying the capital securities are assumed to be repaid on their respective maturity dates 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  as referenced in the table contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in thousands corporate debt note e   interest on corporate debt note e      advances from federal home loan bank note f    interest on advances from federal home loan bank note f      company obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities of subsidiaries note k   dividends on capital securities note k      operating lease obligations note n      total contractual obligations      primarily includes interest on the senior notes 
includes dividends on the outstanding capital securities and the capital securities 
interest on the capital securities was computed using the indexed rate in effect at december  of sources of liquidity available to the company on a parent company only basis  including the undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries and additional borrowings available under the company s revolving credit facility  are expected to exceed the company s current and long term cash requirements 
the company from time to time engages in discussions with respect to acquiring blocks of business and insurance and financial services companies  any of which could  if consummated  be material to the company s operations 
the principal liquidity requirements of the company s insurance subsidiaries are their contractual obligations to policyholders and other financing sources 
the primary sources of funding for these obligations  in addition to operating earnings  are the marketable investments included in the investment portfolios of these subsidiaries 
the company actively manages its investment portfolio to match its invested assets and related liabilities 
the company regularly analyzes the results of its asset liability matching through cash flow analysis and duration matching under multiple interest rate scenarios 
see asset liability management and market risk 
therefore  the company believes that these sources of funding will be adequate for its insurance subsidiaries to satisfy on both a short term and long term basis these contractual obligations throughout their estimated or stated period 
cash flows 
operating activities increased cash by million and million in and  respectively 
operating activities in  which include million of cash provided by the liquidation of trading account securities and million of funds received from oracle re for the commutation of various reinsurance agreements that the company had entered into with oracle re in  increased cash by million 
see note q to the consolidated financial statements 
share repurchase program 
the company s board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program 
share repurchases are effected by the company in the open market or in negotiated transactions in compliance with the safe harbor provisions of rule b under the securities exchange act of execution of the share repurchase program is based on management s assessment of market conditions for its common stock and other potential uses of capital 
during the first quarter of  the company repurchased  shares of its class a common stock at a total cost of million  for a volume weighted average price of 
the company did not repurchase any shares in the second  third or fourth quarters of at december   the repurchase of approximately million shares remained authorized under this program 
investments 
the company s overall investment strategy emphasizes safety and liquidity  while seeking the best available return  by focusing on  among other things  managing the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities and seeking to minimize the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s investment portfolio  which totaled  million at december   primarily consists of investments in fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
the market value of the company s investment portfolio  in relation to its amortized cost  improved by million during  before related changes in the cost of business acquired of million and the income tax provision of million 
in addition  the company recognized pre tax net investment gains of million in the weighted average credit rating of the company s fixed maturity portfolio as rated by standard poor s corporation was aa at december  while the investment grade rating of the company s fixed maturity portfolio addresses credit risk  it does not address other risks  such as prepayment and extension risks  which are discussed below 
at december   approximately of the company s total invested assets were comprised of corporate fixed maturity securities 
eighty seven percent of the company s corporate fixed maturity portfolio  based on fair values  has been rated investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities are distributed among the various rating categories as follows aaa  aa  a  and bbb 
corporate fixed maturity securities subject the company to credit risk and  to a lesser extent  interest rate risk 
to reduce its exposure to corporate credit risk  the company diversifies its investments across economic sectors  industry classes and issuers 
mortgage backed securities comprised of the company s total invested assets at december  ninety five percent of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio  based on fair values  has been rated as investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
mortgage backed securities subject the company to a degree of interest rate risk  including prepayment and extension risk  which is generally a function of the sensitivity of each security s underlying collateral to prepayments under varying interest rate environments and the repayment priority of the securities in the particular securitization structure 
the company seeks to limit the extent of this risk by emphasizing the more predictable payment classes and securities with stable collateral 
the company  through its insurance subsidiaries  maintains a program in which investments are financed using advances from various federal home loan banks 
the company has utilized this program to manage the duration of its liabilities and to earn spread income  which is the difference between the financing cost and the earnings from the investments purchased with those funds 
at december   the company had outstanding advances of million 
the advances were obtained at a fixed rate and have a weighted average term to maturity of years 
a total of million of these advances will mature at various times during in addition  the company has utilized reverse repurchase agreements  futures and option contracts and interest rate swap contracts from time to time in connection with its investment strategy 
these transactions require the company to maintain securities or cash on deposit with the applicable counterparty as collateral 
as the market value of the collateral or contracts changes  the company may be required to deposit additional collateral or be entitled to have a portion of the collateral returned to it 
the types and amounts of investments made by the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile 
each of these states has comprehensive investment regulations 
in addition  the company s revolving credit facility also contains limitations  with which the company is currently in compliance in all material respects  on the composition of the company s investment portfolio 
the company also continually monitors its investment portfolio and attempts to ensure that the risks associated with concentrations of investments in either a particular sector of the market or a single entity are limited 
asset liability management and market risk 
because the company s primary assets and liabilities are financial in nature  the company s consolidated financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by active portfolio management focusing on minimizing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by matching its invested assets and related liabilities and by periodically adjusting the crediting rates on its annuity products and the discount rate used to calculate reserves on the company s other products 
in addition  the company  at times  has utilized exchange traded futures and option contracts and interest rate swap agreements to reduce the risk associated with changes in the value of its fixed maturity portfolio due to changes in the interest rate environment and to reduce the risk associated with changes in interest rates in connection with anticipated securities purchases and debt refinancing 
at december   the company had no outstanding futures or option contracts or interest rate swap agreements 
the company  at times  may also invest in non dollar denominated fixed maturity securities that expose it to fluctuations in foreign currency rates  and therefore  may hedge such exposure by using currency forward contracts 
the company s investment in non dollar denominated fixed maturity securities during was less than of total invested assets 
the company regularly analyzes the results of its asset liability matching through cash flow analysis and duration matching under multiple interest rate scenarios 
these analyses enable the company to measure the potential gain or loss in fair value of its interest rate sensitive financial instruments due to hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based on these analyses  if interest rates were to immediately increase by from their year end levels  the fair value of the company s interest sensitive assets  net of corresponding changes in the fair value of cost of business acquired and insurance and investment related liabilities  would decline by approximately million at december  as compared to a decline of approximately million at december  these analyses incorporate numerous assumptions and estimates and assume no changes in the composition of the company s investment portfolio in reaction to such interest rate changes 
consequently  the results of this analysis will likely be materially different from the actual changes experienced under given interest rate scenarios 
the company manages the composition of its borrowed capital by considering factors such as the ratio of borrowed capital to total capital  future debt requirements  the interest rate environment and other market conditions 
the company s outstanding corporate debt at december  was issued at a fixed interest rate 
at december   a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates would cause a corresponding million increase in the fair value of the company s fixed rate corporate debt which matures in at december   a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates would cause a corresponding million increase in the fair value of the company s fixed rate corporate debt which matured in in may  the company paid million upon the issuance of the senior notes to settle the treasury rate lock agreement 
at december   a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates would cause a corresponding million increase in the fair value of the treasury rate lock agreement 
because interest expense on the company s floating rate corporate debt that was outstanding at december  would have fluctuated as prevailing interest rates changed  changes in market interest rates would not have materially affected its fair value 
reinsurance 
the company cedes portions of the risks relating to its group employee benefit products under indemnity reinsurance agreements with various unaffiliated reinsurers 
the company pays reinsurance premiums generally based upon percentages of the company s premiums on the business reinsured 
these agreements expire at various intervals as to new risks  and replacement agreements are negotiated on terms believed appropriate in light of current market conditions 
during  the company replaced certain of its existing reinsurance arrangements for its excess workers compensation and long term disability products 
under the replacement arrangements for excess workers compensation products  the company reinsures excess workers compensation risks between million compared to million previously and million  and a majority in proportionate amount of the risks between million and million  per policy per occurrence 
for long term disability products  effective october  for new policies and  for existing policies  the earlier of the next policy anniversary date or october   the company will reinsure risks in excess of  compared to  previously in benefits per individual per month 
these changes will reduce the reinsurance premiums paid by the company for these products 
however  in the case of long term disability products  management does not believe that this reduction is sufficient to compensate for the anticipated level of losses in the  to  layer of monthly benefits for which the company retains the risk under the new reinsurance arrangement 
the company is implementing a variety of initiatives  including pricing and underwriting initiatives  for these products  however  there can be no assurance that such initiatives will be successful 
if such initiatives are not successful  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
see forward looking statements and cautionary statements regarding certain factors that may affect future results 
sncc performance contingent options 
in may  the company granted performance contingent incentive options to purchase  shares of the company s class a common stock to each of the five members of executive management of sncc  for a total of  options 
the options  which have a ten year term and whose exercise price is equal to the fair market value of a share of such stock on the grant date as determined in accordance with the company option plan under which the options were granted  will become exercisable only to the extent that sig  sncc s parent company  meets specified cumulative financial performance targets for the three or five fiscal year periods beginning with the current year  otherwise  such options will be forfeited 
these targets  as described below  generally require that sig s aggregate consolidated pre tax operating income  as defined and computed under each of the related option agreements ptoi  increases during these periods at an annual average rate of over for any of the options to become exercisable  and at an annual average rate of at least for the options to become fully exercisable 
 of each executive s options will become exercisable if sig s ptoi  for the three year performance period is at least million  otherwise  a reduced number of such options will become exercisable to the extent that ptoi for such period exceeds million  determined by interpolating between zero and  according to where the ptoi amount falls in the range between million and million 
 of each executive s options minus the number of any options that become exercisable for the three year performance period will become exercisable if sig s aggregate ptoi for the five year performance period is at least million  otherwise  a reduced number of such options will become exercisable to the extent that ptoi for such period exceeds million  determined by interpolating between zero and  according to where the ptoi amount falls in the range between million and million 
under the option agreements  the formula for determining ptoi incorporates various pro forma adjustments and assumptions in order to focus on the performance of sncc s insurance operations  for example  the formula contains certain assumptions relating to investment income and expenses for the relevant periods  and excludes realized investment gains and losses 
accordingly  the ptoi amounts that would result in the applicable financial performance targets being met will not be the same as sig s income before income tax expense  calculated in accordance with gaap  for the relevant periods 
the company believes that these options will provide substantial incentives for these executives to contribute toward sncc s attaining the specified targets  thereby enhancing the company s financial performance  however  no assurance can be given that such results will be achieved 
the company will recognize compensation expense for these options under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
over the performance period 
the compensation expense associated with these options will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company s management  in some instances  to make judgments about the application of these principles 
the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period could differ materially from the amounts reported if different conditions existed or different judgments were utilized 
management s judgment is most critical in the estimation of its liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses and its assets for cost of business acquired and in the valuation of its investments 
a discussion of how management applies these critical accounting policies follows 
future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the company establishes reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses relating to its insurance products 
these reserves  which totaled  million at december   represent management s best estimate of future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the reserves are calculated using various generally recognized actuarial methodologies and are based upon assumptions that management believes are appropriate and which vary by type of product 
annually  external actuarial experts also review the company s methodologies  assumptions and the resulting reserves 
the company s projected ultimate insurance liabilities and associated reserves are estimates  which are subject to variability 
this variability arises because the factors and events affecting the ultimate liability for claims have not all taken place  and thus cannot be evaluated with certainty 
the estimation process is complex and involves information obtained from company specific and industry wide data  as well as general economic information 
the most significant assumptions made in the estimation process for future policy benefits relate to mortality  morbidity  claim termination and discount rates 
the reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses are determined on an individual basis for reported claims and estimates of ibnr losses are developed on the basis of past experience 
the most significant assumptions made in the estimation process for unpaid claims and claim expenses are the trend in loss costs  the expected frequency and severity of claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
the assumptions vary based on the year the claim is incurred 
at december   disability and excess workers compensation reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses with a carrying value of million have been discounted at a weighted average rate of  with the rates ranging from to 
disability reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses are discounted using interest rate assumptions based upon projected portfolio yield rates for the assets supporting the liabilities 
the assets selected to support these liabilities produce cash flows that are intended to match the timing and amount of anticipated claim and claim expense payments 
excess workers compensation claim reserves are discounted using interest rate assumptions based on the risk free rate of return for us government securities with a duration comparable to the expected duration and payment pattern of the claims at the time the claims are settled 
the rates used to discount reserves are determined annually 
the methods and assumptions used to establish reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses are continually reviewed and updated based on current circumstances  and any resulting adjustments are reflected in earnings currently 
there have been no material changes in the actuarial assumptions and or methods from those used in the previous periods other than those resulting from the unusually high number of large losses in the company s excess workers compensation business in if the company s actual loss experience from its current or discontinued products is different from the company s assumptions or estimates  the company s reserves could be inadequate 
in such event  the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
deferred acquisition costs 
costs related to the acquisition of new insurance business  such as commissions  certain costs of policy issuance and underwriting  and certain sales office expenses  are deferred when incurred 
the unamortized balance of these deferred acquisition costs is included in cost of business acquired on the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred acquisition costs related to group life  disability and accident products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the anticipated premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the present value of annual expected premium income to the present value of the total expected premium income 
deferred acquisition costs related to casualty insurance products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the period in which the related premium is earned 
deferred acquisition costs related to annuity products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the anticipated lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from such policies surrender charges and mortality  investment and expense margins 
the amortization is a constant percentage of estimated gross profits based on the ratio of the present value of amounts deferred as compared to the present value of estimated gross profits 
adjustments are made each year to reflect the actual gross profits to date as compared to assumed experience and any changes in the remaining expected future gross profits 
the unamortized balance of deferred policy acquisition costs related to certain asset accumulation products is adjusted for the impact on estimated future gross profits as if net unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities had been realized at the balance sheet date 
the impact of this adjustment  net of the related income tax expense or benefit  is included in net unrealized appreciation and depreciation as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
deferred acquisition costs are charged to current earnings to the extent that it is determined that future premiums or estimated gross profits will not be adequate to cover the amounts deferred 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts represented  and  respectively  of the total amounts of the deferred acquisition cost balances outstanding at the beginning of the respective periods 
investments 
investments are primarily carried at fair value with unrealized appreciation and depreciation included as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity  net of the related income tax benefit or expense and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired 
ninety nine percent of the company s fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio are actively traded in a liquid market or have other liquidity mechanisms 
securities acquired through private placements  which are not actively traded in a liquid market and do not have other mechanisms for their liquidation  totaled million at december  the company estimates the fair value for these securities primarily by comparison to similar securities with quoted market prices 
if quotes are not available on similar securities  the company estimates fair value based on recent purchases or sales of similar securities or other internally prepared valuations 
key assumptions used in this process include the level of risk free interest rates  risk premiums  and performance of underlying collateral  if applicable 
all such investments are classified as available for sale 
the company s ability to liquidate these investments in a timely manner  if necessary  may be adversely impacted by the lack of an actively traded market 
historically  the company has not realized amounts on dispositions of non marketable investments that varied materially from the amounts estimated by the company under this valuation methodology 
the company believes that its estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of these securities  however  had there been an active market for these securities during the applicable reporting period  the market prices may have been materially different than the amounts reported 
declines in the fair value of investments that are considered in the judgment of management to be other than temporary are reported as realized investment losses 
the company evaluates  among other things  the financial position and prospects of the issuer  conditions in the issuer s industry and geographic area  liquidity of the investment  changes in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the investment  and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating agency to determine if and when a decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost is other than temporary 
the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment is lower than its amortized cost and the company s ability and intent to retain the investment to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment s fair value are also considered 
in  and  the company recognized losses totaling million  million and million  respectively  for the other than temporary decline in the value of certain securities 
these losses were recognized as a result of events that occurred in the respective periods  such as downgrades in an issuer s credit ratings  deteriorating financial results of issuers  adverse changes in the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows from securities and the impact of the recessionary economic environment on issuers financial positions 
investment grade and non investment grade fixed maturity securities comprised and  respectively  of the company s total investment portfolio at december  gross unrealized appreciation and gross unrealized depreciation  before the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  attributable to investment grade fixed maturity securities totaled million and million  respectively  at december  gross unrealized appreciation and gross unrealized depreciation  before the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  attributable to non investment grade fixed maturity securities totaled million and million  respectively  at december  unrealized appreciation and depreciation  net of the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  has been reflected on the company s balance sheet as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
the company anticipates that if certain existing declines in security values are determined to be other than temporary  it may recognize additional investment losses in the range of million to million pre tax million to million on an after tax basis with respect to the relevant securities 
however  the extent of any such losses will depend on future market developments and changes in security values  and such losses may exceed or be lower than such range 
it is not possible to predict the extent of any future changes in value  positive or negative  or the results of the future application of the company s procedures for the evaluation of other than temporary impairment in valuation 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize investment gains in the future in an amount sufficient to offset any such losses 
the company also invests in balances with independent investment managers  consisting primarily of investments in limited partnerships which invest in various financial instruments 
these investments are reflected in the company s financial statements under the equity method  accordingly  positive or negative changes in the value of the partnerships underlying investments are included in net investment income 
for this purpose  the company estimates the values of its balances with independent investment managers based on values provided by the managers  as adjusted based on available information concerning the underlying investment portfolios 
such adjustments resulted in reductions in value of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the company believes that its estimates reasonably reflect the values of its balances with independent investment managers  however  there can be no assurance that such values will ultimately be realized upon liquidation of such balances 
forward looking statements and cautionary statements regarding certain factors that may affect future results in connection with  and because it desires to take advantage of  the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company cautions readers regarding certain forward looking statements in the above management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this form k and in any other statement made by  or on behalf of  the company  whether in future filings with the securities and exchange commission or otherwise 
forward looking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations  strategies  financial results  prospects  outlooks or other developments 
some forward looking statements may be identified by the use of terms such as expects  believes  anticipates  intends  judgment or other similar expressions 
forward looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business  economic  competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the company s control and many of which  with respect to future business decisions  are subject to change 
examples of such uncertainties and contingencies include  among other important factors  those affecting the insurance industry generally  such as the economic and interest rate environment  federal and state legislative and regulatory developments  including but not limited to changes in financial services and tax laws and regulations  market pricing and competitive trends relating to insurance products and services  acts of terrorism or war  and the availability and cost of reinsurance  and those relating specifically to the company s business  such as the level of its insurance premiums and fee income  the claims experience  persistency and other factors affecting the profitability of its insurance products  the performance of its investment portfolio and changes in the company s investment strategy  acquisitions of companies or blocks of business  and ratings by major rating organizations of its insurance subsidiaries 
these uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
certain of these uncertainties and contingencies are described in more detail in the remainder of this section 
the company disclaims any obligation to update forward looking information 
reserves established for future policy benefits and claims may prove inadequate 
the company s reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses are estimates 
see critical accounting policies future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses for a description of the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process 
these estimates are subject to variability  since the factors and events affecting the ultimate liability for claims have not all taken place  and thus cannot be evaluated with certainty 
moreover  under the actuarial methodologies discussed previously  these estimates are subject to reevaluation based on developing trends with respect to the company s loss experience 
such trends may emerge over longer periods of time  and changes in such trends cannot necessarily be identified or predicted at any given time by reference to current claims experience  whether favorable or unfavorable 
if the company s actual loss experience from its current or discontinued products is different from the company s assumptions or estimates  the company s reserves could be inadequate 
in such event  the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the market values of the company s investments fluctuate 
the market values of the company s investments vary depending on economic and market conditions  including interest rates  and such values can decline as a result of changes in such conditions 
increasing interest rates or a widening in the spread between interest rates available on us treasury securities and corporate debt  for example  will typically have an adverse impact on the market values of the fixed maturity securities in the company s investment portfolio 
if interest rates decline  the company generally achieves a lower overall rate of return on investments of cash generated from the company s operations 
in addition  in the event that investments are called or mature in a declining interest rate environment  the company may be unable to reinvest the proceeds in securities with comparable interest rates 
the company may also in the future be required or determine to sell certain investments at a price and a time when the market value of such investments is less than the book value of such investments 
declines in the fair value of investments that are considered in the judgment of management to be other than temporary are reported as realized investment losses 
see critical accounting policies investments for a description of management s evaluation process 
the company has experienced and may in the future experience losses from other than temporary declines in security values 
such losses are recorded as realized investment losses in the income statement 
see results of operations compared to the company s investment strategy exposes the company to default and other risks 
the management of the company s investment portfolio is an important component of the company s profitability since a substantial portion of the company s operating income is generated from the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and  in the case of asset accumulation products  the interest credited on policyholder funds and  in the case of the company s other products for which reserves are discounted  the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
see liquidity and capital resources investments for a description of the company s investment portfolio and strategy 
the company is subject to the risk  among others  that the issuers of the fixed maturity securities the company owns will default on principal and interest payments 
a major economic downturn or any of the various other factors that affect issuers abilities to pay could result in issuer defaults 
because the company s investments consist primarily of fixed maturity securities and short term investments  such defaults could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company continually monitors its investment portfolio and attempts to ensure that the risks associated with concentrations of investments in either a particular sector of the market or a single entity are limited 
the company s financial position exposes the company to interest rate risks 
because the company s primary assets and liabilities are financial in nature  the company s consolidated financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by active portfolio management focusing on minimizing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by matching its invested assets and related liabilities and by periodically adjusting the crediting rates on its annuity products 
see liquidity and capital resources asset liability management and market risk 
profitability of certain group employee benefit products is also affected by the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
the company manages this risk by adjusting the prices charged for these products 
the company s ability to reduce its exposure to risks depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance 
the company transfers its exposure to some risks through reinsurance arrangements with other insurance and reinsurance companies 
under the company s reinsurance arrangements  another insurer assumes a specified portion of the company s losses and loss adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums 
the availability  amount  cost and terms of reinsurance may vary significantly based on market conditions 
any decrease in the amount of the company s reinsurance will increase the company s risk of loss and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will  absent a decrease in the reinsurance amount  reduce the company s premium income 
in either case  the company s operating results could be adversely affected unless it is able to accordingly adjust the prices or other terms of its insurance policies or successfully implement other operational initiatives  as to which no assurance can be given 
furthermore  the company is subject to credit risk with respect to reinsurance 
the company obtains reinsurance primarily through indemnity reinsurance transactions in which the company is still liable for the transferred risks if the reinsurers fail to meet their financial obligations 
such failures could materially affect the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
some reinsurers experienced significant losses related to the terrorist events of september  as a result of this and other market factors  higher prices and less favorable terms and conditions are presently being offered in the reinsurance market 
these market conditions are reflected in the terms of the replacement reinsurance arrangements entered into during for the company s excess workers compensation and long term disability products 
see liquidity and capital resources reinsurance 
it is likely that  in the future  the company s reinsurers will continue to seek price increases  although the extent of such increases cannot currently be predicted 
also  there has been significantly reduced availability of reinsurance covering risks such as terrorist and catastrophic events 
accordingly  substantially all of the company s coverages of this nature were discontinued during  which would result in the company retaining a higher portion of losses from such events if they occur 
the company has not been able to replace such coverages on acceptable terms due to present market conditions  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future 
however  under the terrorism act  the federal government will pay of the company s covered losses relating to acts of international terrorism from property and casualty products directly written by sncc above the company s annual deductible 
see business group employee benefit products 
the occurrence of a significant catastrophic event could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the insurance business is a heavily regulated industry 
the company s insurance subsidiaries  like other insurance companies  are highly regulated by state insurance authorities in the states in which they are domiciled and the other states in which they conduct business 
such regulations  among other things  limit the amount of dividends and other payments that can be made by such subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval and impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments such subsidiaries may have 
these regulations also affect many other aspects of the company s insurance subsidiaries businesses  including  for example  rbc requirements  various reserve requirements  the terms  conditions and manner of sale and marketing of insurance products  claims handling practices and the form and content of required financial statements 
these regulations are intended to protect policyholders rather than investors 
the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to continue to conduct their businesses is dependent upon the maintenance of their licenses in these various states 
from time to time  increased scrutiny has been placed upon the insurance regulatory framework  and a number of state legislatures have considered or enacted legislative measures that alter  and in many cases increase  state authority to regulate insurance companies 
in addition to legislative initiatives of this type  the naic and insurance regulators are continuously involved in a process of reexamining existing laws and regulations and their application to insurance companies 
furthermore  while the federal government currently does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal legislation and administrative policies and court interpretations thereof in a number of areas  such as employee benefits regulation  age  sex and disability based discrimination  financial services regulation and federal taxation  can significantly affect the insurance business 
it is not possible to predict the future impact of changing regulation on the operations of the company and those of its insurance subsidiaries 
the company s insurance subsidiaries can also be required  under solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which they do business  to pay assessments to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insurance companies that become insolvent 
the financial services industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with numerous other insurance and financial services companies 
many of these organizations have substantially greater assets  higher ratings from rating agencies  larger and more diversified portfolios of insurance products and larger agency sales operations than the company 
competition in asset accumulation product markets is also encountered from the expanding number of banks  securities brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries marketing alternative savings products  such as mutual funds  traditional bank investments and retirement funding alternatives 
the company may be adversely impacted by a decline in the ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries 
ratings with respect to claims paying ability and financial strength have become an increasingly important factor impacting the competitive position of insurance companies 
each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings of companies periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained or improved in the future 
claims paying and financial strength ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors 
downgrades in the ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect sales of their products and could have a material adverse effect on the results of the company s operations
