item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
references to we  us or our refer to visual networks  inc and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
overview we were incorporated in maryland in august under the name avail networks  inc and reincorporated in delaware in december as visual networks  inc in  we acquired netnet corporation to accelerate the time to market for our atm performance management products 
acquired products included celltracer and the acquired technology formed the basis of our atm analysis in the visual uptime and celltracer product lines 
in  we acquired inverse network technology in order to enter the performance management space for the public internet 
in this acquisition  we acquired the visual ip insight product and the visual internet benchmark service 
in  we acquired avesta technologies  inc in order to expand our network management portfolio to include products that could identify the underlying root cause of network problems 
with this acquisition  we acquired the visual trinity and visual ewatcher products 
as we refined our strategic direction during  we determined that certain of these acquired products did not fit our strategy or were not as far along in development as we had anticipated  and we began to divest or discontinue certain products 
in  we sold the visual internet benchmark service and discontinued the visual trinity product 
in  the remaining customer for our celltracer product  network associates  placed final orders with us for this product and we formally discontinued it in in addition  we discontinued the visual ewatcher product in after having turned our development and sales focus elsewhere during the following table indicates our revenue from discontinued products for the periods indicated in thousands years ended december  visual internet benchmark visual trinity and ewatcher celltracer discontinued product revenue the demand for our products has been adversely affected by a number of factors resulting in decreasing revenue 
those factors include the continued downturn in the telecommunications industry  which continues to be reflected in depressed demand for telecommunications products and services  including those based on our products  significant competitive pressure on the average selling price of our products  decreased capital spending by end user customers resulting in slower deployment of service provider inventory  tighter inventory control at our service provider customers  and the loss of business to competitors 
in addition  our results of operations were affected adversely by the acquisition of avesta in may that caused a significant immediate increase in operating expenses without an overall increase in revenue 
the deterioration of our operating results that began in was due primarily to decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 
in response  we made significant reductions in operating expenses by closing three facilities and by reducing our workforce by approximately employees from october through december we did not have any workforce reductions in 
table of contents as a result of our focus on reducing operating expenses  we returned to profitability for each quarter in however  we incurred a net loss of million for due to a further reduction in revenue from million to million for  reflecting a reduction in sales for each of our major products 
from to  visual uptime and visual ip insight revenues decreased by million and million  respectively 
revenue from the visual ip insight product often fluctuates due to the timing of sizeable orders placed by a limited number of service providers 
these fluctuations can also significantly affect our gross profits because our software costs of revenue are insignificant 
in addition  revenue related to the sale of discontinued products decreased approximately million  from million in to million in we reduced our operating expenses by million from to to be more in line with our reduced revenue projections 
we have refocused our sales  marketing and other efforts on our core visual uptime and visual ip insight products 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced our new product suite  visual uptime select  in an effort to address market segmentation for visual uptime and to sell more efficiently and effectively in those segments 
the architecture of visual uptime select is intended to offer greater flexibility to fit the evolving needs of customers  resellers and network service providers 
there was no visual uptime select revenue during we have directed our visual ip insight development efforts at making the product more suitable for our internet service provider customers and at enabling the use of our product in higher margin broadband networks over  for example  cable lines and digital subscriber lines dsl 
we have also focused our efforts on training the cisco sales force and building our pipeline for the cisco product that is based on visual uptime  the cisco wide area performance management system cisco wapms that was announced during while we do not know when the downturn in the telecommunications industry will end  or how robust the recovery will be once or if it does begin  we continue to revisit our business plan as we seek to return to profitability 
there can be no assurance that our revenue will increase with the release of visual uptime select and our ongoing product development and sales initiatives  or that we will return to profitability 
subsequent to our earnings announcement on january   we revised our previously reported results of operations for the three months ended december  the change resulted from the establishment of a cumulative accrual of million related to unpaid sales tax liability related to through the impact on each individual year was insignificant 
as a result  the following changes to our results of operations for the three months ended december  are reported in this annual report on form k  as compared to the results reported in our january  earnings announcement  respectively general and administrative expenses increased from million to million  total operating expenses increased from million to million  net loss increased from million to million  and net loss per share increased from to per share 
in addition  the accrual resulted in the following changes to our results of operations for are reported in this annual report on form k  as compared to the results derived from our january  earnings announcement  respectively general and administrative expenses increased from million to million  total operating expenses increased from million to million  net loss increased from million to million  and net loss per share increased from to per share 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  
table of contents inventories  investments  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
among other things  these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies have resulted in judgments and estimates that are significant to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of hardware  the licensing of software and the provision of support and other services 
our revenue recognition policies follow the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which summarizes existing accounting literature and requires that four criteria be met prior to the recognition of revenue 
our accounting policies regarding revenue recognition are written to comply with the required criteria see note of notes to consolidated financial statements persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
the third and fourth criteria may require us to make significant judgments or estimates 
inventory because of the lead times required to obtain manufactured product  we must maintain sufficient quantities of inventory for all of our products to meet expected demand 
if actual demand is much lower than forecasted  we may not be able to dispose of our inventory at or above its cost 
we write down the value of estimated excess and obsolete inventory to the lower of cost or market value 
the estimates are based on historical trends  forecasts and specific customer or transaction information 
it is generally our policy to write down inventory based on the number of items that we expect to sell within a one year period 
if future demand is lower than currently estimated  additional write downs of our inventory may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we grant credit terms without collateral to our customers and  prior to  had not experienced any significant credit related losses 
during  we wrote off approximately million in accounts receivable from mci  following mci s bankruptcy filing  against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
during  we sold those mci receivables to an unrelated third party for approximately million 
accounts receivable include allowances to record receivables at their estimated net realizable value  which is determined based on estimates for doubtful accounts 
the estimates are based on historical information and specific review of outstanding receivables at the end of each reporting period 
if future events occur that negatively impact our customers  additional accounts receivable write downs may be required 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we utilize extensive product quality programs and processes including the active monitoring and evaluation of the quality of our component suppliers and contract manufacturers 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and services delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we account for and disclose our obligations for warranties in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires the accounting for and disclosure of guarantees and clarifies the requirements of fasb no 
 accounting for contingencies 

table of contents deferred tax valuation allowance as of december   we had recorded a valuation allowance of million against gross deferred tax assets of million 
we calculated the valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
positive evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight when assessing whether the level of future profitability needed to recognize the deferred assets will be achieved 
our cumulative loss in the most recent three year period represents sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance under the provisions of sfas no 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of any portion of the allowance 
accounting for stock options we account for stock options under the intrinsic value method  as defined in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees as interpreted by fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb no 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense is recorded for the excess  if any  of the market price of the stock at grant date or other measurement date over the amount that an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
apb no 
was superceded by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which defines a fair value based method of accounting for stock compensation 
sfas no 
allows an entity to continue to use the intrinsic value method to account for stock options and requires pro forma disclosures as if the fair value based method of accounting had been applied 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 
 which amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
accordingly  we adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
in the first quarter of results of operations the main items in our statements of operations are revenue 
our revenue consists of three types hardware  software  and support and services 
each of our products has components of each revenue type 
sales of visual uptime are primarily classified as hardware revenue 
we also sell licenses related to visual uptime that are classified as software revenue 
revenue related to the cisco wapms product are included in visual uptime revenue and are classified as software revenue 
there was no visual uptime select revenue in sales of visual ip insight are primarily classified as software revenue 
however  sales of our hardware product  the ip service element ise  which embeds certain visual ip insight agent functionality in a hardware device  are classified as hardware revenue 
sales of visual ewatcher and visual trinity  both discontinued products  were classified as software revenue 
sales of our visual ip insight subscription service  which we no longer offer to our customers  were classified as support and services revenue 
sales of the visual internet benchmark service  which was sold in  were classified as support and services revenue 
royalties from the visual internet benchmark service and the visual trinity product are classified as support and services revenue 
sales of celltracer are classified as hardware revenue 
sales of technical support  professional services and training for all of our products are classified as support and services revenue 
cost of revenue and gross profit 
cost of revenue consists of contract manufacturing costs  component parts  warehouse costs  direct compensation costs  warranty  other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees and other overhead expenses related to the manufacturing operations 
product cost of revenue includes both hardware and software cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
cost of revenue related to software sales has not been significant 
support and 
table of contents services cost of revenue includes outsourced benchmark services  professional services and technical support costs

table of contents the following table presents revenue attributable to customers that individually represented more than of our total revenue in thousands years ended december  at t sbc sprint interlink communications systems verizon mci all other customers each individually less than total revenue less than compared with revenue 
total revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
sales to all service providers increased from approximately of revenue in to in we expect a similar concentration of sales to service providers in hardware revenue 
hardware revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in demand for visual uptime and a corresponding decrease in revenue from at t  equant  mci  and verizon partially offset by increases in revenue from sprint  sbc and interlink communications systems 
we believe  in general  that this decrease in demand for visual uptime was primarily the result of increased competition  tighter inventory control at our service provider customers  the continued slowdown in demand for telecommunications products and services and reduced end user capital spending 
software revenue 
software revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
from to  visual ip insight license revenue decreased by million  reflecting the typical fluctuation in revenue from sales of that product due to the timing of sizable orders from a limited number of service providers  visual uptime license revenue decreased million primarily due to reduced sales of licenses to manage kentrox devices in  and license revenue from discontinued products decreased by million 
support and services revenue 
support and services revenue was million in and million in  a decrease of million 
support revenue decreased million primarily due to visual uptime and discontinued product technical support contracts that were not renewed 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in training and professional services of million due to increased demand for these services 
cost of revenue and gross profit 
total cost of revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
gross profit was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  primarily due to the reduction in revenue 
the gross profit margin was of revenue in compared to of revenue in the increase in total 
table of contents gross profit margin was primarily due to decreased fixed manufacturing and support operations costs resulting from ongoing cost reduction initiatives and the discontinuation of certain products 
product cost of revenue 
product cost of revenue  which includes both hardware and software cost of revenue  was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the gross profit margin attributable to products was and in and  respectively 
the slight decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to increased sales of our lower margin high speed visual uptime products and decreased higher margin software sales 
support and services cost of revenue 
support and services cost of revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the gross profit margin attributable to support and services was and in and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to decreased fixed costs  such as fees paid to third parties  to support discontinued products 
operating expenses 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million for compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to the full period effect of workforce reductions in and other cost cutting initiatives partially offset by additional costs incurred for the release of visual uptime select 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to the full period effect of workforce reductions in and other cost cutting initiatives partially offset by additional costs incurred for the release of visual uptime select 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to the full period effect of workforce reductions in and other cost cutting initiatives 
in addition  during  we sold the previously written off receivable related to the bankruptcy of mci to an unrelated third party for million and recorded the sale as a reduction to bad debt expense in general and administrative expense 
these reductions were partially offset by increased sales tax expense resulting from a cumulative unpaid sales tax liability of approximately million related to through the impact on each individual year was insignificant 
other income 
other income was million for  which consisted of a gain on the sale of a previously written off investment 
interest income expense  net 
interest expense  net  was million in compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to both cash and non cash interest expense related to the convertible debentures we issued in march see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
compared with revenue 
total revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
sales to all service providers increased from approximately of revenue in to in 
table of contents hardware revenue 
hardware revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in demand for visual uptime from at t  sprint and mci 
we believe  in general  that the decrease in demand for visual uptime was primarily the result of the overall downturn in the telecommunications industry  which was reflected in a slowdown in demand for telecommunications products and services and reduced spending 
more specifically  we believe that revenue from at t decreased due to tighter inventory control and revenue from sprint and mci decreased due to the loss of market share of these customers to their competitors coupled with our loss of business to our competitors 
we do not believe that the events at mci had a significant impact on our revenue from mci for the decrease was also due to decreased revenue from celltracer of million due to decreased demand from nai 
software revenue 
software revenue was million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase in software revenue was due primarily to an increase of million in licenses for visual uptime resulting from kentrox licenses  cisco licenses and other license upgrades for visual uptime 
in addition  even though total visual ip insight revenue decreased in  license revenue related to that product increased by million 
this increase is due to more license sales that replaced the sale of the visual ip insight subscription service in following the discontinuation of our subscription service 
since  we sell visual ip insight as a software license only 
prior to september   we offered both a subscription service and software licenses for that product 
these combined increases are offset by decreases in license revenue of million from visual trinity and visual ewatcher following the discontinuation of those products 
support and services revenue 
support and services revenue was million in and million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in support and services revenue was due primarily to decreased revenue from the visual trinity product  visual ewatcher product and visual internet benchmark service of million due to expired contracts that were not renewed as a result of the discontinuation of these products 
subscription fees for visual ip insight decreased by approximately million as customers have migrated to a perpetual license for that product 
the larger installed base of our visual uptime product for which we are selling technical support and the accelerated recognition of terminated technical support for celltracer as a result of the transfer of the source code to nai offsets these combined decreases 
cost of revenue and gross profit 
total cost of revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
gross profit was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
gross profit margin was of revenue in as compared to of revenue in the increase in gross profit margin percentage was due primarily to the overall high gross margin of our visual uptime and releases  decreased lower margin celltracer revenue  decreased fixed costs such as fees paid to third parties to provide the visual ip insight subscription service and visual internet benchmark service to customers for which we had existing contracts and overall decreased fixed costs in our manufacturing and support operations due to our cost reduction initiatives implemented since the fourth quarter of product cost of revenue

operating expenses 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million for compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in research and development expense was due primarily to the full period effect of workforce reductions and facility closures that occurred in and additional workforce reductions during sales and marketing expense

general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in general and administrative expense was due primarily to the full period effect of workforce reductions and facility closures that occurred in and additional workforce reductions during restructuring and impairment charges 
during the second quarter of  we reversed million of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of due primarily to lower than estimated costs related to facility closures 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the second quarter of that consisted primarily of severance and other termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately employees and lease costs and leasehold improvement write offs related to the closure of our new york facility following our announcement to discontinue the visual trinity product 
during the fourth quarter of  we reversed million of the restructuring charge recorded in the second quarter of due to lower than estimated costs related to facility closures and other contractual obligations 
we recorded another restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of that consisted of severance and other termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately people resulting from our continued focus on the reduction of our operating expenses see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
there were no restructuring or impairment charges in costs associated with the workforce reductions in of approximately employees have been charged to operating expenses as incurred

we also recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to the impairment of an investment acquired with the avesta acquisition and the write off of the remaining intangible assets related to the avesta acquisition as a result of our plans for the ewatcher product see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
we recorded million in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in related to the avesta acquisition 
all amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets were amortized or written off as of december  therefore  no amortization was recorded during interest income expense  net 
interest income  net  was million in compared to interest expense of million in the decrease of million was due primarily to both cash and non cash interest expense related to the convertible debentures we issued in march see note of notes to consolidated financial statements plus interest expense incurred on borrowings under our line of credit facility prior to payment and cancellation of the line offset by interest income on cash balances after the issuance of the convertible debentures 

table of contents income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for was million and related primarily to state income taxes and other non recoverable income tax payments

our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance was million compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
cash provided by operations was million in accounts receivable declined by million primarily due to the timing of a significant cash receipt in december this was offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and other cash used in operating activities of million 
we used million of cash to purchase equipment and other fixed assets 
cash provided by the reduction of our restricted short term investment see notes and was million and cash provided by the sale of common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan was million 
current assets exceeded current liabilities by approximately million as of december  future minimum payments  assuming no early payments  as of december  under the debentures and non cancelable operating leases are as follows in thousands debentures operating leases thereafter total minimum payments interest element of payments present value of future minimum payments unamortized debt discount total debentures we have a subtenant occupying a portion of our office space under a sublease that expires in december future minimum lease payments due from the sublessee are approximately million for the senior secured convertible debentures were issued in march in the aggregate amount of million in a private placement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the terms of these debentures provide for a number of events that could trigger the debenture holders right to force early repayment of of the outstanding principal plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the terms also include a financial target related to our financial performance 
because our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  less capital expenditures adjusted ebitda  as defined in the debentures  for was less than million  we did not meet the financial target and the 
table of contents debenture holders may at any time  and from time to time  require that we pay all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of their debenture holdings  plus accrued interest 
our adjusted ebitda for was a loss of million  as reconciled below 
the redemption of each debenture may be made in cash or common stock  at our option  provided certain conditions are satisfied  which we currently satisfy 
if we choose to issue common stock to repay the debt  our stockholders could be subject to significant dilution 
we are not providing the adjusted ebitda calculation below for purposes of evaluating our operating results 
management does not use adjusted ebitda as a measure of operating results 
we are including this calculation in our annual report on form k because we believe that it provides our investors and industry analysts with the reconciliation of our failure to meet the financial target contained in the debentures to consolidated financial information reported herein 
adjusted ebitda is not a recognized term under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or cash flow provided by used in operating activities determined in accordance with gaap 
because adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  it may not be comparable to ebitda  or other similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the following table sets forth i the calculation of adjusted ebitda for and ii a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net cash provided by operating activities for in thousands net loss  as reported interest expense depreciation and amortization capital expenditures adjusted ebitda cash interest expense capital expenditures changes in assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities upon the filing of this annual report on form k  the debenture holders have the right to require payment of the debentures  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time 
provided that we meet certain criteria specified in the debentures  which we meet as of the date of this annual report on form k  we may determine in our sole discretion whether to pay each requested payment in stock or in cash 
should we receive any payment requests  we intend to carefully evaluate and balance liquidity concerns with dilution considerations and make each determination on a case by case basis 
if we choose to pay a debenture holder with shares of our common stock and the per share issuance price of the stock is less than  the conversion price of any outstanding debentures would be adjusted downward to the issuance price of such stock 
in addition  under the terms of the warrants held by the debenture holders  an issuance of shares below the exercise price of the warrants would cause the exercise price and the number of shares issuable under the warrants to be adjusted on a weighted average basis 
based upon our current revenue and expense expectations  we believe that we would have sufficient operating capital for at least the next twelve months in the event we paid all of the debentures in cash 

table of contents the following table outlines the number of shares into which the debentures would be convertible if we issue additional equity including for payment of the debentures at prices specified  as well as the total percent of the outstanding shares of the company that such shares would represent upon conversion  calculated using the number of shares outstanding as of march decline issuance price debenture shares of company no anti dilution the warrants are subject to weighted average anti dilution protection which would decrease the exercise price and increase the number of shares issuable under the warrants 
these changes would be determined once the total investment amount and price per share of any future equity issuance were known 
in january  we received a non binding letter of intent for a million line of credit from silicon valley bank svb and we are currently in the final phase of negotiations for the line of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit would only be available for working capital purposes once the legal documentation is complete and our debentures have been repaid see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  svb had issued a million standby letter of credit  as amended  in favor of our contract manufacturer  celestica  that expires on september  the letter of credit  secured by the pledge of a certificate of deposit in the amount of million that matures on july   was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
subsequent to december   the letter of credit and corresponding certificate of deposit were reduced from million to million in exchange for payment terms of ten days 
the million reduction in the certificate of deposit will be a source of cash in the first quarter of as described elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we are involved in two separate lawsuits in which we are litigating i claims by a competitor that our products infringe the patents held by that competitor  ii our claims that that competitor s products infringe patents held by us  and iii an unfair competition claim 
despite our belief that our claims are correct and that our position will ultimately be vindicated  the conduct of this litigation may be expensive and may divert our limited resources from other more productive activities  resulting in adverse effects on our business and results of operations 
at this point in the litigation  the likelihood of any outcome cannot be determined and the adverse effect of any finding cannot be estimated 
we have commitments related to inventory purchased by certain suppliers on our behalf 
if such inventory is not used within a specified period of time or we discontinue a product for which the suppliers have made purchases or we terminate a relationship with the supplier for which we have set minimum inventory requirements  we are required to purchase the excess inventory from the suppliers 
additionally  if we cancel a purchase order placed on a supplier  we may be subject to certain costs and fees 
because of the nature of this obligation  we are unable to estimate the potential liability associated with the commitment to purchase excess inventory as of december   if any 
we do not engage in any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in particular  we do not have any so called limited purpose entities  which include special purpose entities and structured finance entities 
we require substantial working capital to fund our business  particularly to finance inventories  accounts receivable  research and development activities  operating expenses and capital expenditures 
to date  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily with the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in february  cash provided by operating activities  bank borrowings  and the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debentures 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the payment of the debentures  the rate of future revenue growth  if any  the acceptance of our new visual uptime select product suite by our service providers  systems integrators and vars  as well as our gross profits and our levels of operating expenses  including product research and development  sales and marketing and general and 
table of contents administrative expenses 
if cash provided by currently available sources is not sufficient  we will be required to further reduce our expenditures for operations or to seek additional capital through other means that may include additional borrowings  the sale of equity securities or the sale of assets 
furthermore  our ongoing negotiations with svb may be unsuccessful in establishing a line of credit 
under those circumstances  there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available  or available on terms that are reasonable or acceptable to us  and our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
risk factors investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
in addition to the other information contained in this annual report  including the reports we incorporate by reference  you should consider the following factors before investing in our securities 
our debenture holders now have the right to demand payment of any or all of our debentures at any time and from time to time 
because our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  less capital expenditures  for was less than million  our debenture holders may require that we pay any or all of the outstanding principal amount of their debentures plus accrued interest at any time and from time to time 
under the terms of the debentures i a debenture holder electing payment for some portion of the debentures must notify us of this election  ii we  in turn  must notify the debenture holder of the manner in which we intend to pay that debenture holder either all cash or all common stock  and iii the notifying debenture holder then notifies us of the amount to be paid in that form at that time 
the choice of whether to pay all common stock or all cash is in our absolute discretion provided we meet certain criteria specified in the debentures which we currently meet 
if we choose to pay any such demand with common stock  and the issue price of such shares is below the then current conversion price of the debentures  the conversion price of the debentures is immediately reset to such lower price and the exercise price of the warrants and the number of shares issuable upon exercise would be adjusted on a weighted average basis 
if we choose to pay any such demand with cash  and we do not have sufficient cash to both pay amounts and to fund ongoing operations  we may be required to seek additional capital through a sale of assets  sale of additional securities or through additional borrowings  none of which may be available on terms acceptable to us 
we may not successfully conclude our negotiations to establish a line of credit  and we may not be able to successfully generate sufficient working capital or borrow it on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our ongoing negotiations with silicon valley bank may be unsuccessful in establishing a line of credit 
the debenture holders may now require us to prepay the debentures and we may choose to do so in cash 
if we do repay all or a portion of the debentures in cash  our operating capital will be greatly reduced and may be further reduced if we fail to generate positive cash flow from operations 
if we have insufficient operating capital to fund ongoing operations  we may be required to find external sources of operating capital through loans or issuance of securities  neither of which may be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the ongoing patent litigation between us and paradyne  and any other potential intellectual property litigation  could have a significant detrimental effect on our business 
despite our belief that our products do not infringe paradyne s patents and that paradyne s claims are frivolous and without merit  the conduct of the current litigation in florida and maryland may be expensive and may divert our limited resources from other more productive activities  resulting in adverse effects on our business and results of operations 
at this point in the litigation  the likelihood of any outcome cannot be determined and the adverse effect of any finding cannot be estimated 

table of contents additionally  if others claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights  whether the claims are valid or not  we may be forced to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  delay product shipments  re engineer our products or acquire licenses to the claimant s intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
we expect that these claims may become more common as the number of products in the network management industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps 
if a claimant is successful in a lawsuit arising from such a claim  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
adverse publicity related to any intellectual property litigation also could harm i the sale of our products and damage our competitive position  ii the market for our common stock  and iii our ability to obtain additional capital  lines of credit or other borrowings on terms acceptable to us 
we may experience difficulties in convincing our customers to adopt the new visual uptime select product line 
our new product line  visual uptime select  is based on a new licensing model and includes significant new technological innovations 
as with any major change in the way a company does business  we have sales and technical obstacles to overcome related to upgrading current visual uptime customers to the new visual uptime select product line 
these obstacles may delay new orders  slow deployment of our products by our customers or result in other unforeseen challenges that otherwise negatively impact us 
substantial dilution to our common stockholders could result if we are required to raise additional capital through the sale of equity at less than per share 
our debentures for million currently are convertible into  shares of our common stock at the rate of per share and the associated warrants are exercisable for  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the debentures contain full ratchet anti dilution price protection 
this means that if we issue additional shares of common stock in connection with a financing or under other circumstances at a price lower than per share  the debentures would become convertible into a greater number of shares of common stock than they are today 
issuances of common stock that do not trigger this anti dilution protection include issuances as part of an acquisition or strategic investment  issuances under our stock incentive plan or employee stock purchase plan  issuances or issuances as part of a public offering of more than million 
the following table outlines the number of shares into which the debentures would be convertible if we issue additional equity including for payment of the debentures at prices specified  as well as the total percent of the outstanding shares of the company that such shares would represent upon conversion  calculated using the number of shares outstanding as of march decline issuance price debenture shares of company no anti dilution the warrants are subject to weighted average anti dilution protection which would decrease the exercise price and increase the number of shares issuable under the warrants 
these changes would be determined once the total investment amount and price per share of any future equity issuance were known 

table of contents we have an accumulated deficit of million 
our operating losses since plus the effects of impairment and restructuring charges  amortization of intangible assets and the write off of in process research and development have resulted in an accumulated deficit of million as of december  as a result  we could be unable to raise equity financing  to arrange bank financing or to arrange credit from suppliers on reasonable or acceptable terms 
we may not be profitable in the future 
our ability to generate operating income in the future is  in large part  dependent on our success in growing revenue and managing operating expenses 
research and development expense  sales and marketing expense and general administrative expense decreased from million in to million in however  revenue declined from million in to million in market conditions  competitive pressures  and other factors beyond our control  may adversely affect our ability to adequately sustain revenue in the future 
in particular  our ability to sustain revenue may be negatively affected by our dependence on our service provider customers 
pressure on capital expenditures and the decline of the telecommunications industry may delay the roll out of new services based on our products offered by our service provider customers 
any potential reduction in demand for value added services or products  which our products support  from the service providers customers  directly impacts the purchase volume of our products and may impact our ability to sustain revenue 
we believe that we have reduced operating expenses to a sufficient level such that when combined with our anticipated revenue  we will become profitable in the second half of in the event that our projections are not correct  we may be required to further reduce our cost structure 
because our operating expenses include substantial fixed costs  which cannot be reduced quickly  if revenue levels are below expectations  operating results are likely to be materially and adversely affected because we may not be able to reduce operating expenses in sufficient time to compensate for the reduction in revenue 
we are highly dependent on sales to telecommunications companies 
our primary sales and marketing strategy depends predominantly on sales to telecommunications service providers 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenue in will be attributable to sales of visual uptime through april  visual uptime select and visual ip insight to service providers 
the loss of any one of our service provider customers  which together have historically provided a majority of our revenue  could result in a substantial loss of revenue that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
revenue related to our shipment of products to service providers represented  and of our consolidated revenue for  and  respectively 
this concentration should continue because our customer base consists predominantly of service providers 
existing service provider customers are not easily replaced because of the relatively few participants in that market 
high barriers to entry due to extraordinary capital requirements and the increased possibility that existing service providers may merge or fail because of the current downturn in the telecommunications industry  may further reduce their number and make replacing a significant network service provider customer very difficult in the future 
furthermore  the small number of network service providers means that the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders or a delay in shipment of our products to any one service provider customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue for a quarter 
our anticipated dependence on sizable orders from a limited number of service provider customers will make the relationship between us and each service provider critically important to our business 
further  because none of our agreements contain minimum purchase requirements  there can be no assurance that the issuance of a purchase order will result in significant recurring business 
with the introduction of visual uptime select  we anticipate that we will see growth in revenue from our value added resellers as we present a more cost competitive solution for them to sell 
there can be no assurance that such growth will occur 

table of contents our long sales cycle  which has had a median length of approximately five to six months  requires us to expend significant resources on potential sales opportunities that may never be consummated 
because of the delays inherent in large enterprises  our target end user market  making significant capital expenditures on complicated systems  our sales cycles are relatively long 
for enterprise customers  our historical sales cycle has a median of approximately five to six months 
this extended cycle further increases the risk that a potential customer might suffer a reduction in their capital budgets or a change in their desired functionality during the sales process 
because we are required to commit substantial sales and marketing resources during this extended time period without any assurance of consummating an eventual sale  we risk incurring significant expenses without generating any associated revenue 
failure to adapt to rapid technological change could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid changes  including continuing advances in technology  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and preferences and changes in industry standards 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in a timely fashion that accommodate future changes  we will likely lose customers and business which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the introduction of new technologies  advances in techniques for network services  the integration of service level management functionality into other network hardware components and improvements to the infrastructure of the internet could render our products obsolete or unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that i there will continue to be a need for our products  ii our existing products will continue to compete successfully  iii our future product offerings will keep pace with the technological changes implemented by our competitors  iv our products will satisfy evolving industry standards or preferences of existing or prospective customers  or v we will be successful in developing and marketing products for any future technology 
we face growing competition from several market segments that could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers 
we face competition from several market segments whose functionality our products integrate 
we expect competition in each of these market segments to intensify in the future 
our primary current competitors include  or in the future may include  the following brix  kentrox  paradyne  adtran  packeteer  netscout  lucent technologies and concord 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services that they offer 
while we intend to compete by offering superior features  performance  reliability and flexibility at competitive prices and on the strength of our relationships with service providers  many of these competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us  and some have well established relationships with our current and potential customers 
as a result  these competitors may be able to respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more effectively than us  or devote greater resources than us to the development  promotion and sale of products 
in addition  we believe that competitors from one or more of our market segments could partner with each other to offer products that supply functionality approaching that provided by visual uptime select 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profitability and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents errors in our products or services could discourage customers and damage our reputation 
products and services as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products and services until commercial shipments have commenced 
such errors can substantially delay the time until we are able to generate revenue from new product releases and could force us to divert additional development resources to correct the errors 
if such errors are detected after shipments have been made  then our reputation may be damaged  and we may incur substantial costs covering warranty claims 
in our research and development spending plan  we allocate twenty percent of the engineering budget for sustaining issues 
sustaining issues include fixing problems in released products that were not identified in the development and testing cycle 
if during a given period  problems are found that cause the allocation of more than twenty percent of our resources to fixing these problems  then the next round of product feature releases can be delayed by this diversion of resources 
we have anti takeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 
terms of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws make it more difficult for another individual or company to acquire control of our company  even if a change of control would benefit our stockholders 
these terms include our board of directors  without stockholder approval  may issue up to  shares of preferred stock on terms that they determine 
this preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms that delay or prevent the change in control of our company  make removal of management more difficult or depress the price of our stock  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law which prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner  our board of directors is staggered so that only a portion of its members are elected each year  only our board of directors  our chairman of the board  our president  or stockholders holding a majority of our stock can call special stockholder meetings  and special procedures must be followed in order for stockholders to present proposals at stockholder meetings 
in addition  the debentures may become immediately due and payable upon a change of control  which could have the effect of discouraging an acquisition that might otherwise benefit our stockholders 
an unanticipated interruption or delay in the scheduled receipt of products from our contract manufacturers could reduce revenue 
we have outsourced the manufacture of our ase units  the analysis service element of our visual uptime select platform  to two contract manufacturing firms 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of these units 
our ability to meet the delivery dates requested by customers 
table of contents depends on the timely supply of products by the contract manufacturers 
a decision by a contract manufacturer to reduce or eliminate the amount of credit extended to us or to stop the shipment of products due to concerns about our financial condition or the amount of their credit and inventory risk could delay delivery of product to our customers and cause a delay in our revenue 
if we are required to establish alternative contract manufacturers  there can be no assurances that we would be able to do so  or to do so on terms acceptable to us 
furthermore  if we were required to replace our current contract manufacturers  we could face substantial production delays and could be required to pay substantially higher prices in order to complete delivery of our customers orders 
such a delay or price increase could substantially damage our ability to generate sufficient revenues and achieve profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk during  we issued long term debt in the form of the convertible debentures discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the convertible debentures bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 
we are also exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
our investment policy restricts us to investing only in investment grade securities 
a failure of these investment securities to perform at their historical levels could reduce the interest income realized by us 
while substantially all of our product sales to date have been made to customers in the united states  we plan to sell our products to international customers at prices denominated in united states dollars 
however  if we commence selling material volumes of product to such customers at prices not denominated in united states dollars  we intend to adopt a strategy to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency
