item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  customer payments related to these contracts are generally placed in trust funds and invested or are used to purchase insurance policies to cover the cost of the future delivery of products and services 
when the service or merchandise is delivered  we realize the full contract amount plus all accumulated trust earnings associated with that contract or the buildup in the face value of the insurance contract  generally offsetting increases in our costs due to inflation 
we estimate that as of october   the future value of our preneed backlog including estimated earnings on funds held in trust and build up in the face value of third party insurance contracts  in each case using projected returns represented approximately billion of revenue to be recognized in the future as these prepaid products and services are delivered  calculated as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in item trust funds and escrow accounts

management 
we have an experienced management team  many of whom joined us through acquisitions 
our management structure is designed to allow local funeral home directors and cemetery managers substantial flexibility in deciding how their businesses will be managed and how their products and services will be priced and merchandised 
at the same time  financial and strategic goals are established by management at the corporate level 
we provide business support services primarily through our shared services center  which opened in and provides centralized and standardized accounting  management reporting  payroll  contract processing  accounts receivable collection and other services for all of our facilities 
in december  we announced plans to restructure certain management functions and reduce our employee headcount by approximately employees throughout the organization as discussed above 
currently  we are divided into four operating divisions in the united states  each of which is managed by a division president and chief financial officer 
these divisions are further divided into regions  each of which is managed by an area vice president 
we also have a corporate division  which manages our corporate services  accounting  financial operations and strategic planning 
early in fiscal year  we formed a sales and marketing division to centralize responsibility for sales teams in all operating divisions and to allow for more comprehensive training and sharing of information 
from time to time  we may increase  reduce or realign our divisions and regions

foreign operations 
in fiscal year  we began to sell our foreign operations as part of our strategy to reduce debt and focus on our core businesses 
during fiscal year  we sold our mexican  australian  new zealand  belgian and dutch operations comprised of funeral homes and cemeteries 
during fiscal year  we sold our remaining foreign operations located in spain  portugal  france  canada and argentina  which consisted of funeral homes and cemeteries 
financial information about industry and geographic segments 
for financial information about our industry and geographic segments for fiscal years  and  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item competition our funeral home and cemetery operations generally face intense competition in local markets that typically are served by numerous funeral home and cemetery firms 
we also compete with monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and crematories  and other non traditional providers of limited services or products 
market share is largely a function of goodwill  family heritage and tradition  although competitive pricing  professional service and attractive  well maintained and conveniently located facilities are also important 
because of the significant role of goodwill and tradition  market share increases are usually gained over a long period of time 
extensive marketing through media advertising  direct mailings and personal sales calls has increased in recent years  especially with respect to the sales of preneed funeral services 
information about our sales and marketing approach can be found above under the heading business strategy 
traditional cemetery and funeral service operators face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the united states 
additional information about the trend towards cremation and our strategies to address that trend can be found under the headings the death care industry  competitive strengths and business strategy 
regulation our funeral home operations are regulated by the federal trade commission the ftc under the ftc s trade regulation rule on funeral industry practices  cfr part the funeral rule  which went into effect on april   and was revised effective july  the ftc is reviewing the funeral rule and has conducted hearings to receive input from industry and consumer groups 
at this time  the ftc has not issued any proposed changes to the regulation 
the funeral rule defines certain acts or practices as unfair or deceptive and contains certain requirements to prevent these acts or practices 
the preventive measures require a funeral provider to give consumers accurate  itemized price information and various other disclosures about funeral goods and services and prohibit a funeral provider from misrepresenting legal  crematory and cemetery requirements  embalming for a fee without permission  requiring the purchase of a casket for direct cremation  and requiring consumers to buy certain funeral goods or services as a condition for furnishing other funeral goods or services 
our operations are also subject to extensive regulation  supervision and licensing under numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations 
for example  state laws impose licensing requirements for funeral homes and funeral directors and regulate preneed sales 
our embalming facilities are subject to stringent environmental and health regulations 
we have a department that monitors compliance  and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the funeral rule and all such laws and regulations 
federal  state and local legislative bodies and regulatory agencies frequently propose new laws and regulations  some of which could have a material effect on our operations and on the death care industry in general 
we cannot predict the outcome of any proposed legislation or regulation or the effect that any such legislation or regulation might have on us 
employees we currently employ approximately  persons  and we believe that we maintain a good relationship with our employees 
approximately of our employees are represented by labor unions or collective bargaining units 
in december  we announced a reduction and restructuring of our workforce  which reduced the number of our employees by approximately additional information about our restructuring and workforce reduction can be found under the heading business strategy 
item properties as of october   approximately percent of our funeral home locations were owned by our subsidiaries  and approximately percent were held under operating leases 
the leased properties have terms ranging from to years  except for six leases that expire between and generally  we have a right of first refusal and an option to purchase the leased premises 
an aggregate of million of our term notes are secured by mortgages on some of our funeral homes  these notes were either assumed by us upon our acquisition of the property or represent seller financing for the acquired property 
as of october   we owned cemeteries covering a total of approximately  acres 
approximately percent of the total acreage is available for future development 
our corporate headquarters occupy approximately  square feet of leased office space in a building in suburban new orleans 
in addition  we own a  square foot building in suburban new orleans that we use for our shared services center  human resources  communications  internal audit and information systems departments 
as of october   we had sold all of our foreign operations

while the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we carry insurance with coverages and coverage limits that we believe to be appropriate for our business 
although we give no assurance that this insurance is sufficient to protect us against all contingencies  we believe that our insurance protection is reasonable in view of the nature and scope of our operations

factors that we expect to impact our results in fiscal year and that we believe are reasonably likely to cause variances from our fiscal year results are discussed in the section entitled forward looking statements in item other factors not currently anticipated by us could also cause future results to vary materially from past performance 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred million in noncash impairment charges  which consisted of a goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax  or 
per share and an impairment charge related to certain long lived assets of million million after tax  or 
per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item in the third quarter of  we incurred an million million after tax  or 
per share charge related to the redemption of our remarketing or redeemable securities roars 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item in the third quarter of  primarily as a result of the significant devaluation of the argentine peso and the depressed economic conditions in argentina  we re evaluated the expected loss on the disposition of assets held for sale  and we incurred a noncash charge of million million after tax  or 
per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item in the third quarter of  we incurred a noncash charge of million million after tax  or per share primarily related to the writedown of assets held for sale to their estimated fair values 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item during the third quarter of fiscal year  we incurred a charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt in connection with our debt refinancing that occurred in june see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item the pro forma data presented for fiscal years and are reported as if the change in accounting principles had occurred at the beginning of each of those years 
during fiscal year  we sold our operations in spain  portugal  france  canada and argentina  which consisted of funeral homes and cemeteries 
as of october   the sale of all of our foreign operations had been completed 
this resulted in a decrease in assets  the number of funerals and interments performed and the backlog 
we used the proceeds from the sales along with cash flow to reduce our long term debt 
as of october   assets increased and shareholders equity decreased as compared to october  due in part to the change in accounting principles and the writedown of assets held for sale to their estimated fair values 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
offsetting the increase to assets from the change in accounting principles was the sale of our operations in mexico  australia  new zealand  belgium and the netherlands  which consisted of funeral homes and cemeteries 
we used these proceeds  along with cash flow and the proceeds from the sale of some domestic assets  to reduce our long term debt 
the october  long term debt  less current maturities balance excludes million of debt associated with assets held for sale 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of fiscal year we are the third largest provider of funeral and cemetery products and services in the death care industry in the united states 
as of january   we owned and operated funeral homes and cemeteries in states within the united states and puerto rico 
we sell cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis 
our revenues in each period are derived primarily from at need sales  preneed sales delivered out of our backlog during the period including the accumulated trust fund earnings or build up in the face value of insurance contracts related to these preneed deliveries  preneed cemetery property sales and other items such as perpetual care trust earnings and finance charges 
historically  our growth has been primarily from acquisitions 
this trend began to change in late fiscal year as industry conditions reduced the number of major consolidators participating in the acquisition market  those that remained generally applied significantly tighter pricing criteria  and many potential sellers withdrew their businesses from the market rather than pursue transactions at lower prices 
as the business model shifted  death care consolidators experienced diminishing access to capital 
in response to these changes  we ceased our acquisition activity and developed strategies for improving cash flow and reducing and restructuring debt 
during the past four years  we have focused on debt reduction and cash flow 
during fiscal year  after having substantially achieved our financial goals  we began positioning ourselves for business expansion in fiscal year after the end of the first fiscal quarter of  we reported that several external factors were adversely affecting us and our industry 
decreased deaths and intense price competition in many of our markets contributed to a decrease in events at our funeral homes and cemeteries 
continued low levels of consumer confidence in the national economy created a difficult preneed sales environment 
depressed stock prices and returns on fixed income investments continued to put pressure on our trust earnings 
based on these factors  we revised our performance outlook downward for fiscal year while we believe that most of the external factors adversely impacting our business are temporary  these factors have continued to impact our at need results  preneed sales  trust portfolio performance and growth strategies 
during  we continued to experience a decline in the number of at need services performed by our businesses 
we track our at need sales by market and regularly compare our performance with data from a variety of sources to gauge changes in market share 
the data from these sources indicate to us that approximately percent of the decline in the number of funeral services performed by our operations during the year resulted from a decline in the number of deaths in our markets  and approximately percent of the decline was due to a loss in market share 
see year ended october  compared to year ended october  funeral segment for further discussion 
we expect to eventually see more normalized mortality trends in our markets  and we expect our at need results to improve when that occurs 
we believe that low levels of consumer confidence can negatively affect preneed sales 
the consumer confidence index reached year lows in february and march of the index improved in april of and remained at that level during most of our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
we remain cautiously optimistic as we monitor this index and its effect on our preneed sales organization 
the equity markets were weaker in the early part of our fiscal year  but since may  have begun to improve 
the dow jones industrial average is up approximately percent this calendar year through early december  and in the same time period  our trust portfolio  including unrealized gains and losses  increased approximately percent 
because approximately percent of our total trust portfolio is currently invested in a diversified group of equity securities  we would generally expect our portfolio performance to improve as the performance of the overall stock market improves 
as we await further improvements in the economy  financial markets and normalized mortality trends  we will remain focused on improving operational performance and generating cash 
in that regard  in september we announced a set of new operating initiatives  which have resulted in the creation of four task forces to address the following key areas growth in the number of funeral events performed  increased cemetery property sales volume  cost improvements and employee development initiatives 
for further discussions of these initiatives  see business strategy included in item as part of our cost reduction initiatives  in december we announced plans to restructure and reduce our workforce 
this and other cost saving directives are expected to reduce costs and increase cash flow in fiscal year and beyond  and lead to increased earnings per share 
we will record a charge in the first quarter of fiscal year for severance and other costs associated with the workforce reductions in the range of million to million million to million after tax  or 
per share 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we identified a number of small businesses to close or sell  most of which were acquired as part of a group of facilities  that are performing below acceptable levels or no longer fit our operating profile 
as a result  we recorded a million impairment charge 
collectively  these businesses generated revenue of approximately million and very little gross profit during fiscal year we believe that the closing or sale of these businesses will enable management to focus on our most productive operations where our operating initiatives have the potential to bring about the greatest benefits in increased earnings and cash flow 
we plan to continue to evaluate our options for deployment of cash flow as opportunities arise 
in june  we announced that our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program that will allow us to invest up to million in repurchases of our class a common stock 
as of january   we had repurchased  shares of our class a common stock at an average price of per share 
at current stock prices  we believe stock repurchases and debt reduction continue to be more attractive uses of our cash flow than other alternatives such as acquisitions and new business development 
however  we will continue to consider acquiring high quality cemeteries and funeral homes that are priced within our guidelines and that fit our new business model  opening new funeral homes on cemetery properties we own or entering into agreements to construct funeral homes in third party cemeteries 
for fiscal year  we recorded a net loss of million  or 
per share 
the loss resulted primarily from a number of charges incurred in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million million after tax  or 
per share related to the redemption of our remarketable or redeemable securities  a charge to corporate general and administrative expenses of million million after tax  or 
per share for separation pay to former officers  a noncash impairment of certain long lived assets of million million after tax  or 
per share  resulting from our decision to close or sell a number of small businesses and a noncash impairment of goodwill of million million after tax  or 
per share related to our cemetery segment 
our earnings were also negatively affected by a decline in the number of funeral services performed  a decline in cemetery merchandise deliveries and a reduction in trust earnings 
for additional information about the effect these factors had on our earnings during fiscal year  see the discussion under the heading results of operations below 
for a discussion of our forecasts for continuing operations in fiscal year and the principal assumptions underlying the forecasts  see the discussion under the heading forward looking statements below 
preneed sales general our funeral and cemetery businesses include prearranged sales funded through trust and escrow arrangements 
the cemetery business includes maintenance of cemetery grounds funded through perpetual care trust funds 
we defer all of the earnings realized by our preneed funeral and preneed cemetery merchandise trust funds and escrow accounts until the underlying merchandise or services are delivered 
we recognize the earnings from our perpetual care trust funds as they are realized in the trust 
from through  we achieved an overall annual realized return of percent to percent in our trust funds 
however  the average realized return on our domestic trust funds was percent  percent  percent and percent for fiscal years   and  respectively 
these returns represent interest  dividends and realized capital gains or losses but not unrealized capital gains or losses 
we defer recognition of all earnings and losses realized by preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise trust funds until the underlying products and services are delivered 
consequently  the lower investment returns realized reduced the trust earnings recognized as revenue in and may do so again in fiscal year we recognize all earnings and losses realized by our perpetual care trust funds currently including capital gains and losses in those jurisdictions where capital gains can be withdrawn and used for cemetery maintenance 
as a result  depressed stock prices and returns on fixed income investments put pressure on perpetual care trust earnings recognized in fiscal year and may do so again in fiscal year because approximately percent of our total trust portfolio is currently invested in a diversified group of equity securities  we would generally expect our portfolio performance to follow the overall stock market performance 
for a discussion of the valuation allowance related to prearranged receivables  see note d to the consolidated financial statements included in item and overview of critical accounting policies valuation of long lived assets 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  our preneed funeral and preneed cemetery merchandise trust funds and escrow accounts had net unrealized depreciation of million and million  respectively  as of october  unrealized gains and losses in the funeral trust funds and cemetery merchandise trust funds have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow  unless the fair market value of the funds were to decline below the estimated costs to deliver the underlying products and services 
if that were to occur  we would record a charge to earnings to record a liability for the expected loss on the delivery of the contract 
over time  gains and losses realized in the funds are allocated to underlying preneed contracts and affect the amount of trust fund earnings we record when we deliver the underlying product or service 
accordingly  if current market conditions do not improve  our revenues  margins  earnings and cash flow would be negatively affected by the reduced revenue we would realize when we deliver the underlying products and services 
as described in the preceding paragraph  this negatively impacted our results for and may do so again in we project that with approximately percent to percent annualized returns in the funds over the estimated lives of the associated preneed contracts  we would recover the net unrealized depreciation currently in the funds by the time the underlying products and services are delivered 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  our perpetual care trust fund accounts had net unrealized depreciation of million as of october  unrealized gains and losses in the perpetual care trust funds do not affect earnings but could limit the capital gains available to us and could result in lower returns and lower current revenues than we have historically achieved 
we estimate that as of october  the future value of our preneed backlog represented approximately billion of revenue to be recognized in the future as these prepaid products and services are delivered 
this represents the face value of the backlog plus the earnings that are projected on the funds held in trust and a build up in the face value of insurance contracts 
it assumes no future preneed sales and assumes maturities each year consistent with our experience  with the majority of existing contracts maturing over the next years 
as of october   the value of the preneed backlog  excluding any future earnings on the funds held in trust and any build up in the face value of insurance contracts  but including earnings and losses realized to date on the funds held in trust  was approximately billion 
we believe that one of the primary drivers of sustainable long term growth in the number of families served by our funeral homes and cemeteries are preneed funeral and cemetery property sales 
preneed property  products and services are typically sold on an installment basis with terms of approximately three to five years 
in fiscal year  we changed the terms and conditions of our preneed sales contracts and commissions in order to enhance our cash flow 
this resulted in an anticipated reduction in preneed sales  including preneed cemetery property sales 
we modified our preneed payment plans early in fiscal year by increasing finance charges  requiring larger down payments and shortening installment payment terms 
effective the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we also substantially reduced the commissions paid on sales of preneed cemetery services and preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise  which we believe had the largest impact on preneed sales 
although we reduced or eliminated commissions available to preneed sales counselors on certain sales  we now provide a minimum compensation guarantee 
the change in commission structure provides an incentive to preneed sales counselors to focus on selling preneed cemetery property and preneed funeral services 
we believe that these are the sales that build and maintain market share 
in addition  the change better aligned operations with changes in accounting necessitated by the adoption of sab no 
because  after the implementation of sab no 
 preneed cemetery property sales are the only preneed sales that we recognize on a current basis after collection of percent of the sales price 
we also believe that these changes have improved the quality of preneed sales and receivables 
with respect to the sale of cemetery property  whether preneed or at need  we are generally required by state law to place into a perpetual care trust  a portion  usually percent  of the proceeds we receive in order to fund maintenance of the cemetery grounds 
as payments are received  we generally fund the perpetual care trust in the same proportion as the payment bears to the contract amount  for example  if we receive percent of the contract price  we place in trust percent of the total amount to be placed in trust for that contract 
we withdraw realized earnings  including net realized capital gains in some jurisdictions  on these funds to use towards the maintenance of our cemeteries  but principal must generally be held in the trust in perpetuity 
with respect to the preneed sale of cemetery and funeral products and services  state laws generally require either a portion of the installment payments received be placed into a trust fund or the use of an insurance policy underwritten by an insurance company to provide funds to cover the costs of delivering funeral products and services in the future 
with respect to the preneed sale of cemetery merchandise  we are generally required to place in trust percent to percent of each installment received 
with respect to the preneed sale of funeral and cemetery services  we are generally required to place in trust percent to percent of each installment received 
the sale of caskets is treated in some jurisdictions in the same manner as the sale of cemetery merchandise and in some jurisdictions in the same manner as the sale of funeral services for these purposes 
when insurance is used  we apply customer payments to pay premiums on the insurance policies 
we typically act as agent for the insurance company and earn a commission 
generally  we can withdraw the principal of and earnings on the funds placed in trust only at the time that the related products and services are delivered

we sell prearranged funeral services and preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise under contracts that provide for delivery of the services and merchandise at the time of death 
revenue from preneed sales of services and merchandise is deferred until the period in which the service is performed and the merchandise is delivered 
on the balance sheet  the full contract amount is included in prearranged deferred revenue  net liability 
the corresponding receivable due from the customer is reflected in prearranged receivables  net asset  and the corresponding cash received from the customer is reflected part in prearranged receivables for the portion placed in trust and part in cash for the portion we are allowed to retain 
the costs to acquire the sales  primarily commissions and other direct costs  are reflected on the balance sheet as deferred charges asset and are charged to expense as the services are performed and products delivered 
indirect costs of marketing preneed services and merchandise are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
as the customer makes payments on the preneed contract  the portion of prearranged receivables representing the receivable due from the customer declines  and the portion representing the receivable from the trust increases 
we record cash for the amount of cash received that is not required to be placed in trust 
realized earnings on the amounts held in trust represent a debit to prearranged receivables asset and a credit to prearranged deferred revenue liability and are not recognized as revenue until delivery of the service or merchandise 
when the service or merchandise is delivered  we recognize as revenue the full contract amount plus all trust earnings associated with that contract  with a corresponding reduction recorded to prearranged deferred revenue liability 
we debit cash with the amount removed from trust that is attributable to the contract consisting of the customer s payments and related realized earnings  all of which is withdrawn at that time and record a corresponding reduction in prearranged receivables asset 
associated deferred charges asset are expensed  and the actual expenses incurred in delivering the services and merchandise are recognized 
additional information about our prearranged receivables and prearranged deferred revenue is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for preneed sales of interment rights cemetery property  the associated revenue and all costs to acquire the sale are recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
under sfas no 
 recognition of revenue and costs must be deferred until percent of the property sales price has been collected 
a portion  generally percent  of the sale proceeds are placed into perpetual care trust funds 
we withdraw and recognize realized earnings from these funds on a monthly basis to offset the cost of maintaining our cemetery grounds 
the perpetual care trust funds are not reflected on the financial statements because principal must remain in the trust in perpetuity 
some of our sales of preneed property  products and services are made under installment contracts bearing interest at prevailing rates 
finance charges are recognized as revenue under the effective interest method over the terms of the related installment receivables 
commissions and other direct costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new prearranged services and prearranged merchandise sales are deferred and amortized as the contracts are delivered in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for insurance companies 
indirect costs of marketing prearranged services are expensed in the period in which incurred 
all direct costs to acquire the sales of preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services are included in deferred charges asset 
the costs to acquire all preneed merchandise and service sales are included in the operating section of the cash flow statement as prearranged acquisition costs 
prearranged services and merchandise generally are funded either through trust funds or escrow accounts established by us or through third party insurance companies 
when prearranged services and merchandise are funded through insurance policies purchased by customers from third party insurance companies  we earn a commission on the sale of the policies 
insurance commissions  net of related expenses  are recognized at the point at which the commission is no longer subject to refund 
policy proceeds including the buildup in the face value of the insurance contracts are available to us as services and merchandise are delivered 
prearranged receivables are related to preneed sales of funeral and cemetery merchandise and services 
prearranged receivables represent the funds owed to us from preneed funeral merchandise and services trusts and from preneed cemetery merchandise and services trusts  which represent amounts already paid by customers  and realized earnings on those amounts  from customers and from insurance companies 
prearranged deferred revenue represents the revenue we will recognize upon delivery of the preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services at the time of need 
the net change in prearranged receivables and prearranged deferred revenue is recognized in the cash flow statement in the operating section as a change in prearranged activity 
if a preneed funeral product or service contract is cancelled  we generally return to the customer the related principal that was placed in trust and retain the portion not placed in trust 
in many jurisdictions  we can withdraw and retain all related earnings in the trust  but in other jurisdictions these earnings must be returned to the customer 
if a preneed cemetery property  product or service contract is cancelled  we generally are not required to return any funds to the customer 
the impact of preneed sales on near term cash flow depends primarily on the commissions paid on the sale  the portion of the sale required to be placed into trust and the terms of the particular contract such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
we generally pay commissions to our preneed sales counselors based on a percentage of the total preneed contract price  but only to the extent cash is paid by the customer 
if the initial cash installment paid by the customer is not sufficient to cover the entire commission  the remaining commission is paid from subsequent customer installments 
however  because we are required to place a portion of each cash installment paid by the customer into trust  we may be required to use our own cash to cover a portion of the commission due on the installment from the customer 
accordingly  preneed sales are generally cash flow negative initially but become cash flow positive at varying times over the life of the contract  depending upon the trusting requirements and the terms of the particular contract 
cash expended for preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service sales  principally sales commissions  is capitalized in deferred charges on the balance sheet and amortized and expensed as cost of sales as the contracts are delivered 
summary of current accounting for trust and escrow account earnings preneed funeral merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts 
we defer recognition of all earnings realized by preneed funeral merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts until the underlying funeral service or merchandise is delivered 
we generally do not withdraw cash principal and earnings from these trust funds and escrow accounts until the merchandise or service is delivered 
principal and realized earnings in these funds and escrow accounts are reflected as prearranged receivables  net asset on the balance sheet 
the full contract amount and realized earnings in these funds and escrow accounts are reflected as prearranged deferred revenue  net liability on the balance sheet 
unrealized gains and losses are not reflected on the balance sheet or income statement but are included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item preneed cemetery merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts 
we defer all earnings realized by these trust funds and escrow accounts until the underlying merchandise or service is delivered 
we generally do not withdraw cash principal and earnings from these trust funds and escrow accounts until the merchandise or service is delivered 
principal and realized earnings in these funds and escrow accounts are reflected as prearranged receivables  net asset on the balance sheet 
the full contract amount and realized earnings in these funds and escrow accounts are reflected as prearranged deferred revenue  net liability on the balance sheet 
unrealized gains and losses are not reflected on the balance sheet or income statement but are included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item perpetual care trust funds 
pursuant to perpetual care contracts and laws  a portion  generally percent  of the proceeds from cemetery property sales is deposited into perpetual care trust funds 
the income from these funds  which have been established in most jurisdictions in which we operate cemeteries  is used for maintenance of our cemeteries  but principal  including in some jurisdictions net realized capital gains  must generally be held in perpetuity 
we recognize the earnings on our perpetual care trust funds as they are realized in the trust 
we generally withdraw the earnings on a monthly basis to offset the cost of maintaining our cemeteries 
principal in these funds is not reflected on the balance sheet because the principal must remain in the trust in perpetuity 
overview of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions see note b to the consolidated financial statements included in item 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  the following are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
allowance for doubtful accounts management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
we establish a reserve for uncollectible installment contracts and trade accounts based on a range of percentages applied to accounts receivable aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount 
depreciation of long lived assets buildings and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years and from to years  respectively  primarily using the straight line method 
these estimates of the useful lives may be affected by such factors as changes in regulatory requirements or changing market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets we periodically review for continued appropriateness the carrying value of our long lived assets including our prearranged receivables  cemetery property and property and equipment 
this review is based on our projections of anticipated undiscounted future cash flows 
if indicators of impairment were present  we would evaluate the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets compared to the carrying amount of those items 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable would be reduced to fair value 
while we believe that our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows and comparable sales values could materially affect our evaluations 
in the fourth quarter of  we identified a number of small businesses to close or sell in fiscal year based on our review of the carrying amount of these businesses compared to their fair value  we recorded a noncash charge of million related to the impairment of these long lived assets 
fair value was established based on our best estimate and is subject to revision in future periods as properties are actually sold or closed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a valuation allowance of million related to our prearranged receivable from our trust funds  which resulted in a reduction in prearranged receivables and a reduction in prearranged deferred revenue 
this valuation allowance was deemed necessary due to a decline in the overall market value of the underlying trust funds 
during fiscal year  the valuation allowance was decreased million due to an increase in the market value of the underlying trust funds 
as a result  prearranged receivables and prearranged deferred revenue increased by million 
as of october   the valuation allowance was million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item valuation of goodwill in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
although we were not required to implement sfas no 
until the first quarter of fiscal year  we implemented it in the first quarter of fiscal year our evaluation of goodwill for our operations is performed at the funeral and cemetery segment levels  which constitute our reporting units 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill of a reporting unit must be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
impairment losses are recognized when the estimated fair value of goodwill associated with all of our cemeteries or funeral homes is less than their respective carrying values 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result  a noncash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the cemetery segment was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the tax benefit of million associated with sfas no 
relates to properties that have generated tax deductible goodwill 
according to sfas no 
 deferred taxes are not recorded on properties that do not generate goodwill amortization for tax purposes 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for a discussion of sfas no 
and its impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to an annual review  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be greater than fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than fair value  we measure any impairment based on our estimates of current fair value compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record further impairment charges for these assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to million and million as of october  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of earnings 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment of long lived assets 
based on our assessment of the probability of realizing the million in tax benefits associated with the potential losses generated from the impairment  we determined that a million valuation allowance was appropriate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
based on estimates of taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable  we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of october  except as described above for the long lived asset impairment 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change our allowance  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations because we held our foreign operations and several small domestic operations for sale  in the third quarter of we began segregating the operating results of these businesses from the operations we will retain 
the following discussion segregates the financial results into two main categories in order to present our ongoing operating results and to provide more useful information for investors 
operations to be retained consist of those businesses we have owned and operated for the entire current fiscal year and last and that we plan to retain existing operations and those businesses that have been opened during this fiscal year or last and that we plan to retain opened operations 
closed and held for sale operations consist of those that have been sold or closed during this fiscal year or last and the businesses that are currently being offered for sale 
although we determined in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to close or sell a number of businesses  they were not offered for sale until the first quarter of fiscal accordingly  these operations are included in operations to be retained in the presentation that follows 
in future reports  some of these operations are expected to qualify and be reflected separately as discontinued operations as appropriate 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  funeral segment year ended october  increase decrease in millions funeral operations to be retained revenue existing operations opened operations costs existing operations opened operations gross profit existing operations opened operations funeral closed and held for sale operations revenue costs gross profit total funeral revenue total funeral costs total funeral gross profit total funeral revenue decreased million for the year ended october  compared to the corresponding period in primarily due to a decrease in revenue from closed and held for sale operations 
the decline in revenue from closed and held for sale operations resulted primarily from the completion of the sale of our foreign operations in the decline in total funeral revenue is also due to a decrease in funeral revenue from operations to be retained  primarily driven by a reduction in the number of funeral services performed coupled with a reduction in trust earnings recognized upon the delivery of preneed funerals 
the reduction in trust earnings resulted from lower investment returns realized in our preneed funeral trust funds during the last few years 
funeral revenue from operations to be retained decreased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in we experienced a percent decline  events in the number of funeral services performed by these businesses  partially offset by a percent increase in the average revenue per funeral service performed by these businesses 
the decrease in funeral revenue from operations to be retained was due to a million  or percent  decrease in funeral revenue from existing operations 
we experienced a percent decline  events in the number of funeral services performed by these businesses  partially offset by a percent increase in the average revenue per funeral service performed by these businesses 
we track our at need sales by market and regularly compare our performance with data from a variety of sources to gauge changes in market share 
our analysis of this data indicates to us that approximately percent of the decline in the number of funeral services performed was due to a decline in the number of deaths in our markets for fiscal year and approximately percent of the decline was due to a loss in market share 
funeral gross profit margin from existing operations decreased from percent for the year ended october  to percent for the corresponding period in the decline is primarily due to an increase in insurance costs coupled with the reduction in funeral revenue as discussed above 
the cremation rate for our existing operations was percent for the year ended october  compared to percent for the corresponding period in cemetery segment year ended october  increase decrease in millions cemetery operations to be retained revenue existing operations costs existing operations gross profit existing operations cemetery closed and held for sale operations revenue costs gross profit total cemetery revenue total cemetery costs total cemetery gross profit total cemetery revenue decreased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in we experienced an million  or percent  decrease in revenue from operations to be retained  primarily due to a decline in merchandise deliveries and reduced perpetual care trust earnings 
we believe the decline in merchandise deliveries during the year ended october  is due primarily to the fact that the merchandise delivered during fiscal year had a lower average value than the merchandise delivered during the comparable period in the decline in merchandise deliveries during fiscal year is also due in part to the decrease in the number of deaths in our markets in recent prior periods 
cemetery merchandise revenue is not recognized until the merchandise is delivered and installed 
typically  installation of cemetery merchandise occurs several months after the burial occurs 
thus  a decline in the number of deaths in one quarter can cause a decline in cemetery merchandise deliveries in subsequent quarters 
we experienced an annualized average return  excluding unrealized gains and losses  of percent in our perpetual care trust funds for the year ended october  resulting in revenue of million  compared to percent for the corresponding period in resulting in revenue of million 
we also experienced a decline in revenue from closed and held for sale operations due primarily to the completion of the sale of our foreign operations in fiscal year cemetery gross profit margin from existing operations decreased from percent for the year ended october  to percent for the corresponding period in the decline is due to increased insurance costs coupled with the reduction in cemetery revenue as discussed above 
other as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal year  goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal year our evaluation of goodwill is performed at the funeral and cemetery segments  which constitute our reporting units 
as a result  a noncash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the cemetery segment was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year in calculating the goodwill impairment charge  the fair value of the funeral and cemetery segments was determined with assistance from an independent valuation advisor using a combination of the comparable company approach and discounted cash flow valuation methodology 
for additional information on goodwill  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we identified a number of small businesses to close or sell  mostly funeral homes  and determined that their carrying value exceeded their fair values 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item this charge  along with the goodwill impairment charge discussed above  are presented together in the impairment of goodwill and long lived assets line item in the consolidated statement of earnings 
corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended october  increased million compared to the same period in the increase is primarily due to a million charge incurred during the third quarter of fiscal year for separation pay to two former executive officers 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item the increase is also due to increased legal fees and increased expenses related to the stewart enterprises  inc supplemental executive retirement plan the serp 
the serp  which became effective april   provides retirement benefits to certain executive officers that are intended to supplement the benefits available under our k plan and in part replace other benefits previously available under the executive officers employment agreements 
depreciation and amortization was million for the year ended october  compared to million for the same period in the decrease is due to the sale of our remaining foreign operations in fiscal year interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended october  compared to million for the same period in the decrease is due to a million decrease in the average debt outstanding during the fiscal year ended october   partially offset by an approximate basis point increase in our average interest rate 
as of october  and january   our outstanding debt totaled million and million  respectively 
on may   we exercised our right to redeem our outstanding million remarketable or redeemable securities roars rather than allowing them to be remarketed and recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
in order to redeem the roars  we used million of additional term loan b financing and million from our revolving credit facility 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of the total amount of debt outstanding  including the portion subject to the interest rate swap agreements in effect as of october   approximately percent was fixed rate debt  with the remaining percent subject to short term variable interest rates averaging approximately percent 
in order to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt  effective march   we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  expiring on march  and march   each involving a notional amount of million 
the agreements effectively convert variable rate debt bearing interest based on three month libor plus the applicable margin specified under our senior secured credit facility to fixed rate debt bearing interest at the fixed swap rate plus such applicable margin 
as of october   the effective rate of the debt hedged by the interest rate swaps was percent and percent on each million swapped 
other income  net  amounted to million for the years ended october  and and is comprised mostly of net gains on domestic funeral home sales 
we have approximately million of assets held for sale  consisting primarily of domestic funeral homes 
in the fourth quarter of  we identified a number of small businesses to close or sell  and as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  we recorded an impairment charge 
these businesses were not offered for sale until the first quarter of any further losses or gains related to the sale of these businesses which qualify as discontinued operations will be reflected as such in the future 
any future sales of assets which do not meet the discontinued operations criteria may generate gains or losses that would be reflected in continuing operations in future periods 
preneed sales and deliveries the revenues from our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service sales are deferred into our backlog and are not included in our operating results above 
we added million in preneed sales to our funeral and cemetery merchandise and service backlog during the year ended october  to be recognized in the future  net of cancellations  as these prepaid products and services are delivered  compared to million for the corresponding period in deliveries out of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service backlog  including accumulated trust fund earnings related to these preneed deliveries  amounted to million for the year ended october   compared to million for the year ended october  year ended october  compared to year ended october  funeral segment year ended october  increase decrease in millions funeral operations to be retained revenue existing operations opened operations costs existing operations opened operations gross profit existing operations opened operations funeral closed and held for sale operations revenue costs gross profit total funeral revenue total funeral costs total funeral gross profit funeral costs for operations to be retained and closed and held for sale operations for the year ended october  include million and million of goodwill amortization  respectively  for a total of million of goodwill amortization included in total funeral costs 
excluding goodwill amortization  funeral gross profit for operations to be retained for increased by million when compared to the year ended october   and total funeral gross profit for decreased by million when compared to the corresponding period in total funeral revenue decreased million for the year ended october  compared to the corresponding period in primarily due to a decrease in revenue from closed and held for sale operations  which was partially offset by an increase in revenue from operations to be retained 
the decline in revenue from closed and held for sale operations resulted primarily from the sale of our operations in mexico  australia  new zealand  belgium and the netherlands in the fourth quarter of and the sale of our operations in spain  portugal  france  canada and argentina in fiscal year funeral revenue from operations to be retained increased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in the average revenue per funeral service performed by these businesses increased percent  partially offset by a 
percent decline events in the number of funeral services performed 
we experienced a million  or percent  increase in funeral revenue from existing operations primarily due to a percent increase in the average revenue per funeral service performed  partially offset by a percent decline  events in the number of funeral services performed by these businesses 
the increase in average revenue per funeral service is due primarily to customized funeral planning and personalization 
we experienced a million increase in funeral revenue and a million increase in funeral costs from opened operations primarily due to the opening of an archdiocese of los angeles facility which was not open for the entirety of both periods presented 
funeral gross profit margin from existing operations increased from percent for the year ended october  to percent for the corresponding period in this increase is due to the elimination of goodwill amortization from the implementation of sfas no 
if we had implemented sfas no 
in  the pro forma funeral gross profit margin from existing operations adjusted for the elimination of goodwill amortization would have been percent for the year ended october  goodwill amortization for existing operations in the funeral segment amounted to million for the year ended october  the cremation rate for our existing operations was percent for the year ended october  compared to percent for the same period in cemetery segment year ended october  increase decrease in millions cemetery operations to be retained revenue existing operations costs existing operations gross profit existing operations cemetery closed and held for sale operations revenue costs gross profit total cemetery revenue total cemetery costs total cemetery gross profit cemetery costs for operations to be retained and closed and held for sale operations for the year ended october  include million and 
million of goodwill amortization  respectively  for a total of million of goodwill amortization included in total cemetery costs 
excluding goodwill amortization  cemetery gross profit for operations to be retained for decreased by million when compared to the year ended october   and total cemetery gross profit for declined by million when compared to the corresponding period in total cemetery revenue decreased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in we experienced a million  or percent  decrease in revenue from operations to be retained primarily due to a reduction in preneed cemetery property sales and merchandise deliveries and a decline in the average return earned on perpetual care trust funds 
we experienced an annualized average return of percent in our perpetual care trust funds for the year ended october   compared to percent for the corresponding period in we also experienced a million decline in revenue from closed and held for sale operations primarily related to the sale of our foreign operations 
cemetery gross profit margin from existing operations decreased from percent for the year ended october  to percent for the corresponding period in the decrease is due to the decline in preneed cemetery property sales and merchandise deliveries and the decrease in perpetual care trust earnings coupled with the high fixed cost nature of the cemetery business 
the decrease was moderated by the elimination of goodwill amortization from the implementation of sfas no 
if we had implemented sfas no 
in  the pro forma cemetery gross profit margin from existing operations adjusted for the elimination of goodwill amortization would have been percent for the year ended october  goodwill amortization for existing operations in the cemetery segment amounted to million for the year ended october  other corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended october  decreased 
million compared to the same period in primarily due to a reduction in professional and consulting fees partially offset by expenses associated with the stewart enterprises  inc supplemental executive retirement plan the serp  which was adopted effective april  the serp provides retirement benefits to certain executive officers that are intended to supplement the benefits available under the company s k plan and in part replace other benefits previously available under the executive officers employment agreements 
adoption of the serp resulted in a charge to corporate general and administrative expenses of million for fiscal year depreciation and amortization was million for the year ended october  compared to million for the same period in  which included million of goodwill amortization 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization is due to the implementation of sfas no 
and the sale of certain of our foreign assets 
interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended october  compared to million for the same period in the decrease is due to a million decrease in the average debt outstanding during the fiscal year ended october   offset by an approximate basis point increase in our average interest rate 
the increase in our average interest rate resulted from higher interest costs associated with debt incurred in our debt refinancing transactions which occurred on june  investment income decreased million to 
million for the year ended october  compared to the same period in this decrease is due primarily to a million decrease in the average cash and cash equivalents balance and a decrease in the average investment rate earned on our cash and cash equivalent investments from percent to percent 
the percent earned for the year ended october  included returns on funds in foreign jurisdictions that earned percent 
the majority of the funds in foreign jurisdictions were sold with our mexican operations 
other income  net  decreased million to million during the year ended october  compared to the same period in the decrease is principally due to the net gains on the sale of excess cemetery property and other domestic assets during as of october   our outstanding debt was million 
of the total amount outstanding  including the portion subject to the interest rate swap agreements in effect as of october   approximately percent was fixed rate debt  with the remaining percent subject to a short term variable interest rate of approximately percent 
in order to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt  effective march   we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  expiring on march  and march   each involving a notional amount of million

preneed sales and deliveries the revenues from our domestic preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service sales are deferred into our backlog and are not included in our operating results above 
we added million in preneed sales to our funeral and cemetery merchandise and service backlog during the year ended october  to be recognized in the future  net of cancellations  as these prepaid products and services are delivered  compared to million for the corresponding period in deliveries out of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service backlog  including accumulated trust fund earnings related to these preneed deliveries  amounted to million for the year ended october   compared to million for the year ended october  liquidity and capital resources cash flow our operations provided cash of million for the year ended october  compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease in operating cash flow is due primarily to a reduction in earnings before taxes  an increase in the investment in preneed activity and an increase in cash used to pay income taxes 
the decrease was partially offset by a million tax refund received related to the sale of our foreign operations in fiscal year compared to an million tax refund received in fiscal year related to the sale of our foreign operations 
included in the provision for deferred income taxes and the increase in receivables as of october  is a million change relating to a tax accounting change which defers revenues that had been previously includable in taxable income and for which we had a tax refund receivable as of october  we received the million refund in december the drivers of the reduction in our earnings and the increase in the investment in preneed activity are discussed in detail in overview of fiscal year  preneed sales and results of operations year ended october  compared to year ended october  under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our expectations for cash flow for are discussed in forward looking statements 
our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash inflow of million for fiscal year the change is due primarily to million in proceeds from the sale of our foreign operations  domestic funeral home real estate and small domestic operations we received in fiscal year compared to million received in fiscal year our financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for the comparable period in the change is primarily due to the million in proceeds from long term debt received in fiscal year and the million remarketing right paid in fiscal year in connection with the debt refinancing discussed under the heading contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the change is also due to repayments of long term debt of million in the year ended october   compared to million in the comparable period of contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of october   our outstanding debt balance was million 
we received a million tax refund in december due to a change in the tax accounting methods for cemetery merchandise revenue 
we used this refund and cash on hand to reduce our outstanding debt balance to million as of january  the following table details our known future cash payments in millions related to various contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years contractual obligations total thereafter current maturities of long term debt long term debt operating lease agreements non competition and other agreements see below for a breakdown of our future scheduled principal payments and maturities of long term debt by type as of october  our noncancellable operating leases are primarily for land and buildings and expire over the next to years  except for six leases that expire between and our future minimum lease payments as of october  are million  million  million  million  million and million for the years ending october      and later years  respectively 
we have entered into non competition agreements with prior owners and key employees of acquired subsidiaries that expire through during fiscal year  we decided to relieve some of the prior owners and key employees of their obligations not to compete  however  we will continue to make the payments in accordance with the contract terms 
this category also includes separation pay related to two former executive officers payable over the next years 
as stated above  we received a million tax refund in december  which was used to reduce the outstanding term loan b balance  and our outstanding debt balance as of january  was million 
we expect to be able to reduce our debt with approximately million of remaining income tax benefits related to the sale of our foreign operations  the majority of which we expect to receive during and the following table reflects future scheduled principal payments and maturities of our long term debt in millions as of october  other  principally seller fiscal revolving senior financing of year ending credit term subordinated acquired october  facility loan b notes public notes operations total thereafter total long term debt on may   we used million of additional term loan b financing along with million from our revolving credit facility to redeem our million outstanding roars 
when the remarketing dealer elected to remarket the roars  we exercised our right to redeem the roars rather than allow them to be remarketed 
we paid the remarketing dealer million  the contractually specified value of the remarketing right 
net of the million unamortized roars option premium and 
million in costs  we recorded a charge of million million after tax  or 
per share in the third quarter of fiscal year in connection with the redemption of the roars  we amended the loan covenants that govern our revolving credit and term loan b credit 
the amendment to the credit agreement provides greater financial flexibility as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item we also have million of outstanding letters of credit as of october   and we are required to maintain a bond to guarantee our obligations relating to funds we withdrew from our preneed funeral trusts in florida 
we substituted a bond to guarantee performance under certain preneed funeral contracts and agreed to maintain unused credit facilities in an amount that will equal or exceed the bond amount 
as of october   the balance of the florida bond was million 
we believe that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to cover our estimated cost of providing the related prearranged services and products in the future 
as of october  and january   there was million drawn on our million revolving credit facility 
as of october  and january   our availability under the revolving credit facility  after giving consideration to the aforementioned letters of credit  bond obligation and the required reserve  was million and million  respectively 
we expect to be able to pay the million of debt coming due in fiscal year using cash from operations or by drawing on our revolving credit facility 
it is not our intention to pay all remaining amounts on our long term debt exclusively from cash flow from operations 
we expect to be able to refinance the debt well in advance of the maturity dates 
any refinancing could result in additional interest and other costs depending primarily on financial markets and our credit profile at the time of refinancing 
capital expenditures for fiscal year  capital expenditures amounted to million  which included million for maintenance capital expenditures and million for new growth initiatives 
for fiscal year  we anticipate maintenance capital expenditures consistent with fiscal year and new growth initiatives of up to million  including the construction of the los angeles funeral homes 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures in fiscal year other than approximately million related to the archdiocese of los angeles funeral homes 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements as of october  consist of the following two items the million bond we are required to maintain to guarantee our obligations relating to funds we withdrew from our preneed funeral trusts in florida  which is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  and our preneed funeral  merchandise and perpetual care trust funds  which are discussed both in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item and at summary of current accounting for trust and escrow account earnings above 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was as follows years ended october  pretax earnings for fiscal year include a charge of million for the loss on early extinguishment of debt in connection with redemption of the roars and a noncash charge of million for the impairment charges related to goodwill and long lived asset impairment 
as a result of these charges  our earnings for the fiscal year ended october  were insufficient to cover our fixed charges  and an additional million in pretax earnings would have been required to eliminate the coverage deficiency 
pretax earnings for fiscal year include a noncash charge of million in connection with the writedown of assets held for sale 
excludes the cumulative effect of change in accounting principles 
pretax earnings for fiscal year include a noncash charge of million in connection with the writedown of assets held for sale and other charges and million charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt 
as a result of these charges  our earnings for the fiscal year ended october  were insufficient to cover our fixed charges  and an additional million in pretax earnings would have been required to eliminate the coverage deficiency 
for purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  earnings consist of pretax earnings plus fixed charges excluding interest capitalized during the period 
fixed charges consist of interest expense  capitalized interest  amortization of debt expense and discount or premium relating to any indebtedness and the portion of rental expense that management believes to be representative of the interest component of rental expense 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended october  and reflects the implementation of sfas no 
 fiscal year reflects the change in accounting principles  and fiscal years and reflect the change in accounting principle 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations over the past three years  nor is it expected to have a significant impact in the foreseeable future 
recent accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item forward looking statements certain statements made herein or elsewhere by us or on our behalf that are not historical facts are intended to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements may include the words may  will  estimate  intend  continue  believe  expect  plan or anticipate and other similar words 
these statements include any projections of earnings  revenues  asset sales  cash flow  debt levels or other financial items  any statements of the plans  strategies and objectives of management for future operations  any statements concerning proposed new products  services or developments  any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance  any statements of belief  and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
forward looking statements contained in this report include but are not limited to the financial projections made in this section and the assumptions underlying them  along with statements relating to anticipated future performance of our preneed sales program  anticipated future performance of funds held in trust  anticipated mortality trends  potential results of our new operating initiatives  our current plans for deployment of our projected cash flow  the anticipated impact of the recent workforce reduction and restructuring and the success and timing of selling the small businesses we identified in the fourth quarter of fiscal year accuracy of the forecasts is dependent upon assumptions about events that change over time and is thus susceptible to periodic change based on actual experience and new developments 
the forecasts are based on a variety of estimates and assumptions made by our management with respect to  among other things  industry performance  general economic  market  industry and interest rate conditions  preneed and at need sales activities and trends  fluctuations in cost of goods sold and other expenses  capital expenditures  and other matters that cannot be accurately predicted  may not be realized and are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the assumptions made in preparing the forecasts will prove accurate  and actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forecasts 
for these reasons  the forecasts should not be regarded as an accurate prediction of future results  but only of results that may be obtained if substantially all of our principal expectations are realized 
we caution readers that we assume no obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements made herein or any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
we project that earnings for continuing operations will be in the range of 
and 
per share for fiscal year including the 
per share impact for severance costs related to the workforce reductions announced in december we expect cash flow from operations to be between million and million  including the million tax refund received in december due to a change in the tax accounting methods for cemetery merchandise revenue 
maintenance capital expenditures are expected to be between million and million 
our forecast for continuing operations is based on the following principal assumptions an increase in revenue of to percent for continuing operations and a corresponding increase in the associated direct costs 
the increase in revenue is expected to be driven by an increase in the average revenue per service performed of approximately to percent  excluding any impact from funeral trust earnings  and an increase in preneed property sales of to percent 
increases in average revenue per service performed may be partially offset by a decrease in the number of families served by continuing operations in as compared to the upper end of the forecast range assumes that these businesses will serve the same number of families during fiscal year as in  and the lower end assumes a possible reduction in the number of families served of up to percent  which is in line with trends over the last few years 
revenue from trust earnings  including earnings from funeral  merchandise and perpetual care trust funds  is expected to be about the same as that recognized in our cost saving initiatives  including the reduction in workforce  are expected to reduce costs by million to million 
these cost savings are expected to be partially offset by about million to million in normal inflation of costs remaining in the business  assuming an inflation rate of approximately percent 
we expect to use cash flow from operations to maintain our facilities at a level comparable to  to reduce debt and to repurchase stock  or for growth initiatives as appropriate 
these forecasts for continuing operations exclude the results of a number of small businesses that we have decided to close or sell  the results of which will be reported separately as discontinued operations as appropriate in future reports 
cautionary statements we caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future  could affect  our actual consolidated results and could cause our actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the goals and expectations expressed in the forward looking statements above and in any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
risks related to our business earnings from and principal of trust funds and escrow accounts could be reduced by changes in stock and bond prices and interest and dividend rates or by a decline in the size of the funds 
we maintain three types of trust funds and escrow accounts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services and perpetual care 
earnings and investment gains and losses on trust funds and escrow accounts are affected by financial market conditions that are not within our control 
earnings are also affected by the mix of fixed income and equity securities that we choose to maintain in the funds  and we may not choose the optimal mix for any particular market condition 
the size of the funds depends upon the level of preneed sales and maturities  the amount of ordinary income and investment gains or losses and funds added through acquisitions  if any 
declines in earnings from perpetual care trust funds would cause a decline in current revenues  while declines in earnings from other trust funds and escrow accounts could cause a decline in future cash flows and revenues 
in addition  any significant or sustained investment losses could result in there being insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the cost of delivering services and merchandise or maintaining cemeteries in the future 
any such deficiency would have to be covered by cash flow  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
unrealized gains and losses in the funeral trust funds and cemetery merchandise trust funds have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow  unless the fair market value of the funds were to decline below the estimated costs to deliver the underlying products and services 
if that were to occur  we would record a charge to earnings to record a liability for the expected losses on the delivery of the associated contract 
over time  gains and losses realized in the funds are allocated to underlying preneed contracts and affect the amount of the trust fund earnings we record when we deliver the underlying product or service 
accordingly  if current market conditions do not improve  the funds may eventually realize losses  and our revenues  margins  earnings and cash flow would be negatively affected by the reduced revenue when we deliver the underlying products and services 
this factor adversely affected our results in fiscal year and may do so again in fiscal year we project that with approximately percent to percent annualized returns in the funds over the estimated lives of the associated preneed contracts  our trust and escrow funds would recover the net unrealized depreciation currently in the funds by the time the underlying products and services are delivered 
unrealized gains and losses in the perpetual care trust fund do not affect earnings but could limit the capital gains available to us and could result in lower returns and lower current revenues than we have historically achieved 
increased costs may have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows 
overall costs are expected to decline in due to our cost reduction operating initiatives  including the workforce restructuring and reduction that occurred in december the cost reduction initiatives are expected to reduce costs million to million 
these cost savings are expected to be partially offset by about million to million in normal inflation of costs remaining in the business 
we may not be successful in fully implementing these initiatives and may incur additional costs 
insurance costs  in particular  have increased substantially 
the terrorist attacks in the united states on september  and related subsequent events have resulted in higher insurance premiums 
the volume of claims made in such a short span of time resulted in liquidity challenges that many insurers have passed on to their policyholders 
additionally  insurers have increased premiums to offset losses in equity markets due to recent economic conditions 
while our insurance costs have increased materially  additional increases in insurance costs cannot be predicted 
we may experience declines in preneed sales due to numerous factors  including changes made to contract terms and sales force compensation and a weakening economy 
declines in preneed property sales would reduce current revenue 
declines in preneed funeral and cemetery service and merchandise sales would reduce our backlog and could reduce our future market share 
in an effort to increase cash flow  we modified our preneed sales strategies early in fiscal year by increasing finance charges  requiring larger down payments and shortening installment payment terms 
later in fiscal year  we changed the compensation structure for our preneed sales force 
these changes  and the accompanying sales force attrition and adverse impact on sales force morale  caused preneed sales to decline 
although we do not anticipate making further significant changes in these areas  we may decide that further adjustments are advisable  which could cause additional declines in preneed sales 
in addition  a weakening economy that causes customers to reduce discretionary spending could cause  and we believe has caused  a decline in preneed sales 
geopolitical concerns could continue to lower consumer confidence  which could also result in a further decline in preneed sales 
declines in preneed cemetery property sales would reduce current revenue  and declines in other preneed sales would reduce our backlog and future revenue and could reduce future market share 
one of the new operating initiatives announced in was the creation of a preneed cemetery property task force  which is strategically targeting businesses with maximum preneed sales potential and developing specific plans to increase preneed property sales and attain new customers at each of the targeted locations 
however  we can give no assurance that we will be successful in implementing this operating initiative 
our ability to increase funeral call volume is influenced by many factors such as the decline in deaths  competition  our ability to identify changing consumer preferences and various other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
one of the new operating initiatives announced in was the creation of a funeral call volume task force  which is using the most successful tactics of our top performing funeral homes to develop strategies to drive funeral call growth throughout our organization with an increased focus on preneed funeral sales 
we can give no assurance that we will be successful in implementing this operating initiative 
we discuss the risk of declining deaths  intense competition and our ability to identify changing consumer preferences in other risk factors herein 
our ability to dispose of certain identified small businesses at prices consistent with our expectations depends on several factors  many of which are beyond our control 
any changes in expected sales prices or basis of these businesses could result in additional impairment charges or could adversely affect our ability to sell these businesses at prices we are willing to accept 
in december  we announced our plans to close or sell a number of small businesses  primarily small funeral homes  most of which were acquired as part of a group of facilities  that are performing below acceptable levels and no longer fit our operating profile 
we believe that the closing or sale of those businesses will enable management to focus on our most productive operations where our operating initiatives may bring about the greatest benefits in increased revenues 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to dispose of these businesses or that buyers will accept our terms  nor can we give any assurance that the selling prices of these businesses will not be materially different from our expectations 
any variance between the anticipated and actual sale prices or changes in the basis of these businesses would result in a change in the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of our ability to service our debt in the future depends upon our ability to generate sufficient cash  which depends upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our ability to service our debt depends upon our ability to generate sufficient cash 
we expect to be able to reduce our debt with approximately million of remaining income tax benefits relating to the sale of our foreign operations  the majority of which we expect to receive during and our ability to receive the expected income tax benefits within our expected time frame depends upon  among other things  the timing of our filing for capital loss carrybacks to apply against previously taxed capital gains and the rate at which we realize additional capital gains 
our primary tax planning strategy is to produce these capital gains in our trust funds 
our ability to generate capital gains could be affected by a decline in market conditions 
our ability to generate cash flows from operations depends upon  among other things  the number of deaths in our markets  competition  the level of preneed sales and their maturities  our ability to control our costs  stock and bond market conditions  and general economic  financial and regulatory factors  most of which are beyond our control 
it is not our intention to pay amounts due on our long term debt maturing in fiscal year and beyond exclusively with cash flow from operations 
we expect to refinance the debt well in advance of their maturities 
if we are unsuccessful in refinancing this debt  we may not generate sufficient cash from operations to satisfy this debt as it becomes due 
our ability to refinance this debt  and potential increased interest and other costs associated with refinancings  depends primarily on financial markets and our credit profile at the time of the refinancing 
increased preneed sales may have a negative impact on cash flow 
preneed sales of cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services are generally cash flow negative initially  primarily due to the commissions paid on the sale  the portion of the sales proceeds required to be placed into trust or escrow and the terms of the particular contract such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
in fiscal year  we changed the terms and conditions of preneed sales contracts and commissions and moderated our preneed sales effort in order to reduce the initial negative impact on cash flow 
nevertheless  we will continue to invest a significant portion of cash flow in preneed acquisition costs  which reduces cash flow available for other activities  and  to the extent preneed activities are increased  cash flow would be further reduced  and our ability to service debt could be adversely affected 
price competition could reduce market share or cause us to reduce prices to retain or recapture market share  either of which could reduce revenues and margins 
our funeral home and cemetery operations generally face intense competition in local markets that typically are served by numerous funeral homes and cemetery firms 
we have historically experienced price competition primarily from independent funeral home and cemetery operators  and from monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and other non traditional providers of services or products 
from time to time  this price competition has resulted in losing market share in some markets 
in other markets  we have had to reduce prices thereby reducing profit margins in order to retain or recapture market share 
increased price competition in the future could further reduce revenues  profit margins and the backlog and potentially impact our annual goodwill impairment analysis 
increased advertising or better marketing by competitors  or increased activity by competitors offering products or services over the internet  could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to incur increased costs in order to retain or recapture our market share 
in recent years  the marketing of preneed funeral services through television  radio and print advertising  direct mailings and personal sales calls has increased 
extensive advertising or effective marketing by competitors in local markets could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to increase marketing costs 
in addition  competitors may change the types or mix of products or services offered 
these changes may attract customers  causing us to lose market share and revenue or to incur costs in response to competition in order to vary the types or mix of products or services offered by us 
also  increased use of the internet by customers to research and or purchase products and services could cause us to lose market share to competitors offering to sell products or services over the internet 
increases in interest rates would increase interest costs on our variable rate long term debt and could have a material adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share 
as of january   million of our long term debt was subject to variable interest rates  although million of that amount was fixed pursuant to the terms of interest rate swaps expiring in march of and accordingly  any significant increase in interest rates could increase our interest costs on our variable rate long term debt or indebtedness incurred in the future  which could decrease our net income and earnings per share materially 
covenant restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated note indenture limit our flexibility in operating our business 
our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes contain  among other things  covenants that restrict us and our subsidiary guarantors ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
they limit  among other things  our and our subsidiary guarantors ability to borrow money  pay dividends or distributions  purchase or redeem stock  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in sale leaseback transactions  consummate specified asset sales  effect a consolidation or merger or sell  transfer  lease  or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets  and create liens on assets 
in addition  the senior secured credit facility contains specific limits on capital expenditures and the prepayment of debt other than that incurred under the senior secured credit facility and requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests 
these covenants may require us to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
in addition  events beyond our control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  may affect our ability to satisfy these covenants 
a breach of any of those covenants could result in a default  allowing the lenders to declare all amounts owed immediately due and payable 
our projections for do not include any earnings from acquisition activity 
several important factors  among others  may affect our ability to consummate acquisitions 
our projections for do not include any earnings from acquisition activity 
the actual level of acquisition activity  if any  will depend not only on the number of properties acquired  but also on the size of the acquisitions 
several important factors  among others  may affect our ability to consummate acquisitions 
we may not be able to find a sufficient number of businesses for sale at prices we are willing to pay  particularly in view of our new pricing parameters and cash flow criteria 
acquisition activity  if any  will also depend on our ability to enter into new markets 
due in part to our lack of experience operating in new areas and to the presence of competitors who have been in certain markets longer than we have  such entry may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate 
risks related to the death care industry declines in the number of deaths in our markets can cause a decrease in revenues 
changes in the number of deaths are not predictable from market to market or over the short term 
declines in the number of deaths could cause at need sales of funeral and cemetery services  property and merchandise to decline  which could decrease revenues 
this factor adversely affected our results in fiscal year and may do so again in fiscal year although the united states bureau of the census estimates that the number of deaths in the united states will increase by approximately percent per year from to  longer lifespans could reduce the rate of deaths 
changes in the number of deaths can vary among local markets and from quarter to quarter  and variations in the number of deaths in our markets or from quarter to quarter are not predictable 
however  generally the number of deaths fluctuate with the seasons with more deaths occurring during the winter months primarily resulting from pneumonia and influenza 
these variations can cause revenues to fluctuate 
our comparisons of the change in the number of families served to the change in the number of deaths reported by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc from time to time may not necessarily be meaningful 
the cdc receives weekly mortality reports from cities and metropolitan areas in the united states within two to three weeks from the date of death and reports the total number of deaths occurring in these areas each week based on the reports received from state health departments 
the comparability of our funeral calls to the cdc data is limited  as reports from the state health departments are often delayed  and the cities reporting to the cdc are not necessarily comparable with the markets in which we operate 
the increasing number of cremations in the united states could cause revenues to decline because we could lose market share to firms specializing in cremations 
in addition  basic cremations produce no revenues for cemetery operations and lesser funeral revenues and  in certain cases  lesser profit margins than traditional funerals 
our traditional cemetery and funeral service operations face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the united states 
industry studies indicate that the percentage of cremations has steadily increased and that cremations will represent approximately percent of the united states burial market by the year  compared to percent in the trends toward cremation could cause cemeteries and traditional funeral homes to lose market share and revenues to firms specializing in cremations 
in addition  basic cremations with no funeral service  casket  urn  mausoleum niche  columbarium niche or burial produce no revenues for cemetery operations and lower revenues than traditional funerals and  when delivered at a traditional funeral home  produce lower profit margins as well 
if we are not able to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences  our market share  revenues and profitability could decrease 
future market share  revenues and profits will depend in part on our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to changing consumer preferences 
during fiscal year  we began to implement strategies based on a proprietary  extensive study of consumer preferences we commissioned in however  we may not correctly anticipate or identify trends in consumer preferences  or we may identify them later than our competitors do 
in addition  any strategies we may implement to address these trends may prove incorrect or ineffective 
because the funeral and cemetery businesses are high fixed cost businesses  positive or negative changes in revenue can have a disproportionately large effect on cash flow and profits 
companies in the funeral home and cemetery business must incur many of the costs of operating and maintaining facilities  land and equipment regardless of the level of sales in any given period 
for example  we must pay salaries  utilities  property taxes and maintenance costs on funeral homes and maintain the grounds of cemeteries regardless of the number of funeral services or interments performed 
because we cannot decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when we experience declines in sales  declines in sales can cause margins  profits and cash flow to decline at a greater rate than the decline in revenues 
changes or increases in  or failure to comply with  regulations applicable to our business could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
the death care industry is subject to extensive regulation and licensing requirements under federal  state and local laws 
for example  the funeral home industry is regulated by the federal trade commission  which requires funeral homes to take actions designed to protect consumers 
state laws impose licensing requirements and regulate preneed sales 
embalming facilities are subject to stringent environmental and health regulations 
compliance with these regulations is burdensome  and we are always at risk of not complying with the regulations 
in addition  from time to time  governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations  which could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
for example  federal  state  local and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the death care industry 
several states and regulatory agencies have considered or are considering regulations that could require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for preneed sales of products and services  limit or eliminate our ability to use surety bonding  increase trust requirements and prohibit the common ownership of funeral homes and cemeteries in the same market 
if adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate  these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  our results of operations  our cash flows and our future prospects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in the prices of marketable equity securities and interest rates as discussed below 
generally  our market risk sensitive instruments and positions are characterized as other than trading 
our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in equity markets or interest rates 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based on actual fluctuations in equity markets  interest rates and the timing of transactions 
marketable equity securities as of october  and  our marketable equity securities subject to market risk consisted principally of investments held by our prearranged funeral  merchandise and perpetual care trust funds and escrow accounts and had fair values of million and million  respectively  which were determined using final sale prices quoted on stock exchanges 
each percent change in the average market prices of the equity securities held in such accounts would result in a change of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair value of such accounts 
our prearranged funeral  merchandise and perpetual care trust funds and escrow accounts  which are managed by iti  are detailed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in item iti operates pursuant to a formal investment policy as discussed in operations included in item interest we have entered into various fixed and variable rate debt obligations  which are detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item as of october  and  the carrying values of our long term fixed rate debt  including accrued interest  were approximately million and million  respectively  compared to fair values of million and million  respectively 
fair values were determined using quoted market prices 
each approximate percent change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt  and basis points for and  respectively  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair values of these instruments 
if these instruments are held to maturity  no change in fair value will be realized 
in order to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt  effective march   we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  each involving a notional amount of million 
the first agreement effectively converts million of variable rate debt bearing interest based on three month libor to a fixed rate based on the swap rate of percent and expires on march  the second agreement effectively converts million of variable rate debt bearing interest based on three month libor to a fixed rate based on the swap rate of percent and expires on march  the estimated fair value of the interest rate swaps based on quoted market prices was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the average interest rates applicable to such debt would result in an increase of approximately 
million and million in the fair value of these instruments as of october  and october   respectively 
as of october  and  the carrying values of our term loan b and revolving credit facility were million and million  respectively  compared to fair values of million and million  respectively 
of the million outstanding under term loan b and the revolving credit facility on october   million was not hedged by the interest rate swaps and was subject to short term variable interest rates 
each approximate percent  or basis point  change in the average interest rate applicable to this debt would result in a change of approximately 
million in our pretax earnings 
fair value was determined using quoted market prices  where applicable  or future cash flows discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
of the million outstanding under term loan b on october   million was not hedged by the interest rate swaps and was subject to short term variable interest rates 
each approximate percent  or basis point  change in the average interest rate applicable to this debt would result in a change of approximately 
million in our pretax earnings 
we monitor our mix of fixed and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate senior secured credit facility with fixed rate debt or by entering into interest rate swaps 
as of october  and  our fixed income securities subject to market risk consisted principally of investments in our prearranged funeral  merchandise and perpetual care trust funds and escrow accounts and had aggregate quoted market values of million and million  respectively 
each percent change in interest rates on these fixed income securities would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair values of such securities based on discounted expected future cash flows 
if these securities are held to maturity  no change in fair value will be realized 
as of october  and  our money market and other short term investments subject to market risk  including amounts held in preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust funds  and in perpetual care trust funds  had carrying values approximating their fair values of million and million  respectively 
under our current accounting methods  a change in the average interest rate earned by our prearranged funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust funds would not result in a change in our current pretax earnings 
as such  as of october  and  only million and million  respectively  of these short term investments  which includes amounts in the perpetual care trust funds and other short term investments not held in trust  were subject to changes in interest rates 
each percent change in average interest rates applicable to such investments  and basis points for and  respectively  would result in changes of approximately 
million  respectively  in our pretax earnings 
the fixed income securities  money market and other short term investments owned by us are principally invested in our prearranged funeral  merchandise and perpetual care trust funds and escrow accounts  which are managed by iti 
iti operates pursuant to a formal investment policy as discussed above 
trust funds as of october   our marketable equity securities and fixed income securities subject to market risk consisted principally of investments held by our prearranged funeral  cemetery merchandise and perpetual care trust funds and escrow accounts 
we estimate that each basis point increase or decrease in the yield  which excludes unrealized gains and losses  on the preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and perpetual care trust funds  based on october  balances  would result in an approximate increase or decrease in our revenues associated with the delivery of prearranged products and services and earnings from the perpetual care trust funds of million in  million in and million in
