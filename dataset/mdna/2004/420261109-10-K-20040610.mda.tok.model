the increases were primarily attributable to volume increases  due in part to favorable summer weather conditions 
industrial segment sales were flat as the combination of an approximately increase in caustic soda volumes sold and an increase in caustic soda selling price that increased sales by approximately was offset by a decrease in sales to customers in the telecommunication and circuit board industries 
for the six month transitional period ended march   sales for the industrial segment were  and for the water treatment segment were  the decrease in sales in comparison to the fiscal year ended march  was due to a difference in period lengths and the seasonal nature of the water treatment segment s business  as its sales during april through september are greater than its sales during october through march 
for the fiscal year ended september   sales for the industrial segment were  and for the water treatment segment were  the decrease in sales for the six month transitional period ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  was due to the difference in the length of periods compared and to the seasonal nature of the water treatment segment s business as mentioned above 
gross margin gross margin  as a percentage of sales  was for the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the fiscal year ended march  and was and for the six month transitional period ended march  and the fiscal year ended september   respectively 
the gross margin variations are due to a number of variables as explained below 
industrial segment gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the industrial segment was for the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the fiscal year ended march  and was and for the six month transitional period ended march  and the fiscal year ended september   respectively 
the decrease for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  relates in part to changes in the cost and selling price of caustic soda during these periods and to the high level of high cost inventory on hand at the end of the fiscal year s barge shipping season october 
a highly competitive market environment resulted in an increase of approximately  in product costs that the company was unable to pass on to its customers 
also  insurance expense increased by approximately  or and employee compensation and benefits increased by approximately  or 
the increases over the previous periods in the fiscal year ended march  and the six month transitional period ended march  are mainly due to improved margins in most product lines and to fluctuations in the cost and selling price of caustic soda 
during calendar  the cost of caustic soda was increasing and continued to increase through the end of the fiscal year 
due to the large quantities of caustic soda inventory that are maintained to meet customer requirements and because the company is on the last in  first out lifo method of valuing inventories  any cost fluctuations can impact gross margins 
the company attempts to maintain relatively constant dollar margins as the cost of caustic soda increases or decreases 
the cost of this product is normally subject to fluctuations  which are expected to continue in future periods 
by maintaining relatively stable dollar margins  the gross margin percentage will decrease when the cost of the product is increasing and will increase when the cost of the product is decreasing 
water treatment segment gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the water treatment segment was for the fiscal year ended march   for the fiscal year ended march   for the six month transitional period ended march   and for the fiscal year ended september  the fiscal year ended march  was comparable with the fiscal year ended march  as the increase in sales  due primarily to favorable weather  was offset by higher operating costs

the gross margin increase for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the six month transitional period ended march  was due to the fiscal year end change and to the seasonal nature of the water treatment segment 
during the months of april to september  the sales for this segment are greater and have higher profit margins than the sales for october to march 
additionally  there are certain fixed costs included in cost of sales that do not fluctuate with sales volumes 
the decrease for the six month transitional period ended march  in comparison to the fiscal year ended september  was due to the aforementioned fiscal year end change and the seasonality of the water treatment segment 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  were  for the fiscal year ended march   for the fiscal year ended march   for the six month transitional period ended march   and for the fiscal year ended september  the increase for the fiscal year ended march  was partially attributable to  in consulting fees associated with the company s efforts to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act and to the company s evaluation and investment in an enterprise resource planning system 
the company will continue to incur additional expenses  including expenses for additional staffing and outside professional services  to implement the enterprise resource planning system and meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act

investment income investment income increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  the increase was attributable to an increase in cash available for investment and to a  loss recognized in the fiscal year ended march  due to declines in market value on investments which were deemed other than temporary 
investment income of  for the six month transitional period ended march  was lower than the fiscal year ended march  due to less cash available for investment and the aforementioned change in our fiscal year end that resulted in the six month transitional period 
investment income for the fiscal year ended march  was comparable to the fiscal year ended september   excluding the aforementioned  loss  as the increased amounts of cash available for investment during the fiscal year ended march  were offset by a lower rate of return

the increase in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the six month transitional period ended march  was due primarily to the timing of defined contribution retirement plan payments and the increase in net income due to the six month period  which was offset by fluctuations in inventory values and quantities 
the decrease in the six month transitional period ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended september  was due primarily to fluctuations in inventory and timing of liability payments and a decrease in net income due to the six month period 
cash and investments available for sale of  at march  was comparable with the  available as of march  and increased by  since march   primarily because of cash generated by operations in excess of capital expenditures and financing uses 
cash and investments available for sale increased by  from september  to  at the end of the six month transitional period ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to cash generated by operations in excess of capital expenditures and financing uses and the maturity of investments classified as investments held to maturity  which were invested in available for sale investments 
cash equivalents consist of money market accounts at a financial institution 
investments consist of investment contracts with high rated  stable insurance companies  marketable securities consisting of variable rate municipal bonds  us government agency securities and mutual funds carried at fair value

subsequent to march  a significant portion of the cash equivalents were invested in the aforementioned investment options 
as of march   the company had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of  and mutual funds of  excluding  classified as cash and cash equivalents and variable rate securities 
the fixed income securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
however  while the value of the investment may fluctuate in any given period  the company intends to hold its fixed income investments until maturity 
consequently  the company would not expect to recognize an adverse impact on net income or cash flows or the amount ultimately realized on the investment 
the value of the mutual funds  like all mutual funds  may increase or decrease due to market volatility 
the company recorded a loss of  in the fiscal year ended march  due to declines in market value that were deemed other than temporary 
capital expenditures capital expenditures in the fiscal years ended march  and march   the six month transitional period ended march   and the fiscal year ended september  were    and  respectively 
capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended march  consisted primarily of  for office furniture and equipment which includes approximately  for software and hardware data processing equipment   for machinery and equipment   for land  buildings and improvements  and  for transportation equipment

the company does not purchase  or commit to purchase  quantities in excess of normal usage or amounts that cannot be used within one year 
outlook expected future cash flows from operations  coupled with the company s strong financial position  put the company in a position to fund both short and long term working capital and capital investment needs with internally generated funds 
management does not  therefore  anticipate the need to engage in significant financing activities in either the short or long term 
if the need to obtain additional capital does arise  however  management is confident that the company s total debt to capital ratio puts it in a position to obtain debt financing on favorable terms 
the company will continue to incur significant expenditures in fiscal associated with the implementation of the enterprise resource planning system and to meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
fiscal expenses  including additional staffing and outside professional services  are expected to significantly exceed the additional fiscal expense of approximately  although management continually reviews opportunities to enhance the value of the company through strategic acquisitions  other capital investments and strategic divestitures  no material commitments for such investments or divestitures currently exist
