overview we are a global  research based specialty pharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products 
we currently generate sales in markets throughout the world 
product revenues accounted for approximately and of our total revenues from continuing operations in and  respectively 
our top products and seven global brands contributed approximately of product revenues in and we generate royalty revenues from the sale of ribavirin by schering plough and roche 
royalty revenues accounted for and of our total revenues from continuing operations in and  respectively 
based on this research and development capability and a worldwide capacity to commercialize our products  we have become a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on neurology  dermatology and infectious disease 
we have undergone significant changes in our leadership  strategic direction and operations in the past two years 
in an effort to drive change  our shareholders elected new directors at two successive annual meetings  resulting in a new board composition and the appointment of a new senior management team 
the new board and management team conducted a comprehensive review of our operations and business plan 
based on this review  management developed a strategic plan to transform and grow our business 
this plan included  divesting businesses that do not fit our strategic growth plans  emphasizing and expanding our specialty pharmaceutical business  bringing our overall cost structure in line or better than industry averages and building our pipeline of new products 
divestiture of non core businesses 
as a result of the strategic review  we made the decision to divest our russian pharmaceuticals segment  biomedicals segment  photonics business  raw materials business and manufacturing capability in central europe and circe unit 
the results of these operations and the related financial position have been reflected as discontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the discontinued operations presentation for all historical periods presented 
in june  we sold our russian pharmaceuticals segment and certain assets of our biomedicals segment 
we received gross proceeds of  in cash for the russian pharmaceuticals segment and received  shares of our common stock held by the purchaser  which had a fair market value of approximately  for the assets of our biomedicals segment 
we recorded a net loss on disposal of discontinued operations of  net of a tax benefit of  related to the sale of these businesses in the year ended december  on september   we sold the remaining assets of our biomedicals segment  dosimetry  for gross cash proceeds of  we recorded a net gain on disposal of discontinued operations of  net of taxes of  related to the sale of dosimetry in the year ended december  
table of contents we disposed of the circe unit in the fourth quarter of for a nominal sales price 
we are actively marketing for sale the raw materials businesses and manufacturing capability in hungary and the czech republic and are working toward disposition of these assets 
global manufacturing strategy 
in october  we announced a global manufacturing strategy under which we expect to establish a global manufacturing and supply chain network of five manufacturing site down from our current sites 
with respect to the manufacturing sites identified for disposal  a review for potential asset impairment was performed in accordance with sfas no 
 impairment of long lived assets 
in determining asset groups  we grouped assets at the lowest level for which independent identifiable cash flows were available 
in determining whether an asset was impaired  we compared undiscounted future cash flows and asset residual values to the asset group carrying value on a site by site basis 
the impairment analysis indicated that the asset groups were not impaired as of december   therefore  no impairment losses were recognized in the fourth quarter of based on the estimated remaining useful lives of the manufacturing sites to be disposed of  the book value would exceed the residual value on the estimated disposal date for five of the manufacturing sites 
as a result  we have revised the depreciation period on these assets and will incur an additional annual depreciation expense of approximately  through the third quarter of we are actively marketing the manufacturing sites planned to be eliminated from our operations 
our intention is to sell each site as an operating plant  including both assets and employee obligations 
however  we may not find buyers for all of the manufacturing sites 
additionally  as we identify opportunities to create near term value in the sites designated for disposal  we may incur cash expenditures related to severance charges and other costs in disposing of these manufacturing sites 
we have not determined  at this time  what these cash costs would be  if any 
ribapharm acquisition 
as part of our overall restructuring strategy  we evaluated growth opportunities for our specialty pharmaceutical business including our pipeline of new products 
we determined that a successful specialty pharmaceutical company needed research and development capacity to develop a pipeline of new products 
we evaluated the ownership structure of ribapharm on whether they would meet our research and development needs 
we determined that the benefits perceived at the time of the initial public offering of ribapharm had diminished and that the potential advantages to us of repurchasing the publicly held shares of ribapharm outweighed the advantages of continuing to maintain ribapharm as a separate publicly traded entity or completing a spin off of ribapharm 
in august  we repurchased the minority interest in ribapharm for an aggregate total purchase price of  we paid in cash for each of the  outstanding publicly held shares of ribapharm 
through this transaction  we have secured control over ribapharm s research and development assets and royalty revenue stream 
inventory reduction 
as a result of the change in management in the second quarter of  we changed our policy regarding inventory levels at our wholesalers 
prior to the change in management  our policy was to retain high inventories at the wholesaler level in the united states to avoid the possibility of stock outs 
after the change in management  we changed our policy to maintain minimum levels of inventory at or better than industry averages 
the new policy reflects our confidence in meeting demand through improved manufacturing and overall logistics performance and improves the price competitiveness of our products 
the result of this decision was a significant reduction in sales in the united states market until inventory levels were reduced 
this effort began in may and was completed in april trends in north america sales are partially masked by the effect of this inventory reduction 
hiring of new management team 
since june  we have put in place new leadership with extensive experience in the pharmaceuticals and healthcare sectors 
we have replaced our chairman and chief executive officer  chief operating officer and chief financial officer 
additionally  we have replaced or hired new individuals for a majority of our senior management positions 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  collectibility of receivables  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales when the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer 
revenues are recorded net of provisions for rebates  discounts and returns  which are established at the time of sale 
allowances for future returns of products sold to our direct and indirect customers  who include wholesalers  retail pharmacies and hospitals  are calculated as a percent of sales based on historical return percentages 
adjustments are made to the accrual based upon estimated inventory levels  expiration dating  and product demand at our major wholesalers 
actual results could be different from our estimates resulting in future adjustments to revenue 
we conduct a review of the current methodology and assess the adequacy of the allowance for returns on a quarterly basis  adjusting for changes in assumptions  historical results and business practices  as necessary 
income taxes we operate in numerous countries where our income tax returns are subject to audit 
internal and external tax professionals are employed to minimize tax audit adjustments where possible 
we consider the expected outcome of these audits in the calculation of our tax provision 
we assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize the tax benefits associated with our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet this criteria 
a significant amount of judgment is used in this process  including preparation of forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives 
if we revise these forecasts or determine that certain planning events will not occur  an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made to tax expense in the period such determination is made 
valuation of intangible assets we periodically review intangible assets for impairment using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
we determine whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future operating income of the product line with its carrying value 
if the undiscounted operating income is less than the carrying value  the amount of the impairment  if any  will be determined by comparing the value of each intangible asset with its fair value 
fair value is generally based on a discounted cash flows analysis 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets acquired and for the assessment of impairment 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
we evaluated the businesses included in discontinued operations by comparing the carrying value of each intangible asset to their fair value  as determined using discounted cash flows analysis  appraisals  and purchase offers 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
any changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 

table of contents purchase price allocation including acquired in process research and development the purchase price for ribapharm was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
additionally  estimates for the purchase price allocation may change as subsequent information becomes available 
we value in process research and development ipr d acquired in a business combination based on an approach consistent with the aicpa practice aid  assets acquired in business combinations to be used in research and development activities a focus in software  electronic devices and pharmaceutical industries 
the amount expensed as acquired ipr d represents an estimate of the fair value of purchased in process technology for projects that  as of the acquisition date  had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the data used to determine the respective fair values requires significant judgment and differences in those judgments would have the impact of changing the allocation of purchase price to goodwill  which is an unamortizable intangible asset 
the estimated fair value of these projects was based on our use of a discounted cash flow model based on an estimate of future sales and an average gross margin of 
for each project  the estimated after tax cash flows using a tax rate of were probability weighted to take account of the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization 
the assumed tax rate of is our estimate of the effective tax rate for acquisitions of similar types of assets 
these cash flows were then discounted to a present value using a discount rate of 
in addition  for the purposes of estimating the fair value of these ipr d projects as of august   we made the following assumptions future research and development costs of approximately  would be incurred to complete the ipr d projects 
the ipr d projects  which are in various stages of development form phase to phase clinical trials  are expected to reach completion by the end of the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects include the uncertainty of our ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from clinical trials and of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions we used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of these projects will materialize as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary significantly from the estimated results 
for example  in october  roche notified us that they are abandoning development of levovirin  a clinical candidate for the treatment of hepatitis c 
contingencies we are exposed to contingencies in the ordinary course of business  such as legal proceedings and business related claims  which range from product and environmental liabilities to tax matters 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we record accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information is known 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies 
results of operations certain financial information for our business segments is set forth below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 

table of contents we have four reportable pharmaceutical segments comprising our pharmaceutical operations in north america  latin america  europe and asia  africa and australia 
in addition  we have a research and development division formerly ribapharm

revenue in thousands pharmaceuticals north america latin america europe asia  africa  australia total pharmaceuticals royalties total revenues cost of goods sold gross profit margin on product sales year ended december  compared to pharmaceutical revenues overall  we experienced an increase in sales of pharmaceutical products of  for the year ended december  over the same period in foreign currency contributed  on a net basis to the increase in overall product sales primarily due to the increase in the value of the euro over the us dollar 
sales from our seven global brands increased  for the year ended december  over the same period in  with of this increase being attributed to increased sales of mestinon worldwide 
generic competition entered the market in against mestinon in the united states  but we continue to benefit by patent protection in europe and the rest of the world 
over the next several years we expect to see industry level growth of between and percent per year in pharmaceutical revenues excluding increases due to product acquisitions 
we expect to see continued generic and other competition against our products in and beyond and we expect to see continued pricing challenges through price controls in europe and the rest of the world as governments take steps to reduce their overall costs of healthcare 
in our north america pharmaceuticals segment  revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period of  an increase of  
the increase is primarily due to the completion of an inventory reduction program at our wholesalers in  which we began in june and completed in april this resulted in higher sales volume  especially in dermatological products and mestinon 
the growth in revenues is also attributable to product price increases in the us in our latin america pharmaceuticals segment  revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period of  an increase of  revenues in latin america were affected by an decrease in the value of currencies in the region aggregating  excluding the impact of currencies compared to the us dollar  revenues in latin america increased by  with approximately of the increase being due to price increases throughout the region 
additionally  revenues in benefited by volume increases in various products 
in our europe pharmaceuticals segment  revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period of  an increase of  
the increase in the value of currencies in the region as compared to the us dollar contributed  to the increase in revenues in the region

table of contents poland increased  and revenues in spain increased  primarily due to price increases and new product launches 
revenues in were negatively affected by the impact of german health care reform  reference pricing litigation in spain and price controls in italy 
in our asia  africa and australia  or aaa  pharmaceuticals segment  revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period of  an increase of  revenues in aaa were affected by an increase in the value of currencies in the region of  offset by lower sales volume in several products including fefol  coracten and reptilase 
reptilase sales were negatively impacted by licensing and renewal issues  which were resolved in the fourth quarter of royalties royalty revenues in and represent amounts earned under the license and supply agreement with schering plough  and for fiscal  under a license agreement with roche in addition to the license and supply agreement with schering plough 
under the license and supply agreement  schering plough licensed all oral forms of ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
in january  we reached an agreement with roche on a settlement of pending patent disputes over roche s combination antiviral product containing roche s version of ribavirin  known as copegus 
under the agreement  roche may continue to register and commercialize copegus globally 
the financial terms of this settlement agreement include a license by us of ribavirin to roche 
the license authorizes roche to make or have made and to sell copegus under our patents in combination with interferon alfa or pegylated interferon alfa 
roche pays royalty fees to us on all sales of copegus for use in combination with interferon alfa or pegylated interferon alfa 
royalties for the year ended december  from schering plough and roche were  compared to  for the same period of  a decrease of  
the decrease in royalties include the effects of increasing competition between schering plough and roche  and schering plough s provision for estimated rebates on its us sales of ribavirin and changes in trade inventory levels as reported to us by schering plough 
we expected to also experience the impact of generic competition in the united states during the last half of  but the us food and drug administration fda did not grant approval for generic entrants by the year end 
we continue to believe that approval of a generic form of oral ribavirin is imminent in the us and that the impact of this approval will be a continued erosion of the royalty amount from sales in the united states 
royalties from sales of oral ribavirin outside the united states represent over half of total royalties for the year ended december  gross profit gross profit on product sales decreased to for the year ended december  compared to in the decrease in gross profit is primarily due to costs related to our manufacturing rationalization project incurred in these costs reflect the impact of accelerated depreciation charges of  and severance charges of  associated with the rationalization effort 
selling expenses selling expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in  an increase of

table of contents  costs incurred in the proxy contest  and environmental related expenses 
the remaining decrease of  reflects a reduction in corporate general and administrative expenses of  which is mainly attributable to a decrease in legal expenses in and expenses incurred in the year ended december  related to severance costs  stock compensation and other charges other than those described above 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase of  in ribapharm s general and administrative expenses partially related to legal and professional fees incurred by ribapharm in connection with the ribapharm acquisition 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period in the decrease is primarily attributable to the timing of costs associated with the clinical trials of viramidine and remofovir formerly referred to as hepavir b 
it is expected that research and development expenses will increase significantly in and into as we have initiated phase studies in parallel with the completion of phase studies of viramidine and progress continues with the clinical trials of remofovir 
acquired in process research and development in the year ended december   we incurred an expense of  associated with ipr d related to the ribapharm acquisition that occurred in august the amount expensed as ipr d represents our estimate of the fair value of purchased in process technology for projects that  as of the acquisition date  had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use

the convertible note hedge is intended to reduce the potential dilution from conversion on  principal amount of the and notes by effectively increasing the conversion price per share to 
on november   we used proceeds from the offering to retire  aggregate principal amount of our notes 
on december   we issued  aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes for net proceeds of  interest on the notes is payable semi annually on june and december of each year 
the indenture governing the notes include certain covenants which may restrict the incurrence of additional indebtedness  the payment of dividends and other restricted payments  the creation of certain liens  the sale of assets or the ability to consolidate or merge with another entity  subject to qualifications and exceptions 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with respect to  principal amount of the notes 
the interest rate on the swap will be variable at libor plus 
the effect of this transaction is to lower our effective rate on that portion outstanding notes 
on a prospective basis  the effective rate will float and correlate to the variable interest earned on our cash held 
we have previously stated that we expect to retain minimum cash levels of between  and  we also expect to further reduce our interest expense in by repurchasing or redeeming the balance of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due by july we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements at least through december   to repurchase the 
table of contents remaining amount of our notes and to fund anticipated acquisitions  capital expenditures and our research and development program 
while we have no current intent to issue additional debt or equity securities  we may also seek additional debt financing or issue additional equity securities to finance future acquisitions 
we fund our cash requirements primarily from cash provided by our operating activities 
our sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalent balances and our cash flow from operations 
in february  we acquired amarin pharmaceuticals  inc and all of its us products from its parent  amarin corporation  plc 
under the terms of the transaction  we paid  in cash at the closing for the rights to amarin s product portfolio  which includes permax and a primary care portfolio with a broad range of indications 
we also acquired in the transaction the rights to zelapar  a late stage candidate for the treatment of parkinson s disease 
amarin has received an approvable letter from the us food and drug administration fda for zelapar  subject to the completion of two safety studies  which amarin will fund and expects to complete in the agreement calls for valeant to make additional milestone payments of up to  to amarin based on the successful completion of the studies and final approval by the fda of zelapar 
in addition  valeant will make a milestone payment of  to the developer of zelapar upon the attainment of specified sales thresholds 
competition from generic pharmaceutical companies could have a material negative impact on our future royalty revenue 
with respect to schering plough  royalties will be affected by the likelihood of reduced sales by schering plough as well as a reduction in the effective royalty rate per the license agreement 
with respect to roche  under the license agreement  introduction of generics in any market will eliminate the obligation of roche to pay royalties for sales in that market 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements regarding commitments and contingencies generic litigation 
while we have historically paid quarterly cash dividends  there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future 
we evaluate the carrying value of our inventories on a regular basis  taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand  the price we expect to obtain for our products in their respective markets compared with historical cost  and the remaining shelf life of goods on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we also evaluate the collectibility of our receivables on a regular basis 
our methodology for establishing the allowance for bad debts varies with the regions in which we operate 
the allowance for bad debts is based upon specific identification of customer accounts and our best estimate of the likelihood of potential loss  taking into account such factors as the financial condition and payment history of major customers 
as of december   we believe that adequate provision has been made for inventory obsolescence and for anticipated losses on uncollectible accounts receivable 
we currently have no insurance with respect to product liability claims arising in the united states 
while to date no material adverse claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective products has been successfully maintained against us  a substantial claim  if successful  could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial performance 
we have in place worldwide clinical trial insurance 
in february  we acquired from amarin corporation  plc its us based subsidiary  amarin pharmaceuticals  inc and all of its us product rights 
one of the products purchased is subject to settled and pending product liability litigation 
in connection with the acquisition  we acquired product liability insurance for this product  which we will continue to provide for

products in development we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future  of which a large percentage will be to support the continuing product development programs for viramidine and remofovir formerly referred to as hepavir b 
we expect that for  we will spend approximately to million on the product development programs for viramidine and remofovir 
for viramidine  we are in the process of conducting a phase study of patients 
this study began in and will continue into the study included an interim analysis performed on the first patients who received at least weeks of therapy 
in the second half of  protocols for two phase viramidine studies were developed 
we decided to initiate the phase studies of viramidine  prior to the completion of the phase clinical trials 
each of the two phase studies will be conducted on a global basis  and will consist of approximately investigator sites and approximately  enrolled patients 
the studies will compare viramidine and ribavirin  each in conjunction with a pegylated interferon 
the first of the two global studies  known as viser  began enrollment in the fourth quarter of the second study  known as viser  is expected to begin in the second half of our external research and development expenses for viramidine were approximately  from inception through december  for remofovir  we have completed two phase clinical trials in healthy volunteers 
remofovir is currently being evaluated in a third phase study  which is structured as a day  randomized  placebo controlled  double blind  dose escalation clinical trial in up to hepatitis b patients in the us the results of this us phase study are expected in early further  a fourth phase multiple dose study in taiwan completed enrollment in january a week dose ranging phase study is expected to begin in asia in the second quarter of our external research and development expenses for remofovir were approximately  including a milestone payment of  from inception through december  
table of contents foreign operations approximately and of our revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  and  respectively  were generated from operations outside the united states 
all our foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad 
see risk factors 
inflation and changing prices we experience the effects of inflation through increases in the costs of labor  services and raw materials 
we are subject to price control restrictions on our pharmaceutical products in the majority of countries in which we operate 
while we attempt to raise selling prices in anticipation of inflation  we operate in some markets which have price controls that may limit our ability to raise prices in a timely fashion 
future sales and gross profit will be reduced if we are unable to obtain price increases commensurate with the levels of inflation

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets 
we evaluate our exposure to such risks on an ongoing basis  and review our risk management policy to manage these risks to an acceptable level  based on our judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
we do not hold any significant amount of market risk sensitive instruments whose value is subject to market price risk 
our significant foreign currency exposure relates to the euro  the mexican peso  the polish zloty  the swiss franc and the canadian dollar 
we seek to manage our foreign currency exposure by maintaining the majority of cash balances at foreign subsidiaries in the us dollar and through operational means by managing local currency revenues in relation to local currency costs 
we are currently taking steps to mitigate the impact of foreign currency on the income statement  which include hedging our foreign currency exposure 
in march  we entered into a foreign currency hedge transaction to reduce our exposure to variability in the euro 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk and legal risk and are not discussed or quantified in the following analysis 
interest rate and currency risks we currently do not hold financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our financial assets are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to their short duration 
at december   we had  of foreign denominated variable rate debt that would subject us to both interest rate and currency risks 
as of december   we do not use any derivatives or similar instruments to manage our interest rate or currency risk 
subsequent to year end  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with respect to  principal amount of the notes 
a basis point increase in interest rates affecting our financial instruments would have an immaterial effect on our year end pretax earnings 
in addition  we currently have  of fixed rate debt that require us dollar repayment 
to the extent that we require  as a source of debt repayment  earnings and cash flow from some of our units located in foreign countries  we are subject to the risk of changes in the value of certain currencies relative to the us dollar 
however  the increase of a basis point in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments by approximately  as of december

the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in this report as a result of various factors  including those set forth below 
if we cannot successfully develop or obtain future products  our growth may be delayed 
our future growth will depend  in large part  upon our ability to develop or obtain and commercialize new products and new formulations of  or indications for  current products 
we are engaged in an active research and development program involving compounds owned by us or licensed from others which we may commercially develop in the future 
the process of successfully commercializing products is time consuming  expensive and unpredictable 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or acquire new products  obtain regulatory approvals to use these products for proposed or new clinical indications  manufacture our potential products in compliance with regulatory requirements or in commercial volumes  or gain market acceptance for such products 
it may be necessary for us to enter into other licensing arrangements  similar to our arrangements with schering plough and f 
hoffman laroche ltd  or roche  with other pharmaceutical companies in order to market effectively any new products or new indications for existing products 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into such licensing arrangements on terms favorable to us or at all 
on november   we announced that we were commencing phase clinical trials of viramidine 
there can be no assurance that our clinical trials for viramidine will be successful  that we will be granted approval to market viramidine for the indication we are seeking or that viramidine will be a commercially successful product 
additionally  there is the potential for product liability claims from patients participating in the clinical trials in the event a participant is harmed by the product 
we currently maintain clinical trial insurance 
there is no assurance  however  that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all claims 
likelihood of imminent introduction of generic products puts ribavirin royalties at risk and may impact our ability to finance research and development activities 
royalty revenues earned under our ribavirin license agreements with schering plough and roche represent an important source of revenues to us 
schering plough markets ribavirin for use in combination with its interferon product under the trade name rebetol as a therapy for the treatment of hepatitis c  and roche markets ribavirin for use in combination with its interferon product under the name copegus 
under the terms of their license agreements  schering plough and roche each have sole discretion to determine the pricing of ribavirin and the amount and timing of resources devoted to their respective marketing of ribavirin 
competition from generic pharmaceutical companies could have a material negative impact on our future royalty revenue 
with respect to schering plough  royalties will be affected by the likelihood of reduced sales by schering plough as well as a reduction in the effective royalty rate per the license agreement 
with respect 
table of contents to roche  under the license agreement  introduction of generics in any market will eliminate the obligation of roche to pay royalties for net sales in that market 
our research and development activities are largely funded by the royalties received from schering plough and roche 
three generic pharmaceutical companies filed abbreviated new drug applications  or andas  with the fda to market generic forms of ribavirin for use as part of a combination therapy for the treatment of hepatitis c 
we commenced litigation to prevent the marketing of a generic form of ribavirin in the us district court for the central district of california 
in july  the court issued a memorandum of decision and order granting the defendants their motion for summary judgment of non infringement of the asserted patents in the suit brought by us 
this decision did not rule on the motion for summary judgment that the patents are invalid 
this ruling permits the fda to approve these generic companies andas  in their discretion 
given the current status of filings with the fda  including pending generic drug applications and a related citizen petition submitted by ribapharm challenging those applications  generic competition in the us may be imminent 
additionally  our royalty revenues have declined during due to increasing competition between schering plough and roche  schering plough s provision for estimated rebates on its us sales of ribavirin and changes in trade inventory levels 
we expect this revenue trend to continue prior to the introduction of generic competition for the sale of ribavirin in the us although our financial planning has included an expectation that generic competition for ribavirin in the us would  a greater than expected erosion of royalties from the us  or a significant decrease in royalties from expected levels for markets other than the us  could require us to reduce research and development expenditures and other activities 
various parties are opposing ribapharm s ribavirin patents in actions before the european patent office  and ribapharm is responding to these oppositions 
while data exclusivity for the combination therapies marketed by schering plough and roche is scheduled to continue in the major markets of the european union until for schering plough and for roche  regulatory approvals and schemes may change and or studies regarding ribavirin in combination with interferon may be replicated  allowing earlier introduction of generics into such markets 
if our focus on the development of viramidine does not result in an approved and commercially successful product  our business could be adversely affected 
we focus our research and development activities on areas in which we have particular strengths  particularly antivirals 
the outcome of any development program is highly uncertain 
although viramidine appears promising and has advanced to phase clinical trials  it may yet fail to yield a commercial product 
success in preclinical and early stage clinical trials may not necessarily translate into success in large scale clinical trials 
further  to be successful in clinical trials  increased investment will be necessary  which will adversely affect short term profitability 
in addition  we will need to obtain and maintain regulatory approval in order to market viramidine 
even if viramidine appears promising in large scale phase clinical trials  regulatory approval may not be achieved 
the results of clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent approval or result in the need for post marketing studies 
in addition  changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and fda review of a new application may cause delays or rejection 
even if we receive regulatory approval  this approval may include limitations on the indications for which we can market the product 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to satisfy the needed regulatory requirements  and we may suffer a significant variation from planned revenue as a result 
third parties may be able to sell generic forms of our products or block our sales of our products if our intellectual property rights or data exclusivity rights do not sufficiently protect us  patent rights of third parties may also be asserted against us 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful exclusivity protection for our products and product candidates throughout the world via patent protection and or data exclusivity 
table of contents protection 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we will be able to protect our products from generic substitution by third parties only to the extent that our technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents  effectively maintained as trade secrets or are protected by data exclusivity 
however  our currently pending or future patent applications may not issue as patents 
any patent issued may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
furthermore  our patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing generic substitutes for our products 
lastly  data exclusivity schemes vary from country to country and may be limited or eliminated as governments seek to reduce pharmaceutical costs by increasing the speed and ease of approval of generic products 
in order to protect or enforce patent and or data exclusivity rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties  and we may be similarly sued by others 
we may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions 
the defense and prosecution  if necessary  of intellectual property and data exclusivity actions are costly and divert technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities 
we may not prevail in any of these suits 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings  resulting in a finding of non infringement or invalidity of our patents  or a lack of protection via data exclusivity  may allow entry of generic substitutes for our products 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with such litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during such litigation 
in addition  during the course of this kind of litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial negative effect on the trading price of our securities 
ribapharm s patents in the us are the subject of litigation  and the most recent ruling by the court in the ribavirin related litigation with generic drug companies was not in our favor 
see likelihood of imminent introduction of generic products puts ribavirin royalties at risk and may impact our ability to finance research and development activities  above 
ribapharm has limited patent rights in selected countries of the european union  switzerland and japan relating to the antiviral use of ribavirin 
these patents are currently scheduled to expire by  although ribapharm is seeking to extend these patents until ribapharm may not be able to have these patents extended 
the existence of a patent will not necessarily protect us from competition 
competitors may successfully challenge our patents  produce similar drugs that do not infringe our patents or produce drugs in countries that do not respect our patents 
no patent can protect its holder from a claim of infringement of another patent 
therefore  our patent position cannot and does not provide an assurance that the manufacture  sale or use of products patented by us could not infringe a patent right of another 
while we know of no actual or threatened claim of infringement that would be material to us  there can be no assurance that such a claim will not be asserted 
if such a claim is asserted  there can be no assurance that the resolution of the claim would permit us to continue producing the relevant product on commercially reasonable terms 
obtaining necessary government approvals is time consuming and not assured 
fda approval must be obtained in the us and approval must be obtained from comparable agencies in other countries prior to marketing or manufacturing new pharmaceutical products for use by humans 
obtaining fda approval for new products and manufacturing processes can take a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
numerous requirements must be satisfied  including preliminary testing programs on animals and subsequent clinical testing programs on humans  to establish product safety and efficacy 
no assurance can be given that we will obtain approval in the us  or any other 
table of contents country  of any application we may submit for the commercial sale of a new or existing drug or compound 
nor can any assurance be given that if such approval is secured  the approved labeling will not have significant labeling limitations that could affect profitability  or that those drugs or compounds will be commercially successful 
the fda and other regulatory agencies in other countries also periodically inspect manufacturing facilities both in the us and abroad 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  warning letters  sanctions  fines  delays or suspensions of approvals  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions  manufacturing interruptions  costly corrective actions  injunctions  adverse publicity against us and our products  refusal to renew marketing applications  and criminal prosecutions 
furthermore  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could prevent or delay us from obtaining future regulatory approvals or jeopardize existing approvals 
difficulties with acquisitions could materially impact our future growth 
we intend to pursue a strategy of targeted expansion through the acquisition of compatible businesses and product lines and the formation of strategic alliances  joint ventures and other business combinations 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete or finance any future acquisition or investment or that any acquisitions that we do complete will be completed at prices or on terms that prove to be advantageous to us 
the success or failure in integrating the operations of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may have a material impact on our future growth and success 
if competitors develop vaccines or more effective or less costly drugs for our target indications  our business could be seriously harmed 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
ribavirin and many of the drugs that we are attempting to discover will be competing with new and existing therapies 
many companies in the us and abroad are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting 
for example  in december  roche received approval to sell copegus  its version of ribavirin 
in addition  human genome sciences  inc submitted an investigational new drug application with the fda in october to initiate phase human clinical trials of albuferon for treatment of hepatitis c 
if albuferon or other therapies that do not incorporate the use of our products prove to be a more effective treatment for hepatitis c than the combination therapy involving ribavirin  then our royalty revenues from ribavirin could significantly decrease 
in addition  there are institutions engaged in research on the development of a vaccine to prevent hepatitis c 
the availability of such a vaccine could have a material adverse effect on our revenues from sales of products treating hepatitis c 
many of our competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical companies  have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than we do 
we believe that many of our competitors spend significantly more on research and development related activities than we do 
others may succeed in developing products that are more effective than those currently marketed or proposed for development by us 
progress by other researchers in areas similar to those being explored by us may result in further competitive challenges 
in addition  academic institutions  government agencies  and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products 
they may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors 
competing therapies in development may include infergen being developed by amgen  inc and intermune  omega interferon being developed by biomedicines  thymosin alfa being developed by sciclone pharmaceuticals  inc  albuferon being developed by human genome sciences  inc  and 
table of contents protease inhibitors being developed by boehringer ingelheim  eli lilly and company  vertex pharmaceuticals incorporated  viropharma incorporated  wyeth and gilead sciences  inc other companies that engage in research activities similar to our and ribapharm s research activities include abbott laboratories  pfizer  inc  glaxosmithkline plc  merck co  inc and novartis ag 
if our products are alleged to be harmful  we may not be able to sell them and we may be subject to product liability claims not covered by insurance 
the nature of our business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
using our drug candidates in clinical trials may expose us to product liability claims 
these risks will expand with respect to drugs  if any  that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
even if a drug were approved for commercial use by an appropriate governmental agency  there can be no assurance that users will not claim that effects other than those intended may result from our products 
while to date no material adverse claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective products  including ribavirin  has been successfully maintained against us  a substantial claim  if successful  could have a material negative impact on us 
in the event that anyone alleges that any of our products are harmful  we may experience reduced consumer demand for our products or our products may be recalled from the market 
in addition  we may be forced to defend lawsuits and  if unsuccessful  to pay a substantial amount in damages 
we do not currently have insurance against product liability risks for commercially developed products 
insurance is expensive and  if we seek such insurance in the future  it may not be available on acceptable terms 
even if obtained  insurance may not fully protect us against potential product liability claims 
we are involved in various legal proceedings that could adversely affect us 
we are involved in several legal proceedings  including those described in note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are subject to a settlement agreement with the securities and exchange commission 
we are subject to the provisions of a settlement agreement with the securities and exchange commission  which arose from a civil complaint brought against us by the commission 
as a result of the settlement  we cannot take advantage of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of and  therefore  may be hindered in the defense of any future allegations 
our flexibility in maximizing commercialization opportunities for our compounds may be limited by our obligations to schering plough 
in november  we entered into an agreement that provides schering plough with an option to acquire the rights to up to three of our products that they designate at an early stage of product development and a right for first last refusal to license various compounds we may develop and elect to license to others 
viramidine was not subject to the option of schering plough  but it would be subject to their right of first last refusal if we elected to license it to a third party 
the interest of potential collaborators in obtaining rights to our compounds or the terms of any agreements we ultimately enter into for these rights may be impacted by our agreement with schering plough 
a commercialization partner other than schering plough might have otherwise been preferable due to that potential partner s strength in a given disease area or geographic region or for other reasons 
we are subject to uncertainty related to health care reform measures and reimbursement policies 
the levels at which government authorities  private health insurers  hmos and other organizations reimburse the costs of drugs and treatments related to those drugs will have an effect on the successful commercialization of our drug candidates 
we cannot be sure that reimbursement in the us or elsewhere 
table of contents will be available for any drugs we may develop or  if already available  will not be decreased in the future 
also  we cannot be sure that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for  or the price of  our drugs 
if reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels  we may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on the manufacture and commercialization of any future drugs 
in addition  as a result of the trend towards managed health care in the us  as well as legislative proposals to reduce government insurance programs  third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drug products 
consequently  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
third party payors may not establish and maintain price levels sufficient for us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
dependence on key personnel leaves us vulnerable to a negative impact if they leave 
we believe that our continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of the key members of management 
the loss of their services could have a negative impact on us 
in addition  ribapharm depends upon the principal members of its scientific staff 
ribapharm s success depends upon its ability to attract  train  motivate and retain qualified scientific personnel 
qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries 
we may not be able to attract additional personnel or retain existing employees 
our third party manufacturers failure to comply with fda regulations could cause interruption of the manufacture of our products 
our manufacturers are required to adhere to regulations enforced by the fda and similar regulatory agencies in other countries 
our dependence upon others to manufacture our products may adversely affect our profit margins and our ability to develop and commercialize products on a timely and competitive basis 
delays or difficulties with contract manufacturers in producing  packaging or distributing our products could adversely affect the sales of our current products or introduction of other products 
schering plough manufactures and sells ribavirin under license from us 
in february  schering plough announced that the fda has been conducting inspections of schering plough s manufacturing facility in las piedras  puerto rico that manufactures ribavirin  and has issued reports citing deficiencies concerning compliance with current good manufacturing practices  primarily relating to production processes  controls and procedures 
in june  schering plough announced that fda inspections at this and one other schering plough facility in may and june cited continuing and additional deficiencies in manufacturing practices 
in may  schering plough signed a consent decree of permanent injunction with the fda  agreeing to measures to assure that the drug products manufactured at their puerto rico plant are made in compliance with fda s current good manufacturing practice regulations 
while schering plough has advised us that the deficiencies were not specifically applicable to the production of ribavirin  the consent decree covers the facility producing ribavirin 
schering plough s ability to manufacture and ship ribavirin could be affected by temporary interruption of some production lines to install system upgrades and further enhance compliance  and other technical production and equipment qualification issues 
if the fda is not satisfied with schering plough s compliance under the consent decree  the fda could take further regulatory actions against schering plough  including the seizure of products  an injunction against further manufacture  a product recall or other actions that could interrupt production of ribavirin 
interruption of ribavirin production for a sustained period of time could materially reduce our royalty receipts 
our business  financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks arising from the international scope of our operations 
we conduct a significant portion of our business outside the us approximately of our revenue was generated outside the us during the year ended december  we sell our pharmaceutical products in countries around the world and employ approximately  individuals in countries other than the us 
table of contents the international scope of our operations may lead to volatile financial results and difficulties in managing our operations because of  but not limited to  the following difficulties and costs of staffing  severance and benefit payments and managing international operations  exchange controls  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws  the geographic  time zone  language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivables in and moving cash out of certain geographic regions  the need for a significant amount of available cash from operations to fund our business in a number of geographic and economically diverse locations  and political  social and economic instability in emerging markets in which we currently operate 
many of our key processes  opportunities and expenses are a function of national and or local government regulation 
significant changes in regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business 
the process by which pharmaceutical products are approved is lengthy and highly regulated 
we have developed expertise in managing this process in the many markets around the world 
our multi year clinical trials programs are planned and executed to conform to these regulations  and once begun  can be difficult and expensive to change should the regulations regarding approval of pharmaceutical products significantly change 
in addition  we depend on patent law and data exclusivity to keep generic products from reaching the market before we have adequately recouped our investment in the discovery and development of our products 
in assessing whether we will invest in any development program  or license a product from a third party  we assess the likelihood of patent and or data exclusivity under the laws and regulations then in effect 
if those schemes significantly change in a large market  or across many smaller markets  our ability to protect our investment may be adversely affected 
appropriate tax planning requires that we consider the current and prevailing national and local tax laws and regulations  as well as international tax treaties and arrangements that we enter into with various government authorities 
changes in national local tax regulations  or changes in political situations may limit or eliminate the effects of our tax planning 
due to the large portion of our business conducted outside the us  we have significant foreign currency risk 
we sell products in many countries that are susceptible to significant foreign currency risk 
in some of these markets we sell products for us dollars 
while this eliminates our direct currency risk in such markets  it increases our credit risk because if a local currency is devalued significantly  it becomes more expensive for customers in that market to purchase our products in us dollars 
as of december  we did not have any third party hedge arrangements to protect against foreign currency exposure 
we continue to evaluate the possibility of entering into arrangements which would result in additional expenditures 
in march  we entered into foreign currency hedge transactions to reduce our exposure to variability in the euro 

table of contents we are subject to price control restrictions on our pharmaceutical products in the majority of countries in which we operate 
there is a risk that other jurisdictions may enact price control restrictions  and that the restrictions that currently exist may be increased 
our future sales and gross profit could be materially affected if we are unable to obtain appropriate price increases 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from the use  storage  handling or disposal of these materials 
in the event of contamination or injury  we could be held liable for damages that result 
any liability could exceed our resources 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products 
the cost of compliance with  or any potential violation of  these laws and regulations could be significant 
any insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses 
our stockholder rights plan and anti takeover provisions of our charter documents could provide our board of directors with the ability to delay or prevent a change in control of us 
our stockholder rights plan  provisions of our certificate of incorporation and provisions of the delaware general corporation law could provide our board of directors with the ability to deter hostile takeovers or delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
we may issue additional equity securities and thereby materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we are authorized to issue  without stockholder approval   shares of preferred stock  none of which were outstanding as of december   in one or more series 
any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights  conversion rights  voting rights  terms of redemption  redemption prices  liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common stock 
our board of directors has no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock  but reserves the right to do so in the future 
in addition  we are authorized to issue up to million shares of our common stock without stockholder approval 
we are also authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock 
if we issue additional equity securities  the price of our securities may be materially and adversely affected 
a number of internal and external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price of our stock to be volatile 
the market prices for securities of companies engaged in pharmaceutical development  including us  have been volatile 
many factors  including many over which we have no control  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including without limitation our competitors announcement of technological innovations or new commercial products  changes in governmental regulation  our competitors receipt of regulatory approvals  our competitors developments relating to patents or proprietary rights  
table of contents publicity regarding actual or potential medical results for products that we or our competitors have under development  and period to period changes in financial results
