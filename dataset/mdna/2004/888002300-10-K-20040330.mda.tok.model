oil and gas reserves at december   the company s total proved gas reserves were estimated to be billion cubic feet bcf  all relating to the comet ridge project in queensland  australia 
as of december   the company had no oil reserves 
proved gas reserves  as defined by sec regulation  are the estimated quantities of natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
accordingly  proved reserves do not reflect potentially higher prices under conditional contract provisions 
using current market product prices in effect at such time and a discount rate of as prescribed by sec regulation  total discounted future after tax net cash flows were estimated to be million as of december   compared to million at december  the net increase was due primarily to the addition of proved undeveloped drilling locations resulting from australian development drilling  the purchase of reserves and the strengthening australian dollar 
increases in future revenues attributed  in part  to the rise in the value of the australian dollar were partially offset by similar foreign currency value changes in operating costs and future development costs 
the elimination of previously booked domestic reserves relating to the company s nine mile project reduced the domestic discounted future net cash flows to zero  a reduction of approximately million 
the present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of the company s proved reserves 
an estimate of the future value would also take into consideration  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing gas 
the company s gas marketing in eastern australia is focused currently on obtaining long term gas sales agreements that provide five to years of firm sales typically starting in to the company s independent engineers estimate that if future gas sales agreements require  comet ridge could be developed so as to deliver over the next years to approximately bcf of the bcf in proved reserves at december  based on contracts and market conditions at year end  the discounted net cash flows of million for the company s proved reserves as of december  reflect management s estimates of reasonably certain sales levels 
these estimates project sales of bcf over the next years  with limited sales growth in the near term  escalating to bcf per annum in the company anticipates spending approximately million over the next three years on development drilling and expansion of delivery facilities to increase the company s annual sales deliverability to bcf net by critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  some of which require management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and also affect the disclosure of contingent items 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting policies that currently affect its financial condition and results of operations 
oil and gas reserves estimated reserve quantities and estimated future development costs are used to calculate the rate at which the company records depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain  and the estimates of future net cash flows and their present values from the company s proved reserves are based upon various assumptions about future production levels and current prices and costs 
any significant variance from the assumptions could result in material differences in the actual quantity of the company s reserves and amount of estimated future net cash flows from the estimated oil and gas reserves 
the discounted after tax future net cash flows from the estimated reserve quantities impact the recorded value of the full cost pool as discussed below 
if the estimate of proved reserve volumes declines or the estimate of future development costs increases  the dd a expense the company records increases  reducing net income 
certain early stage exploratory costs are excluded from costs subject to the dd a calculation 
the company evaluates these excluded costs quarterly  and the costs are added to the dd a base if the company determines the costs will or will not result in commercially productive oil or gas production 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties the company accounts for its oil and gas properties using the full cost method 
under this method  the company is required to record a permanent impairment provision if the net book value of its oil and gas properties net of related deferred taxes exceeds a ceiling value equal to the sum of i the present value of the future cash inflows from proved reserves  tax effected and discounted at per annum  and ii the cost of unevaluated properties 
the ceiling test is computed by country and at the end of each quarter 
the oil and gas prices used in calculating future cash inflows in the united states are based upon the market price on the last day of the accounting period 
oil and gas prices are generally volatile  and if the market prices at a period end date have decreased  the company may have to record an impairment 
a loss may also be generated by the transfer of significant early stage exploratory costs to the oil and gas property cost pool that is subject to the ceiling test 
these losses typically occur when significant costs are transferred to the oil and gas property cost pool as a result of an unsuccessful project without commercially productive oil and gas production 
the cost of the company s australian properties are recorded in a separate full cost pool  as required under the full cost method 
the prices received for sales in australia  which are used to calculate future cash inflows are primarily based on long term contracts with fixed prices 
however  while there is no volatility with respect to the price received in australian dollars  any volatility in the exchange rate affects the us dollar equivalent price received and exposes the company to a potential recorded loss in value 
in the event the company records a reduction in its discounted after tax future net cash flow from lower estimated reserve quantities  the company could be required to record a non cash loss 
in addition the company could record a non cash loss if costs associated with its domestic exploration projects are added to depletable costs within the domestic full cost pool without sufficient associated oil and gas reserves 
while the company s oil and gas properties are subject to impairments based on product price declines  subsequent increases in value due to price increases will not be recorded 
the company would however record a lower dd a expense  since the prior impairment would have reduced the net book value of the full cost pool 
contingencies the company accounts for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that the company record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of its financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting contingencies require the company to use its judgment and while the company believes that its accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from the loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss  the results of operations of the company will be impacted in the period the contingency is resolved 
in the fiscal year ended september  and in  the company recorded charges to expense of  and  respectively  for prepaid drilling costs that the company had estimated would not be realized as either capital expenditures or cash refunds at that time 
these sums were paid to the former operator of the comet ridge project in australia  with whom the company has been in litigation during the last several years 
in the quarter ended september   several months after assuming operations on the comet ridge project  the company recovered  relating to the prepaid drilling costs previously written off 
prior to taking over operations  the company and other plaintiffs paid million in disputed joint interest billings to the registry of the court  for future payment to tri star for billings held to be proper or future repayment to plaintiffs for billings held to be improper 
in  tri star effectively collected the disputed billings by withholding million in unused drilling funds advanced by the plaintiffs to tri star 
in december  parties agreed that the registry monies should be released to the plaintiffs  although the validity of the disputed billings remains in dispute and a matter of the litigation 
in december the company received its million share of registry funds  including interest 
upon receipt of the funds  the company recorded recovery of prepaid drilling costs of  interest income of  court fees of  and a liability of  if the court agrees that the million in disputed billings were improper  then upon recovery from the defendants  the company would receive million and reduce its full cost pool for approximately million of recovered capital costs and will record a gain of approximately  for recovered operating costs 
the company may also record gains or losses upon resolution of the comet ridge litigation that are unrelated to these disputed billings

liquidity and capital resources the company has used equity and debt financings and sales of producing properties to fund most of its capital expenditures and operations during the last few years 
these capital expenditures included the acquisition of additional interests in the comet ridge project in queensland  australia 
during  the company used million of cash in operating activities and invested million in capital expenditures and million in the repurchase of a royalty interest in the comet ridge project 
the company received proceeds of million from the sale of oil and gas assets 
the company s operating activities and capital investments were funded with million in net proceeds from debt financing 
debt financing during consisted of approximately million received from slough trading estates limited stel 
this financing  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  was primarily used for continued development of the comet ridge project and exploration of acreage within atp in addition  the borrowing from stel allowed the company to retire tcw asset management company tcw debt of approximately million  purchase the million royalty interest held by tcw and repay million in short term loans from slough estates usa inc slough 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  the company repaid the million debt associated with a drilling rig currently being used in australia with funds borrowed from stel 
at december   the company owed slough estates usa slough million 
the loan which is due in april bears an interest rate of libor as of december  plus 
the company has various commitments in addition to its long term debt 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  in thousands contractual obligation total thereafter long term debt    operating leases for office space  operating leases for equipment standby drilling fees petroleum lease expenditures  asset retirement obligation   the table below provides an analysis of the company s capital expenditures of million during the year ended december  capital expenditures activity in thousands australia comet ridge royalty interest acquisition  comet ridge drilling and completion  comet ridge facilities and equipment  other  domestic leasehold acquisitions  nine mile drilling and completion  lay creek drilling and completion other total  included within capital spending was  of capitalized interest expense associated with the company s australian and domestic properties 
during the year ended december   the company received proceeds from asset sales of million associated with the sale of a interest in the company s stateline prospect located in western nebraska 
exploration and development drilling commitments the company s anticipated capital expenditures during total approximately million 
in australia  the company expects to incur capital costs of million 
fourteen million dollars would be for exploratory drilling and for gas gathering and water disposal facilities 
four million dollars would be for exploration activities on atp and atp capital spending in the united states  primarily on the company s lay creek  frenchman and republican prospects  is expected to be approximately million 
of the million described above  the company plans to fund the million estimated for the australian capital expenditures under the australian bank facility described below 
of the remaining million in planned expenditures  the company has determined approximately million is discretionary and will be expended only if the company obtains additional capital as described below 
the company anticipates funding operations and capital expenditures in australia and the united states for using a cash on hand at december   b net gas revenues  c expected proceeds of approximately million million australian in long term borrowings under an million aud approximately million usd australian bank credit facility the company expects to sign in the near term and d a commitment from slough to provide funds for working capital  board approved capital expenditures and operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to fund discretionary domestic capital expenditures in in excess of these cash resources  the company contemplates that it will require alternative sources of capital 
additional sources of funding may include additional debt financings and asset sales 
with the sale of interests in its prospective acreage  the company expects to generate cash to reduce its investment in individual projects 
however  in the event that sufficient funding cannot be obtained  the company will be required to curtail planned expenditures and may have to sell additional acreage and or relinquish acreage 
year ended december  during  the company used million of cash in operating activities and invested cash of million in capital expenditures 
the company received proceeds of million from the sale of oil and gas assets 
the company s operating activities and capital investments were funded with cash on hand at the beginning of the year of million and net proceeds of million of debt financing 
debt financings during included million received from tcw asset management company tcw and million received from slough estates usa slough  the company s largest shareholder 
the tcw borrowing was used for continued development of the comet ridge project 
the million received from slough was used to fund domestic projects and for general corporate purposes 
in  the company made principal payments to slough of  on the note payable associated with the drilling rig being used in australia 
through august   the company was a party to an amended and restated credit agreement with tcw with a principal balance of million  which was used for development of the comet ridge project 
as set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has repaid this loan 
the table below provides a detailed analysis of capital expenditures of million during the year ended december  capital expenditures activity in thousands australia comet ridge acquisitions  comet ridge drilling and completion  comet ridge facilities and equipment  other domestic leasehold acquisitions  nine mile drilling and completion  lay creek drilling and completion  other total  included within capital spending was  of capitalized interest expense associated with the company s australian and domestic properties 
proceeds from asset sales of million during included million from the sale of interests in the frenchman and republican prospects in colorado  million from the sale of the west buna properties in texas   received from the sale of a interest in the nine mile prospect in colorado and million in reimbursed lay creek drilling costs under the terms of a purchase and sale agreement 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  the company incurred a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in the increase in the loss is principally attributable to the write off of deferred loan costs  higher debt service costs  an impairment of the carrying value of the company s us oil and gas properties and higher operating costs 
the increase in the higher operating costs was partially offset by a favorable currency exchange gain 
the table below provides a comparison of operations 
the table is intended to provide a comparative review of significant operational items and  accordingly  nominal differences may exist from the amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
certain prior period amounts may have been reclassified to ensure comparability

revenues and volumes the increase in the company s operating revenues was due principally to increased gas production and higher gas prices received from the company s australian comet ridge project 
australian revenues increased due to a increase in gas volumes sold and a increase in average gas prices 
favorable foreign currency exchange rates were the principal factors contributing to the average gas price increase 
the company s current australian gas sales contracts are long term fixed contracts with yearly adjustments for inflation 
in natural gas production operations  joint owners sometimes sell more or less than the production volumes to which they are entitled based on their revenue ownership interest 
the joint operating agreement relating to the comet ridge project includes gas balancing provisions to govern production allocations in this situation 
the company records a natural gas imbalance in other liabilities if any excess takes of natural gas exceed its remaining proved reserves for the property 
as of december   the company had taken and sold more than its share of natural gas volumes produced from the comet ridge project  and was overproduced by approximately  mmcf net of royalties 
based on the december  average sales price of per mcf  this overproduction represents million in gas revenues 
no liability has been recorded for the excess volumes taken as they do not exceed the company s share of remaining proved reserves 
under the terms of the gas balancing agreement  the company may be required to reduce the monthly volumes it sells by up to of its entitled share of sales  to enable underproduced parties to sell more than their entitled share of the gas sales and cure the imbalance 
gas sales in the us decreased significantly due to the sale of substantially all of the company s us producing properties in may expenses and foreign exchange gains losses australia operating expenses increased by in due to an increase in the number of wells drilled and producing  an increase in the company s ownership in the comet ridge project in mid  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the average operating costs per mcf sold in australia increased from per mcf to per mcf  an increase of 
the rise in operating costs  principally in the comet ridge fairview field  was due to higher field costs caused by the increase in the number of wells to be serviced and higher compressor costs 
approximately of the per unit operating costs were associated with compressor costs and costs incurred on wells that are dewatering and not selling gas 
depletion expense for the australian project increased in due to higher sales volumes and an increase in the average depletion rate per unit produced and sold 
higher finding costs for reserves added was the principal factor increasing the depletion rate 
the impairment expense of approximately million was attributed largely to unsuccessful exploration on the nine mile prospect 
domestic operating costs were largely attributable to the lay creek coalseam methane project where the initial ten wells are in the dewatering phase 
operating costs in the powder river basin  the company s sole domestic producing property  averaged approximately per mcf 
general and administrative expenses increased in due principally to higher personnel costs associated with increased activity in australia resulting from growth of the comet ridge project 
interest expense increased by million in due to increased borrowings and higher loan balances 
in the third quarter of  the company wrote off approximately million in deferred loan costs related to the tcw loan retired on august  the company recovered  of prepaid drilling costs previously written off in and both the recovery and write offs are associated with the litigation involving the company s australian properties 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange gain  recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation sfas  approximated million in this gain was principally attributable to intercompany debt toga owed the company prior to august  the non permanent portion of this intercompany debt was substantially reduced on august   and such reduction is expected to reduce future foreign currency gains and losses 
comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  the company incurred a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in the reduced loss in compared to resulted primarily from million in gains on the sale of two us properties recorded during the table below is intended to provide a comparative review of significant operational items 
accordingly  nominal differences may exist from the amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
certain prior period amounts may have been reclassified to ensure comparability 
year ended december december increase decrease increase decrease in thousands  except average per mcf prices and costs worldwide operations gas and oil revenue    other revenue gas volumes mmcf    oil volumes mbbls average gas price per mcf average oil price per bbl operating expense   average operating cost per mcf equivalent mcfe sold general and administrative   depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a   interest expense   australia operations gas revenue    gas volumes mmcf    average gas price per mcf operating expense    average operating cost per mcf sold oil and gas property dd a  other dd a oil and gas property dd a rate per mcfe sold domestic operations gas and oil revenue gas volumes mmcf oil volumes mbbls average gas price per mcf average oil price per bbl operating expense average operating cost per mcfe sold oil and gas property dd a other dd a oil and gas property dd a rate per mcfe sold revenues and volumes while revenues  gas and oil volumes in the us decreased due to the sale of substantially all us producing properties in may  gas volumes sold in australia increased due to increased gas sales from existing wells and also from new wells drilled and connected to the gathering system during gas revenues in australia increased as a result of the sales volume increase  favorable exchange rate changes and sales price increases during expenses and foreign exchange gains losses operating expenses in australia increased along with increased sales volumes 
the increase in australian operating costs per mcf related to activity at the comet ridge fairview field 
the increase consisted of a decrease for field wide cost efficiencies and a increase related to the company s acquisition of additional interests in the fairview field 
cost efficiencies occurred when total field costs increased proportionately less than field sales volumes increased in over the acquisitions increased the company s share of field wide costs and entitled share of gas sales  but reduced for the company s actual gas sales volumes in excess of entitled volumes because of underproduction of the acquired interests 
as a result  the company s share of operating costs increased in greater than the company s share of gas sales volumes did 
domestic operating expenses decreased significantly due to the us property sales 
general and administrative expenses for increased when compared to  primarily due to costs associated with assuming operations of the comet ridge project 
in australia  oil and gas property dd a expense increased due to increased sales volumes 
other dd a in australia increased  due to depreciation associated with a drilling rig the company acquired for use on the comet ridge project 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  the company recorded million in gains on domestic property sales 
the company also recovered  in prepaid drilling costs compared to  for impairment of prepaid drilling costs in the recovery of prepaid drilling costs was due to funds received from tri star in excess of recorded receivables for unused  prepaid drilling costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense increased to million from million or  primarily due to an increase in long term debt outstanding for most of foreign currency exchange losses in were  compared to a loss of  in because the equivalent us dollar value of the australian dollar remained relatively stable during and increased slightly during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates and commodity prices 
the company does not use financial instruments to any degree to manage foreign currency  interest rate and commodity risks and does not hold or issue financial instruments to any degree for trading purposes 
at december   the company was exposed to some market risk with respect to foreign currency  long term debt  and natural gas prices  however  management did not believe such risk to be material 
foreign currency risk the company s subsidiary  tipperary oil and gas australia pty ltd toga uses the australian dollar as its functional currency 
to the extent that business transactions in australia are not denominated in the australian dollar  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
during  the company benefited from the non permanent intercompany debt toga owed tipperary corporation that was denominated in us dollars 
the company recorded a foreign currency gain of million related to this intercompany debt 
as this non permanent intercompany debt is now retired  the company does not anticipate recording significant future foreign currency gains or losses due to changes in exchange rates 
toga does expect to participate in some us dollar transactions  but does not anticipate such transactions will result in a significant foreign currency risk 
during  the company has experienced significant growth in the accumulated translation adjustment  the oil and gas properties accounts  and the standardized measure of proved reserve value due to the strengthening of the australian dollar as compared to the us dollar 
the company may experience significant changes in these accounts and the standardized measure during and in future years if exchange rates are volatile  however  such volatility will not result in a loss or gain on the income statement 
the majority of the company s revenues  operating expenses and general and administrative expenses in australia are incurred in australian dollars 
during  the company s revenues and expenses increased as a result of the strength of the australian dollar 
the company expects its financial results will be impacted by exchange rate volatility  but does not expect a significant effect on future earnings as a result of this volatility 
interest rate risk the company currently has a significant amount of outstanding debt and is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
while the majority of the company s current debt has been under long term fixed interest rate agreements  the expected new australian debt facility will be at a floating rate 
the company is at risk that rates could increase and costs required to refinance the debt may be prohibitive 
at current debt levels  a change in interest rate change will result in a cost or benefit to the company of  per year 
commodity price risk virtually all of the company s current sales revenues consist of natural gas sold in eastern australia 
the eastern australian gas market is primarily composed of long term fixed price contracts with adjustments made for the rate of inflation which minimizes the company s commodity price risk 
although not anticipated  the company may be required to recognize a non cash ceiling test impairment  as described in critical accounting polices found in item of this form k  of the australian properties if more costs are added to the full cost pool than are supported by gas reserves or the australian dollar weakens significantly 
the company has in the past and plans in the future to sell significant quantities of gas or oil in the united states market 
if the company does sell significant quantities of gas or oil in the united states  it may be exposed to price volatility that could affect the carrying value of its us oil and gas properties
