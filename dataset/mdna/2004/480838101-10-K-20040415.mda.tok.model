overview net income in fiscal increased to approximately million compared with approximately million in fiscal the company achieved record net income and earnings per share in each of the four quarters in fiscal the increased earnings were primarily attributable to increase in net sales with increases in both the stores and direct marketing catalog and internet segments  basis point increase in gross profit margins  and the opening of new stores 
management believes that the chain can grow to approximately stores from the fiscal year end base of stores 
the company plans to open between to stores in fiscal and between to stores each year thereafter to grow the chain to the store level 
the store growth is part of a strategic plan the company initiated in fiscal in the past four years  the company has continued to increase the number of store openings as infrastructure and performance has improved 
as such  there were ten new stores opened in fiscal including two factory stores  new stores in fiscal  new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal fiscal store openings are currently scheduled as follows stores in the first quarter five of which were opened as of april   stores in the second quarter and the rest thereafter

the company also expects inventories to increase in to support new store openings  sales growth in existing segments and other initiatives 
the company amended its credit agreement with its bank in january  extending the term to april  and increasing its available borrowings up to million  if needed and if supported by its borrowing base formula under the credit agreement 
the amended agreement increased the borrowing capacity from million 
the company s availability in excess of outstanding borrowings  as supported by the existing borrowing base under its credit agreement  was million at january  compared with million at the same time in fiscal total bank debt outstanding under the credit agreement  excluding mortgages and long term notes  was million at january  compared with million at february  the increased debt compared with last year is primarily a result of the funding of inventories to support new store growth and to build the basic inventory levels as part of an always in stock program 
common stock dividend 
on january   the company s board of directors declared a common stock dividend payable on february  to stockholders of record as of january  all historical weighted average share and per share amounts and all references to the number of common shares elsewhere in the consolidated financial statements  and notes thereto have been restated to reflect the stock dividend 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements  a number of assumptions and estimates are made that  in the judgment of management  are proper in light of existing general economic and company specific circumstances 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require management s most significant judgments and estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the consolidated financial statements 
inventory 
the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing 
the company reduces the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value where cost exceeds estimated selling price less costs of disposal 
management s sales assumptions are based on the company s experience that historically most of the company s inventory is sold through the company s primary sales channels and the company has not been required to sell significant amounts of inventory to third party liquidators 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  reductions in the value of inventory may be required 
asset valuation 
long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  subject to depreciation and amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the valuation of these assets is dependent on the company s ability to continue to generate profits at both the company and store levels 
while the company has taken reasonable care in preparing these estimates and making these judgments  actual results could and probably will differ from the estimates 
management believes that any difference in the actual results from the estimates will not have a material effect upon the company s financial position or results of operations

certain additional business risk factors the company s statements concerning future operations contained herein are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those forecast due to a variety of factors outside of the company s control that can affect the company s operating results  liquidity and financial condition such as risks associated with economic  weather  public health and other factors affecting consumer spending  the ability of the company to finance its expansion plans  the mix and pricing of goods sold  the market price of key raw materials such as wool and cotton  availability of lease sites for new stores  the ability to source product from its global supplier base and other competitive factors 
these cautionary statements qualify all of the forward looking statements the company makes herein 
the company cannot assure you that the results or developments anticipated by the company will be realized or  even if substantially realized  that those results or developments will result in the expected consequences for the company or affect the company  its business or its operations in the way the company expects 
the company cautions you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of their respective dates  and assumes no obligation to update any of the forward looking statements 
these risks should be carefully reviewed before making any investment decision 
growth risks 
a significant portion of the company s growth has resulted and is expected to continue to result from the opening of new stores 
while the company believes that it will continue to be able to obtain suitable locations for new stores  negotiate acceptable lease terms  hire qualified personnel and open and operate new stores on a timely and profitable basis  no such assurances can be made 
as the company continues its expansion program  the opening of stores may adversely affect catalog and internet sales in such markets  and the opening of additional stores in existing markets may adversely affect sales and profits of established stores 
competition 
the retail apparel business is highly competitive and is expected to remain so 
the company competes primarily with other specialty and discount store chains  independent retailers  national and local department stores  internet retail stores and other catalogers engaged in the retail sale of apparel  and to a lesser degree with other apparel retailers 
many of these competitors are much larger than the company and have significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
the company believes that its emphasis on classic styles makes it less vulnerable to changes in fashion trends than many apparel retailers  however  the company s sales and profitability depend upon the continued demand for its classic styles 
the company faces a variety of competitive challenges including anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands  maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing its products to consumers in several diverse market segments  developing innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes  competitively pricing its products and achieving customer perception of value  and providing strong and effective marketing support 
consumer spending 
the company s business is sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending  including political and economic conditions such as the levels of disposable consumer income  consumer debt  interest rates and consumer confidence 
declines in consumer spending on apparel and accessories could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
reliance on key suppliers 
historically  the company has bought a substantial portion of its products from a limited number of suppliers throughout the world 
the loss of any one of these suppliers could cause a delay in the company s sales process 
any significant interruption in the company s product supply could have an adverse effect on its business due to delays in finding alternative sources and could result in increased costs to the company 
market price of raw materials 
the company s products are manufactured using several key raw materials  including wool and cotton  which are subject to fluctuations in price and availability 
historically  the company has not experienced significant fluctuations in price or availability 
however  any significant increase in the price or decrease in the availability of certain raw materials could have an adverse impact on the company s business 
disaster causing disruption of normal operations 
factors such as an interruption of key business systems  any disaster or casualty resulting in the interruption of service from our distribution center  changes in weather patterns  world health concerns such as the sars virus  and international and domestic acts of terror could negatively affect the company s financial performance 
fashion trends and changing consumer preferences 
the company must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed 
the company s success is dependent upon its ability to gauge the fashion tastes of its customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner 
the retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences dictated  in part  by fashion and season 
to the extent the company misjudges the market for its merchandise  its sales will be adversely affected and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect its operating results 
while the company believes its current strategies and initiatives appropriately address these issues  merchandise misjudgments could have a material adverse effect on its image with its customers and on its operating results 
the company s ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing fashion trends depends in part on its ability to attract and retain key personnel in its design  merchandising  marketing and other staff 
competition for these personnel is intense  and the company cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods 
fluctuations in the demand for tailored and casual clothing and accessories affect the inventory levels  since merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before fashion trends are evidenced by customer purchases 
in addition  as the company s business is becoming more cyclical in nature  the company must carry a significant amount of inventory  especially prior to peak selling seasons when the company builds up its inventory levels 
the company issues purchase orders for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season 
as a result  the company is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases 
in addition  lead times for many of the company s purchases are long  which may make it more difficult for the company to respond rapidly to new or changing fashion trends or consumer acceptance for the company s products 
growth by acquisition  etc 
the company may from time to time hold discussions and negotiations with i potential investors who express an interest in making an investment in or acquiring the company  ii potential joint venture partners looking toward the formation of strategic alliances and iii companies that represent potential acquisition or investment opportunities for the company 
there can be no assurance any definitive agreement will be reached regarding the foregoing  nor does the company believe that at this time any such agreement is necessary to implement successfully its strategic plans 
seasonality although variations in sales volumes do exist between quarters  the company believes the nature of its merchandise helps to stabilize demand between the different periods of the year 
however  as the company s merchandise continues to include more corporate casual and sportswear and as more new stores are opened in the second half of the year  profits generated during the fourth quarter have become a larger portion of annual profits 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at january   there were no derivative financial instruments 
in addition  the company does not believe it is materially at risk for changes in market interest rates or foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s interest on borrowings under its credit agreement is at a variable rate based on the prime rate or a spread over the libor 
a basis point change in interest rate would have changed interest expense  net by approximately million in fiscal
