item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations basis of presentation in the combination completed on january  and accounted for as a purchase  dorchester hugoton was designated as the accounting acquirer 
prior to january   our partnership had no combined operations 
in these circumstances  we are required to present  discuss and analyze the financial condition and results of operations of dorchester hugoton  the accounting acquiror  for the two years ended december  and the financial condition and results of operations of our partnership for the year ended december   which includes the results of operations for dorchester hugoton for the one month period ended january  and the financial condition and results of operations for our partnership for the eleven month period ended december  for the purposes of this presentation  the term combination means the transactions consummated in connection with the combination of the business and properties of dorchester hugoton  republic and spinnaker 
normally  our period to period changes in net earnings and cash flows from operating activities are principally determined by changes in oil and natural gas sales volumes and prices  and to a lesser extent  by capital expenditures deducted under the net profits interests calculation

our net operating revenues increased from  during to  primarily as a result of increased natural gas prices combined with the effects of the combination 
management cautions the reader in the comparison of results for these periods because revenues attributable to properties formerly owned by republic and spinnaker are not included in the periods prior to february see basis of presentation and note of the notes to financial statements 
during  several categories of costs were higher than in as a result of non recurring expenses associated with the liquidation of dorchester hugoton 
such comparisons include combination and related expenses which increased from  to  primarily as a result of approximately  in severance payments and related costs 
similarly  management fees in include a one time  charge 
also  general and administrative costs including tax and regulatory expenses increased from  to  primarily as a result of  in insurance premiums for dorchester hugoton officers and directors continuation coverage and the costs of office facilities and personnel resulting from the combination with republic and spinnaker 
see basis of presentation and note of the notes to financial statements 
depletion  depreciation and amortization increased from  in to  in primarily as a result of the effects of a higher depreciable base due to effects of purchase accounting rules required for the combination 
cash flow from operations and cash distributions to unitholders are not affected by depletion  depreciation and amortization 
management cautions the reader in the comparison of results for these periods because operations of the properties formerly owned by republic and spinnaker are not included in the periods prior to february see basis of presentation  and note of the notes to financial statements 
during  our partnership recorded non cash charges against earnings totaling  the write down represents an impairment of oil and gas properties that resulted primarily from the difference  after accumulated depletion and prior write downs  between the discounted present value of our partnership s proved natural gas and oil reserves using the quarter ending gas and oil prices as compared to the initial book value assigned to former republic and spinnaker assets in accordance with purchase accounting rules  which value significantly exceeded historic book value 
the write down is a function of such increased initial book value  accumulated depletion and prior write downs  and changes in prevailing oil and gas prices since the combination transaction 
cash flow from operations and cash distributions to unitholders are not affected by the write down 
see notes and of the notes to financial statements and liquidity and capital resources critical accounting policies 
considering the impairment asset write down representing the non cash charge to earnings  net earnings decreased from  during to a loss of  earnings excluding the asset write down  a financial measure not defined by generally accepted accounting principles increased from  during to  during due primarily to increased oil and natural gas prices and the effects of the combination 
earnings excluding the asset write down are computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with the exception of the exclusion of the asset write down 
management believes the presentation of earnings excluding the asset write down is useful to unitholders

as shown in the table on page  dorchester hugoton s gas sales volumes during were lower than in dorchester hugoton s oklahoma volumes were influenced by reduced gas pipeline receipts in because of an explosion unrelated to dorchester hugoton and natural reservoir decline 
dorchester hugoton s kansas gas sales volumes during were lower than in as a result of state well testing and natural reservoir decline 
dorchester hugoton s natural gas weighted average sales prices in declined from the significantly lower gas prices and lower gas volumes caused net operating revenues to decrease in compared to dorchester hugoton s operating costs during were lower than in primarily as a result of lower production taxes associated with reduced gas revenues and lower operating expenses as a result of the completion in of scheduled oklahoma engine maintenance repairs of approximately  dorchester hugoton recognized a gain in other income of  on the sale of exxonmobil stock during december  which was sold in anticipation of the combination 
in summary  net income declined in as compared to primarily as a result of the significant decline in natural gas prices in as compared to liquidity and capital resources capital resources our primary sources of capital are our cash flow from the net profits interests and the royalty properties 
our only cash requirements are the distributions to our unitholders  the payment of oil and gas production and property taxes not otherwise deducted from gross production revenues and general and administrative expenses incurred on our behalf and allocated in accordance with our partnership agreement 
since the distributions to our unitholders are  by definition  determined after the payment of all expenses actually paid by us  the only cash requirements that may create liquidity concerns for us are the payments of expenses 
since most of these expenses vary directly with oil and natural gas prices and sales volumes  we anticipate that sufficient funds will be available at all times for payment of these expenses 
see distributions for the amounts and dates of cash distributions to our unitholders 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we are not directly liable for the payment of any exploration  development or production costs 
we do not have any transactions  arrangements or other relationships that could materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party  nor do we have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities that could potentially result in unconsolidated debt 
pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement  we cannot incur indebtedness  other than trade payables  i in excess of  in the aggregate at any given time or ii which would constitute acquisition indebtedness as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
expenses and capital expenditures the operating partnership does not currently anticipate drilling additional wells as a working interest owner in the fort riley zone or the council grove formations or elsewhere in the oklahoma properties previously owned by dorchester hugoton 
successful activities by others in these formations could prompt a reevaluation of this position 
any such drilling is estimated to cost  to  per well 
the operating partnership anticipates continuing additional fracture treating in the oklahoma properties previously owned by dorchester hugoton but is unable to predict the cost until additional engineering studies are performed 
previous fracture treatments in those properties have cost between  and  per well  excluding any needed casing repairs 
such activities by the operating partnership could influence the amount we receive from the net profits interests 
the operating partnership owns and operates the wells  pipelines and gas compression and dehydration facilities located in kansas and oklahoma previously owned by dorchester hugoton 
the operating partnership anticipates gradual increases in expenses as repairs to these facilities become more frequent  and anticipates gradual increases in field operating expenses as reservoir pressure declines 
the operating partnership does not anticipate incurring significant expense to replace these facilities at this time 
the operating partnership incurred approximately  of capital costs in connection with the installation of field compression facilities on portions of its oklahoma properties during the second and third quarters of incremental operating costs primarily compressor rentals attributable to these facilities are estimated to be approximately  per year 
these capital and operating costs are reflected in the net profit interests payments we receive from the operating partnership 
gas sales from the operating partnership s oklahoma properties previously owned by dorchester hugoton during the second half of were approximately greater than during the first half of reserves assigned to these properties at december  were approximately greater than at december  management believes the increased gas sales and reserves are largely due to the installation of additional field compression capacity 
the operating partnership does not currently plan to install additional field compression capacity 
in  oklahoma regulations removed production quantity restrictions in the guymon hugoton field  and did not address efforts by third parties to persuade oklahoma to permit infill drilling in the guymon hugoton field 
both infill drilling and removal of production limits could require considerable capital expenditures 
the outcome and the cost of such activities are unpredictable 
such activities by the operating partnership could influence the amount we receive from the net profits interests 
no additional compression affecting the wells formerly owned by dorchester hugoton has been installed since by operators on adjoining acreage 
the operating partnership believes it now has sufficient field compression to remain competitive with adjoining operators for the foreseeable future

net profits interests we receive monthly payments from the operating partnership equal to of the net proceeds actually realized by the operating partnership from the properties underlying the net profits interests 
the operating partnership retains the balance of these net proceeds 
net proceeds generally reflect gross proceeds attributable to oil and natural gas production actually received during the month less production costs actually paid during the same month 
production costs generally reflect drilling  completion  operating and general and administrative costs and exclude depletion  amortization and other non cash costs 
the operating partnership made net profits interests payments to us totaling  during march through september  which payments reflected of total net proceeds of  realized from february through august net proceeds realized by the operating partnership during september through november were reflected in net profits interests payments made during october through december these payments were included in the fourth quarter distribution paid in early and are excluded from this analysis 
royalty properties revenues from the royalty properties are typically paid to us with proportionate severance production taxes deducted and remitted by others 
additionally  we generally only pay ad valorem taxes  general and administrative costs  and marketing and associated costs since royalties and lease bonuses generally do not otherwise bear operating or similar costs 
after deduction of the above described costs  our net cash receipts from the royalty properties during the period february through september were   of which was distributed to the limited partners and  of which was distributed to the general partner 
proceeds received by us from the royalty properties during the period october through december became part of the distribution paid in such distribution is excluded from this analysis

due to these fixed percentages  our general partner does not have any incentive distribution rights or other right or arrangement which will increase its percentage share of net cash generated by our activities or those of the operating partnership 
during the period february through september  our partnership s quarterly distribution payments to limited partners were based on all of its available cash 
our partnership s only significant cash reserves that influenced quarterly payments were for ad valorem taxes 
additionally  certain production costs under the net profits interests calculation and a small portion of management expense reimbursements include amounts for which funds were set aside monthly to enable payment when due 
examples are pension contributions and insurance premiums 
these amounts generally are not held for periods over one year 
general and administrative costs in accordance with our partnership agreement  we bear all general and administrative and other overhead expenses subject to certain limitations 
we reimburse our general partner for certain allocable costs  including rent  wages  salaries and employee benefit plans 
this reimbursement is limited to an amount equal to the sum of of our distributions plus certain costs previously paid 
through december   the limitation was substantially in excess of the reimbursement amounts actually paid or accrued

index to financial statements unaudited pro forma data the following table sets forth summary unaudited pro forma financial data for our partnership for the years ended december  and as though the combination occurred as of january  the pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be reported in the future 
pro forma adjustments have been made to depletion  depreciation  and amortization to reflect the new basis of accounting for the assets of spinnaker and republic as of january   and to revenues to reflect the revenues of dorchester hugoton as net profits interests 
year ended december  in thousands except per unit data statement of operations data total operating revenues operating expenses  excluding depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization impairment total operating expenses other income net earnings loss net earnings loss per unit critical accounting policies we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and gas properties 
under this method  all such costs productive and nonproductive are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test  however  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and gas reserves discounted at plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
in accordance with applicable accounting rules  dorchester hugoton was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of the republic and spinnaker assets 
our partnership s acquisition of these assets was recorded at a value based on the closing price of dorchester hugoton s common units immediately prior to consummation of the combination transaction  subject to certain adjustments 
consequently  the acquisition of these assets was recorded at values that exceed the historical book value of these assets prior to consummation of the combination transaction 
our partnership did not assign any book or market value to unproved properties  including nonproducing royalty  mineral and leasehold interests 
the full cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter 
for  our unamortized costs of oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling test 
as a result  in  our partnership recorded full cost write downs of  the discounted present value of our proved oil and gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and requires many subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering and geological analyses 
different reserve engineers may reach different conclusions as to estimated quantities of natural gas reserves based on the same information 
our reserve estimates are prepared by independent consultants 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding reserve estimates  and revisions are made to prior estimates based on updated information 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
significant downward revisions could result in an impairment representing a non cash charge to earnings 
in addition to the impact on calculation of the ceiling test  estimates of proved reserves are also a major component of the calculation of depletion 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil and gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of our reserves are objectively determined 
the ceiling 
table of contents 
index to financial statements test calculation requires use of prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the accounting period  which are generally held constant for the life of the properties 
as a result  the present value is not necessarily an indication of the fair value of the reserves 
oil and gas prices have historically been volatile and the prevailing prices at any given time may not reflect our partnership s or the industry s forecast of future prices 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
for example  estimates of uncollected revenues and unpaid expenses from royalties and net profits interests in properties operated by non affiliated entities are particularly subjective due to inability to gain accurate and timely information 
therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  dorchester minerals adopted sfas no 
on january  which did not have a material effect on its financial statements 
we have been made aware that an issue has arisen within the industry regarding the application of provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
the issue is whether sfas no 
requires companies to reclassify costs associated with mineral rights  including both proved and unproved leasehold acquisition costs  as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs 
historically  we and other oil and gas companies have included the cost of these oil and gas leasehold interests as part of oil and gas properties 
also under consideration is whether sfas no 
requires companies to provide the additional disclosures prescribed by sfas no 
for intangible assets for costs associated with mineral rights 
a majority of the partnership s oil and gas properties are perpetual in nature  so the applicability of sfas to these type of assets is not known at this time 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas no 
requires us to reclassify costs associated with mineral rights from property and equipment to intangible assets  the amounts that would be reclassified would be immaterial to our financial position 
the reclassification of these amounts would not affect the method in which such costs are amortized or the manner in which we assess impairment of capitalized costs 
as a result  our cash flows and results of operations would not be affected by this reclassification 
risks related to our business our cash distributions are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices  which have historically been very volatile 
our quarterly cash distributions depend in significant part on the prices realized from the sale of oil and  in particular  natural gas 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
various factors that are beyond our control will affect prices of oil and natural gas  such as the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil prices and production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions

index to financial statements the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the availability of pipeline capacity  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  and the overall economic environment 
lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economic to produce and may reduce our revenues and operating income 
the volatility of oil and natural gas prices reduces the accuracy of estimates of future cash distributions to unitholders 
terrorist attacks on oil and natural gas production facilities  transportation systems and storage facilities could have a material adverse impact on our business 
oil and natural gas production facilities  transportation systems and storage facilities could be targets of terrorist attacks 
these attacks could have a material adverse impact if certain oil and natural gas infrastructure integral to our operations were interrupted  damaged or destroyed  thus preventing the sale of oil and gas 
we do not control operations and development of the royalty properties or the properties underlying the net profits interests that the operating partnership does not operate  which could impact the amount of our cash distributions 
essentially all of the producing properties we acquired from republic and spinnaker are royalty interests 
as a royalty owner  we do not control the development of these properties or the volumes of oil and natural gas produced from them 
the decision to develop these properties  including infill drilling  exploration of horizons deeper or shallower than the currently producing intervals  and application of enhanced recovery techniques will be made by the operator and other working interest owners of each property including our lessees and may be influenced by factors beyond our control  including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices  interest rates  budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions 
as the owner of a fractional undivided mineral or royalty interest  our ability to influence development of these nonproducing properties is severely limited 
also  since one of our stated business objectives is to avoid the generation of unrelated business taxable income  we will generally avoid participation in the development of our properties as a working interest or other expense bearing owner 
the decision to explore for oil and natural gas on these properties will be made by the operator and other working interest owners of each property including our lessees and may be influenced by factors beyond our control  including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices  interest rates  budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions 
our unitholders are not able to influence or control the operation or future development of the properties underlying the net profits interests 
the operating partnership is unable to influence significantly the operations or future development of properties that it does not operate 
the operating partnership and the other current operators of the properties underlying the net profits interests are under no obligation to continue operating the underlying properties 
the operating partnership can sell any of the properties underlying the net profits interests that it operates and relinquish the ability to control or influence operations 
any such sale or transfer must also simultaneously include the net profits interests at a corresponding price 
our unitholders do not have the right to replace an operator 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our lease bonus revenue depends in significant part on the actions of third parties which are outside of our control 
a significant portion of the nonproducing properties acquired from republic and spinnaker are mineral interests 
with limited exceptions  we have the right to grant leases of these interests to third parties 
we anticipate receiving cash payments as bonus consideration for granting these leases in most instances 
our ability to influence third parties decisions to become our lessees with respect to these nonproducing properties is severely limited  and those decisions may be influenced by factors beyond our control  including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices  interest rates  budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions 
the operating partnership may transfer or abandon properties that are subject to the net profits interests 
our general partner  through the operating partnership  may at any time transfer all or part of the properties underlying the net profits interests 
our unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer  however  any such transfer must also simultaneously include the net profits interests at a corresponding price 
the operating partnership or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities 
this could result in termination of the net profits interests relating to the abandoned well 
cash distributions are affected by production and other costs  some of which are outside of our control 
the cash available for distribution that comes from our royalty and mineral interests  including the net profits interests  is directly affected by increases in production costs and other costs 
some of these costs are outside our control  including costs of regulatory compliance and severance and other similar taxes 
other expenditures are dictated by business necessity  such as drilling additional wells in response to the drilling activity of others 
our oil and natural gas reserves and the underlying properties are depleting assets  and there are limitations on our ability to replace them 
our revenues and distributions depend in large part on the quantity of oil and natural gas produced from properties in which we hold an interest 
our producing oil and natural gas properties over time will all experience declines in production due to depletion of their oil and natural gas reservoirs  with the rates of decline varying by property 
replacement of reserves to maintain production levels requires maintenance  development or exploration projects on existing properties  or the acquisition of additional properties 
the timing and size of any maintenance  development or exploration projects depends on the market prices of oil and natural gas and on other factors beyond our control 
many of the decisions regarding implementation of such projects  including drilling or exploration on any unleased and undeveloped acreage  will be made by third parties 
in addition  development possibilities in the hugoton field are limited by the developed nature of that field and by regulatory restrictions 
our ability to increase reserves through future acquisitions is limited by restrictions on our use of cash and limited partnership interests for acquisitions and by our general partner s obligation to use all reasonable efforts to avoid unrelated business taxable income 
in addition  the ability of affiliates of our general partner to pursue business opportunities for their own accounts without tendering them to us in certain circumstances may reduce the acquisitions presented to our partnership for consideration 

table of contents 
index to financial statements drilling activities on our properties may not be productive  which could have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition 
the operating partnership may undertake drilling activities in limited circumstances on the properties underlying the net profits interests  and third parties may undertake drilling activities on our other properties 
any increases in our reserves will come from such drilling activities or from acquisitions 
drilling involves a wide variety of risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain and drilling operations may be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  disputes with drill site landowners  unexpected drilling conditions  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment  adverse weather conditions  and disputes with drill site owners 
future drilling activities on our properties may not be successful 
if these activities are unsuccessful  this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  under the terms of the net profits interests  the costs of unsuccessful future drilling on the working interest properties that are subject to the net profits interests will reduce amounts payable to us under the net profits interests by of these costs 
our ability to identify and capitalize on acquisitions is limited by contractual provisions and substantial competition 
our partnership agreement limits our ability to acquire oil and natural gas properties in the future  especially for consideration other than our limited partnership interests 
because of the limitations on our use of cash for acquisitions and on our ability to accumulate cash for acquisition purposes  we may be required to attempt to effect acquisitions with our limited partnership interests 
however  sellers of properties we would like to acquire may be unwilling to take our limited partnership interests in exchange for properties 
our partnership agreement obligates our general partner to use all reasonable efforts to avoid generating unrelated business taxable income 
accordingly  to acquire working interests we would have to arrange for them to be converted into overriding royalty interests or another type of interest that did not generate unrelated business taxable income in a manner similar to the treatment of dorchester hugoton s properties in the combination 
third parties may be less likely to deal with us than with a purchaser to which such a condition would not apply 
these restrictions could prevent us from pursuing or completing business opportunities that might benefit us and our unitholders  particularly unitholders who are not tax exempt investors 
the duty of affiliates of our general partner to present acquisition opportunities to our partnership is limited  including pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated business opportunities agreement 
accordingly  business opportunities that could potentially be pursued by us might not necessarily come to our attention  which could limit our ability to pursue a business strategy of acquiring oil and natural gas properties 
we compete with other companies and producers for acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 

table of contents 
index to financial statements any future acquisitions will involve risks that could adversely affect our business  which our unitholders generally will not have the opportunity to evaluate 
our current strategy contemplates that we may grow through acquisitions 
we expect to participate in discussions relating to potential acquisition and investment opportunities 
if we consummate any future acquisitions  our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic  financial and other relevant information that we will consider in connection with the acquisition  unless the terms of the acquisition require approval of our unitholders 
additionally  our unitholders will bear of the dilution from issuing new common units while receiving essentially of the benefit as of the benefit goes to our general partner 
acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks  including assimilation difficulties  unfamiliarity with new assets or new geographic areas and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
in addition  the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors  including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves  rates of future production and future net revenues attributable to reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities 
our review and analysis of properties prior to any acquisition will be subject to uncertainties and  consistent with industry practice  may be limited in scope 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any oil and natural gas properties that we acquire into our operations or we may not achieve desired profitability objectives 
a natural disaster or catastrophe could damage pipelines  gathering systems and other facilities that service our properties  which could substantially limit our operations and adversely affect our cash flow 
if gathering systems  pipelines or other facilities that serve our properties are damaged by any natural disaster  accident  catastrophe or other event  our income could be significantly interrupted 
any event that interrupts the production  gathering or transportation of our oil and natural gas  or which causes us to share in significant expenditures not covered by insurance  could adversely impact the market price of our limited partnership units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
we do not carry business interruption insurance 
the vast majority of the properties subject to the net profits interests are geographically concentrated  which could cause net proceeds payable under the net profits interests to be impacted by regional events 
the vast majority of the properties subject to the net profits interests are all natural gas properties that are located almost exclusively in the hugoton field in oklahoma and kansas 
because of this geographic concentration  any regional events  including natural disasters  that increase costs  reduce availability of equipment or supplies  reduce demand or limit production may impact the net proceeds payable under the net profits interests more than if the properties were more geographically diversified 
the number of prospective natural gas purchasers and methods of delivery are considerably less than would otherwise exist from a more geographically diverse group of properties 
as a result  natural gas sales after gathering and compression tend to be sold to one buyer in each state  thereby increasing credit risk 
under the terms of the net profits interests  much of the economic risk of the underlying properties is passed along to us 
under the terms of the net profits interests  virtually all costs that may be incurred in connection with the properties  including overhead costs that are not subject to an annual reimbursement limit  are deducted as production costs or excess production costs in determining amounts payable to us 
therefore  we bear of the costs of the working interest properties  and if costs exceed revenues  we do not receive any payments under the net profits interests 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  the terms of the net profits interests provide for excess costs that cannot be charged currently because they exceed current revenues to be accumulated and charged in future periods  which could result in our not receiving any payments under the net profits interests until all prior uncharged costs have been recovered by the operating partnership 
damage claims associated with the production and gathering of our oil and natural gas properties could affect our cash flow 
the operating partnership owns and operates the gathering system and compression facilities acquired from dorchester hugoton 
casualty losses or damage claims from these operations would be production costs under the terms of the net profits interests and could adversely affect our cash flow 
we may indirectly experience costs from repair or replacement of aging equipment 
some of the operating partnership s current working interest wells were drilled and have been producing since prior to the mile oklahoma gas pipeline gathering system acquired from dorchester hugoton was originally installed in or about  and because of its age is in need of periodic repairs and upgrades 
should major components of this system require significant repairs or replacement  the operating partnership may incur substantial capital expenditures in the operation of the oklahoma properties previously owned by dorchester hugoton prior to the consummation of the combination  which  as production costs  would reduce our cash flow from these properties 
our operations are subject to operating hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be fully insured 
neither we nor the operating partnership are fully insured against certain of these risks  either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs 
operations that affect the properties are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the oil and natural gas business  including blowouts  cratering  explosions and pollution and other environmental damage  any of which could result in substantial decreases in the cash flow from our overriding royalty interests and other interests due to injury or loss of life  damage to or destruction of wells  production facilities or other property  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations 
any uninsured costs relating to the properties underlying the net profits interests will be deducted as a production cost in calculating the net proceeds payable to us 
governmental policies  laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and cash distributions 
our business and the properties in which we hold interests are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry as well as regulations relating to safety matters 
these laws and regulations can have a significant impact on production and costs of production 
for example  both oklahoma and kansas  where properties that are subject to the net profits interests are located  have the ability  directly or indirectly  to limit production from those properties  and such limitations or changes in those limitations could negatively impact us in the future 
as another example  oklahoma regulations currently restrict the concentration of gas production wells to one well for each acres 
for some time  certain interested parties have sought regulatory changes in oklahoma which would permit infill  or increased density  drilling similar to that which is available in kansas  which allows one well for each acres 
should oklahoma change its existing regulations to permit infill drilling  it is possible that a number of producers will commence increased density drilling in areas adjacent to the properties in oklahoma that are subject to the net profits interests 
if the operating partnership  or other operators of our properties do not do the same  our production levels relating to these properties may decrease 
capital expenditures relating to increased density on the properties underlying the net profits interests would be deducted from amounts payable to us under the net profits interests

index to financial statements environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could affect our cash flow 
as with other companies engaged in the ownership and production of oil and natural gas  we always expect to have some risk of exposure to environmental costs and liabilities because the costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation could reduce the amount we would receive from our properties 
the properties in which we hold interests are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs  health and safety and waste management 
governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits  which could increase production costs on our properties and affect their cash flow 
third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance 
it is likely that expenditures in connection with environmental matters  as part of normal capital expenditure programs  will affect the net cash flow from our properties 
future environmental law developments  such as stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies  could significantly increase the costs of production from our properties and reduce our cash flow 
our oil and gas reserve data and future net revenue estimates are uncertain 
estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues are projections based on engineering data and reports of independent consulting petroleum engineers hired for that purpose 
the process of estimating reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data 
therefore  those estimates should not be construed as being accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves 
if these estimates prove to be inaccurate  our business may be adversely affected by lower revenues 
we are affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices 
oil prices and natural gas prices may not experience corresponding price changes 
risks inherent in an investment in our common units cost reimbursement due our general partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available to distribute to our unitholders 
prior to making any distribution on the common units  we reimburse the general partner and its affiliates for reasonable costs and expenses of management 
the reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders 
our general partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses  subject to the annual limit of of an amount primarily based on our distributions to partners for that fiscal year 
the annual limit includes carry forward and carry back features  which could allow costs in a year to exceed what would otherwise be the annual reimbursement limit 
in addition  our general partner and its affiliates may provide us with other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our general partner 
our net income as reported for tax and financial statement purposes may differ significantly from our cash flow that is used to determine cash available for distributions 
net income as reported for financial statement purposes is presented on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices 
unitholder k tax statements are calculated based on applicable tax conventions  and taxable income as calculated for each year will be allocated among unitholders who hold units on the last day of each month 
distributions  however  are calculated on the basis of actual cash receipts  changes in cash reserves  and disbursements during the relevant reporting period 
consequently  due to timing differences between the receipt of proceeds of production and the point in time at which the production giving rise to those proceeds actually occurs  net income reported on our financial statements and on unitholder k s will not reflect actual cash distributions during that reporting period

index to financial statements our unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our general partner  and their ability to remove our general partner is limited 
our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business 
the general partner of our general partner manages our activities 
beginning with the annual meeting of limited partners  our unitholders only have the right to annually elect the managers comprising the advisory committee of the board of managers of the general partner of our general partner 
our unitholders do not have the right to elect the other managers of the general partner of our general partner  on an annual or any other basis 
our general partner may not be removed as our general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units including common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
our general partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient common units to be able to prevent its removal as general partner  but they do own sufficient common units to make the removal of our general partner by other unitholders difficult 
these provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our general partner or acquire control of us without the consent of our general partner 
as a result of these provisions  the price at which our common units trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price 
the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent 
our general partner has agreed not to withdraw voluntarily as our general partner on or before december  with limited exceptions  unless the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units excluding common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates approve the withdrawal 
however  the general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders 
other than some transfer restrictions agreed to among the owners of our general partner relating to their interests in our general partner  there is no restriction in our partnership agreement or otherwise for the benefit of our limited partners on the ability of the owners of our general partner to transfer their ownership interests to a third party 
the new owner of the general partner would then be in a position to replace the management of our partnership with its own choices 
our general partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interests  which may permit our general partner and its affiliates to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders 
we and our general partner and its affiliates share  and therefore compete for  the time and effort of general partner personnel who provide services to us 
officers of our general partner and its affiliates do not  and are not be required to  spend any specified percentage or amount of time on our business 
in fact  our general partner has a duty to manage our partnership in the best interests of our unitholders  but it also has a duty to operate its business for the benefit of its partners 
some of our officers are also involved in management and ownership roles in other oil and natural gas enterprises and have similar duties to them and devote time to their businesses 
because these shared officers function as both our representatives and those of our general partner and its affiliates and of third parties  conflicts of interest could arise between our general partner and its affiliates  on the one hand  and us or our unitholders  on the other  or between us or our unitholders on the one hand and the third parties for which our officers also serve management functions 
as a result of these conflicts  our general partner and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of unitholders 
we may issue additional securities  diluting our unitholders interests 
we can and may issue additional common units and other capital securities representing limited partnership units  including options  warrants  rights  appreciation rights and securities with rights to distributions and allocations or in liquidation equal or superior to the securities described in this document  however  a majority of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the unitholders must approve such issuance if i the partnership securities to be issued will have greater rights or powers than our common units or ii if after giving effect to such issuance  such newly issued partnership securities represent over of the outstanding limited partnership interests 
if we issue additional common units  it will reduce our unitholders proportionate ownership interest in us 
this could cause the market price of the common units to fall and reduce the per unit cash distributions paid to our unitholders 
in addition  if we issued limited partnership units with voting rights superior to the common units  it could adversely affect our unitholders voting power 
our unitholders may not have limited liability in the circumstances described below and may be liable for the return of certain distributions 
under delaware law  our unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our general partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the control of our business 
the general partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of our partnership  such as its debts and environmental liabilities  except for those contractual obligations of our partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner 
in addition  section of the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act provides that  under certain circumstances  a unitholder may be liable for the amount of distribution for a period of three years from the date of distribution 
because we conduct our business in various states  the laws of those states may pose similar risks to our unitholders 
to the extent to which we conduct business in any state  our unitholders might be held liable for our obligations as if they were general partners if a court or government agency determined that we had not complied with that state s partnership statute  or if rights of unitholders constituted participation in the control of our business under that state s partnership statute 
in some of the states in which we conduct business  the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established 
we are dependent upon key personnel  and the loss of services of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations 
our continued success depends to a considerable extent upon the abilities and efforts of the senior management of our general partner  particularly william casey mcmanemin  its chief executive officer  james e 
raley  its chief operating officer  and h 
c 
allen  jr  its chief financial officer 
the loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have not obtained insurance or entered into employment agreements with any of these key personnel 
we are dependent on service providers who assist us with providing schedule k tax statements to our unitholders 
there are a very limited number of service firms that currently perform the detailed computations needed to provide each unitholder with estimated depletion and other tax information to assist the unitholder in various united states income tax computations 
there are also very few publicly traded limited partnerships that need these services 
as a result  the future costs and timeliness of providing schedule k tax statements to our unitholders is uncertain

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following information provides quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
market risk related to oil and natural gas prices essentially all of our assets and sources of income are from the net profits interests and the royalty properties  which generally entitle us to receive a share of the proceeds from oil and natural gas production on those properties 
consequently  we are subject to market risk from fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years 
we do not anticipate entering into financial hedging activities intended to reduce our exposure to oil and natural gas price fluctuations 
absence of interest rate and currency exchange rate risk we do not anticipate having a credit facility or incurring any debt  other than trade debt  following the combination 
therefore  we do not expect interest rate risk to be material to us 
we do not anticipate engaging in transactions in foreign currencies which could expose us to foreign currency related market risk
