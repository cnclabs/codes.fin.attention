management believes that cash on hand  cash flow from operations and funds made available under the new credit facility with whitehall  will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated working capital needs for at least the next twelve month period 
seasonality our business is subject to seasonal variations 
historically  we have realized a quarter of our total revenue and a majority of our net income for the year during the first fiscal quarter 
due to the importance of the holiday shopping season  any factors negatively impacting the holiday selling season could have an adverse effect on our revenues and our ability to generate a profit 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including the timing of new store openings and acquisitions and unexpected changes in volume related rebates or changes in cooperative advertising policies from manufacturers 
in addition  operating results may be negatively affected by increases in merchandise costs  price changes in response to competitive factors and unfavorable local  regional or national economic developments that result in reduced consumer spending 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  we cannot predict accurately the effect of inflation on future operating results 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to income taxes  inventory allowances  contingencies and to a lesser extent  bad debts 
we base our estimates on historical data  when available  experience  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies the accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
significant accounting policies are discussed in footnote to the financial statements  item inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
as such  materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operation and financial position include revenue recognition for the company  net sales and operating revenues include items related to normal business operations  including the sale of goods to customers and custom installation revenue 
retail sales are recorded at the time of the sale to the customer 
custom installation revenue  which is comprised of both the sale of products and the labor in connection with the installation of the products  are recorded in accordance with the provisions of eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the revenue related to the sale of the products is recognized when the product is delivered to the customers 
the revenue related to the labor in connection with the installation of the products  is recorded when the service has been performed 
inventory inventory is the company s largest asset class  comprising over of the company s total assets 
the company s inventory consists of finished goods held for retail sale 
purchase based volume rebates are credited to inventory or cost of products sold  as appropriate 
the company assesses the market value of its inventory on a regular basis by reviewing  on an item by item basis  the realizable value of its inventory  net of specific or general lower of cost or market reserves 
if it is management s judgment that the selling price of an item must be lowered below its cost in order for it to be sold  then the carrying value of the related inventory is written down to realizable value 
a number of factors would be taken into consideration in assessing realizable value including the quantity on hand  historical sales  technological advances  the existence of a replacement product  and consumer demand and preferences 
depending on market conditions  the actual amount received on sale could differ from management s estimate 
as a result we have reduced our net inventory value to reflect our estimated amount of inventory with lower of cost or market issues 
our inventory reserve at november  and october  is  and  respectively 
it is also possible that obsolescence could become a significant issue in the future 
long lived assets long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment  goodwill  and reorganization value are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we would recognize an impairment loss when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its value upon disposal are less than its carrying amount 
if our estimates regarding future undiscounted cash flows or useful lives were to change  we could be exposed to losses that are material in nature 
cash discounts and coop advertising we receive cash discounts for timely payment of merchandise invoices and recognize these amounts in our statement of operations as a reduction of cost of sales 
we also receive substantial funds from our suppliers for coop advertising 
these funds are used for advertising purposes and the funds earned are recorded net of advertising expenditures  and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
accrued expenses the company is constantly required to make estimates of future payments that will be made which relate to the current accounting period 
these estimates range from things such as accrued bonuses to estimates of pending litigation claims and income taxes 
in establishing appropriate accruals  management must make judgments regarding the amount of the disbursement that will ultimately be incurred 
in making such assessments  management uses historical experience as well as any other special circumstances surrounding a particular item 
the actual amount paid could differ from management s estimate 
recent accounting pronouncements prior to fiscal  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  and sfas no

the adoption of these standards in fiscal year did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or result of operations
