item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ace comm delivers enterprise telemanagement applications and advanced convergent mediation and operations support systems solutions to wired and wireless voice  data  and internet communications providers 
our solutions are tailored to each customer s needs and consist of hardware  software and related services that enable the capture  security  validation  correlation  augmentation  and warehousing of data from network elements and the distribution of this data in appropriate formats to oss operations support systems and bss business support systems operations 
our solutions also provide for centralized management and security of enterprise networks 
after completing the acquisition of technology and other assets of intasys billing technologies in the quarter ending march   ace comm now offers intasys line of wireless oss products and has commenced integrating the intasys technologies into our convergent mediation products 
ace comm derives revenues primarily from the sale of our products  including hardware and software  and related services 
ace comm enters into formal arrangements that provide for single or multiple deliverables of hardware  software and services 
these arrangements are formalized by either a simple purchase order or by more complex contracts such as development  reseller or master agreements 
these arrangements are generally us dollar denominated and typically have an aggregate value of several thousand to several million dollars and vary in length from days to several years  as in the case of master agreements 
agreements spanning several years are normally implemented in smaller statements of work or orders that are typically deliverable within three to twelve months 
our customers  including resellers  do not possess the right of return or exchange 
more frequently  we are entering into multiple element arrangements that do not involve significant modification or customization of the related software 
in these instances  ace comm allocates revenue to each element of the arrangement based on objective evidence of the element s fair value 
when an agreement provides for significant modification or customization of software  or when our system integration and product development are essential to the functionality of the software  revenues related to the software licenses and services are aggregated and the combined revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method is based on the estimated stage of completion of individual contracts determined on a cost or level of efforts basis 
any hardware or post contract customer support provided for under the terms of the agreement is unbundled 
hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery  which usually occurs upon transfer of title  and post contract customer support is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
most of our professional services are delivered in conjunction with our solutions and are sometimes essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
however  ace comm does sell unbundled services  and  in these instances  ace comm generally recognizes revenue as the services are performed 
revenue for a given period typically reflects products delivered or services performed during the period with respect to relatively large financial commitments from a small number of customers 
during  ace comm had major customers  which ace comm defines as generating  or more in revenues  that together represented approximately of total revenues 
giza systems  our largest customer in fiscal year  represented approximately of total revenues  and siemens ag contributed approximately of total revenues 
during  ace comm had major customers representing of total revenues 
siemens ag represented approximately of total revenues and northrop grumman contributed of total revenues earned during during  ace comm had major customers representing of total revenues 
siemens ag represented approximately of total revenues and northrop grumman contributed of total revenues earned during the average revenues earned per major customer were million in  million in  and million in to counteract the pressure on revenues from the prolonged downturn in demand in the telecommunications industry  we have been pursuing a growth strategy designed to expand our product line and areas of distribution 
the recent acquisition of i mobile and the purchase of assets from intasys are results of this strategy 
during the past three fiscal years  we have experienced significant net losses from operations  primarily due to reduced demand from our north american telecommunications customers 
to offset the effects of the current lower north american demand  we continue to target sales efforts toward what it believes to be a growing market for our convergent mediation solutions outside of north america and to acquire revenues by expanding our customer base and product offerings through acquisition 
during the year  we increased our revenues from outside of north america  in particular from the middle east and europe as a result of a previously announced order from telecom egypt and the purchase of the assets of intasys 
results for the year showed significant revenue and results of operations improvement in these areas excluding the one time charge for in process research and development 
on december   to improve our liquidity position  we consummated the acquisition of i mobile  inc under a merger agreement executed in september the acquisition was effected through the issuance of approximately million of shares of our common stock 
we accounted for the merger as a financing transaction and recorded the issuance of our common stock at the negotiated value and i mobile s cash on hand and liabilities assumed 
because i mobile ceased all revenue producing operations in march and we have no intention to revive i mobile s business subsequent to the merger  the merger does not possess the characteristics of a business combination found in both regulation s x and financial accounting standard no 
 business combinations  and eitf issue determining whether a non monetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets of a business 
as such  no goodwill resulted from this transaction as we did not employ purchase accounting 
on february   we completed our previously announced acquisition of oss solutions assets of intasys from mamma 
com  inc we paid million for the purchase of the intellectual property  customers  fixed assets and transaction related expenses 
there is up to an additional thousand of consideration that may be paid based upon certain earn out provisions of the asset purchase agreement to be determined during our next fiscal year 
due to the uncertainty surrounding this earn out  we intend to account for additional consideration which might be paid  if any  when it becomes known and probable 
in accordance with fas  we have allocated the purchase price based on an economic valuation of the purchased assets 
based upon this valuation  we recorded an intangible asset of thousand which is being amortized over sixty months related to the purchased customers and technology of intasys 
additionally  we recorded a charge of million in the third quarter associated with the purchase of in process research and development 
the acquisition of i mobile and the purchase of certain assets from intasys are expected to help us expand our revenues  product line and geographic presence 
we plan to pursue additional acquisitions or other strategic arrangements as well as the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts to increase revenues outside the north american market 
we also expect to focus for the next several months on integrating the acquired companies  training sales personnel on new products  contacting existing customers about cross selling opportunities and finding new customers for our expanded product line 
we have also focused our sales resources on opportunities for our netplus eoss products 
during two large customers substantially completed their purchases under existing contracts and were evaluating next generation solutions 
as a result  these customers purchased significantly less from us in in early fiscal we were notified that we had been awarded a multi year contract for our next generation solution from one of these customers 
we believe that this award will reverse the decline in revenues in our enterprise business beginning in critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations or require the application of significant judgment by our management 
the following is a brief discussion of these critical accounting policies revenue recognition ace comm derives revenues primarily from products  where a combination of hardware  proprietary licensed software  and services are offered to customers 
these products are typically formalized in a multiple element arrangement involving application of existing software capabilities or modification of the underlying software and implementation services 
our software licenses to end users generally provide for an initial license fee to use the product in perpetuity 
operational support systems revenue is recognized on a monthly basis based upon the number of telephone subscribers of our customers 
more frequently  we are entering into multiple element arrangements that do not involve significant modification or customization of the related software 
in these instances  ace comm recognizes revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  and allocates revenue to each element of the arrangement based on objective evidence of the element s fair value based on internal price listings developed by ace comm 
revenue for software licenses in these instances is recognized upon delivery ie  transfer of title  when a signed agreement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
the amount allocated to our maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the respective maintenance period 
in situations when our products involve significant modification or customization of software  or when our systems integration and product development are essential to the functionality of the software  revenues relating to the software licenses and services are aggregated and the combined revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
the hardware revenue on these contracts is recognized upon transfer of title  which generally occurs at the same time the licensed software is delivered 
revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method is based on the estimated stage of completion of individual contracts determined on a cost or level of efforts basis 
when our contracts contain extended payment terms  we defer recognition of revenue until amounts become due pursuant to payment schedules and no other uncertainties regarding collectibility exist 
we correspondingly defer a proportionate amount of contract cost which will be matched against the deferred revenue when recognized 
should management make the determination that previously deferred revenue will not be recognized  the corresponding amount of deferred contract cost will be charged to expense at that time 
our revenue recognition policy takes into consideration the creditworthiness of the customer in determining the probability of collection as a criterion for revenue recognition 
the determination of creditworthiness requires the exercise of judgment  which affects our revenue recognition 
if a customer is deemed to be not creditworthy  all revenue under arrangements with that customer is recognized only upon receipt of cash 
the creditworthiness of such customers is re assessed on a regular basis and revenue is deferred until cash is received 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through a charge to general and administrative expenses 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is an estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  individually and in aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
our customer base is highly concentrated in the telecommunications and internet service provider industries 
several of the leading companies in these industries have filed for bankruptcy 
if collection is not probable at the time the transaction is consummated  we do not recognize revenue until cash collection 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following sets forth selected consolidated data as a percentage of revenue for each of the following years ended june years ended june  revenue costs and expenses cost of revenue selling  general and administrative research and development loss from operations net interest expense loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss revenues total revenues in were million compared to million in and million in total revenues decreased million or in and million or in  in each case as compared to the prior year 
revenue growth depends  in part  on the overall demand for our product based solutions and on sales to large customers 
because our sales are primarily to telecommunication and internet service providers and enterprises  our ability to generate revenue also depends on specific conditions affecting those providers and on general economic conditions 
the decrease in revenues over the past three years reflects the continuing weak industry specific and general economic conditions negatively impacting demand for our products and services  primarily in north america 
additionally  our largest customer completed its purchases under our existing contract and initiated a procurement for a next generation solution 
revenue from sales to network service providers decreased from million to million for fiscal year and represented approximately of total revenue 
this decrease was primarily the result of a decline in revenues in china offset by an increase in revenues in the middle east 
revenue from sales to enterprises decreased from million to million during fiscal year  and represented approximately of total revenue 
revenues declined primarily as a result of a continued decline in purchases from two of our primary customers us army and air force and reduced demand  reflecting continuing weak conditions in the telecommunications sector 
revenue from sales of operations support systems solutions was million during fiscal year and represents of total revenue 
these revenues are derived principally from our new product line purchased from intasys in february backlog was million  as of june   compared to million as of june  this amount includes million related to a new product line based in large part on assets purchased from intasys in february  an increase of million related to network service providers and an increase of million related to enterprise sales 
we define backlog as future revenue from signed contracts or purchase orders for delivery of hardware and software products and services to be provided to customers generally within one year 
we have experienced fluctuations in our backlog at various times 
it anticipates that million of the backlog at june   will be recognized during fiscal year although we believe that our entire backlog consists of firm orders  our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual revenue for any future period because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules and delays inherent in the contracting process 
revenues in were at approximately the same level as and significantly less than revenues increased from the inclusion of five months of the revenues from a new product line based in large part on assets purchased from intasys in february  offset by a decline in revenues from enterprise customers who had nearly completed their purchases under existing contracts 
we believe that as a result of the inclusion of the revenues from the asset purchase of intasys for a full year and the revenues generated from our backlog will increase in at this time  we cannot predict whether the increase in revenues will enable us to make a profit during cost of revenues our cost of revenue consists primarily of direct labor costs  direct material costs  and allocable indirect costs 
the expenses for services provided by certain alliance partners in connection with the installation and integration of our products may also be included 
cost of revenue was million in  million in  and million in  representing   and of total revenues in each year  respectively 
cost of revenues increased million or in primarily as the result of the inclusion of the costs associated with the operations of the recently acquired intasys assets offset by a decrease in other costs and decreased million or in  as compared to the prior year  reflecting a decrease in labor and labor related costs  as we further decreased staffing levels in response to the continuing decline in demand for our products within the telecommunications sector 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of costs to support our sales and administrative functions 
sales expenses consist primarily of salary  commission  travel  trade show  bid and proposal  and other related selling and marketing expenses required to sell our products to target markets 
general and administrative expenses consist of provision for doubtful accounts and unallocated costs related to our information systems infrastructure  facilities  finance and accounting  legal  human resources and corporate management 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in  representing   and of total revenues in each year  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or in  decreased million or in and decreased million or in  as compared to each prior corresponding period 
the increase in results from the additional selling  general and administrative costs associated with the acquisition of assets from intasys  and increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and an increase in selling expenses for our existing product lines 
the decrease in and is primarily the result of a continuing effort to reduce expenses  which includes company and employee initiated reductions in personnel  and reductions in rent  travel  consulting and professional fees 
we recognized a net provision for doubtful accounts of million in  compared to a net provision for doubtful accounts of million in and million in  representing an increase of million in and a decrease of million in in each case as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
during  one of our customers experienced negative financial conditions to the extent which required us to provide extensively for its respective receivable  as compared to in which very few of our customers experienced negative financial conditions 
we believe that these difficulties will not continue to be encountered with our current customers 
however  existing or future customers ability to pay us may be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic conditions or by other factors 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of personnel costs and the associated infrastructure costs required to support the design and development of our products such as jbill global and netplus 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in research and development expenses increased million or in and decreased 
million or in and million or in  as compared to each prior corresponding period 
research and development expenses represented of revenues in  of revenues in  and of revenues in the increase in research and development in is primarily due to the inclusion of the research and development expenses associated with the acquisition of assets of intasys 
the decrease in research and development in and  over the prior corresponding periods  reflects a decrease in resources applied to research and development 
we were selective in approving new projects and in some instances discontinued projects that were not related to the development of convergent mediation tm solutions 
in some instances we charge our customers for development which we include in cost of revenues 
based upon the uncertain north american market  we decided to explore opportunities to license or acquire new technology from third parties as a strategy for expanding our product offerings 
the purchase of the assets of intasys is an example of this strategy 
during  we accelerated the development efforts for certain of our products to meet customer demands 
we did not capitalize software development costs in  or in because our product development methodology generally establishes technological feasibility near the end of the development process 
liquidity and capital resources asset and cash flow analysis at june  our primary source of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of million  and also a million working capital line of credit 
cash and cash equivalents were million at june   and million at june  the cash and cash equivalents balance increased by million  or  in and decreased by million  or  in  in each case as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
the increase in was primarily the result of the inclusion of cash acquired from i mobile offset by the operating loss for the year and the purchase of assets of intasys 
the decrease in was primarily the result of funding operating losses offset by non cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses 
cash and cash equivalents were of total assets at june  compared to at june  working capital was million at june  million at june   and million at june  working capital increased million  or  in  decreased million  or in and decreased million  or  in  in each case as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
the decrease in working capital in was primarily the result of operating losses  net of depreciation and amortization in excess of purchased assets offset by the net increase in working capital acquired in the i mobile transaction 
accounts receivables decreased  or at june   and increased million  or to million at june  five customers represented of our gross trade receivables balance as of june   with one international customer representing of our gross trade receivables balance as of june  the decrease in accounts receivable at june  is primarily the result of the receipt of payments from some aged receivables and a decrease in revenues in the fourth quarter of offset by the inclusion of receivables from the purchased assets of intasys 
the increase in accounts receivable at june  is primarily the result of an increase in international customers who traditionally have taken longer to pay and to an increase in instances where payments are scheduled over an extended period of time  in no case greater than one year 
our operating activities used million in cash during  million in cash during  and used million in cash during the changes between years in cash flows from operating activities are principally due to changes in net income loss after adjustments for non cash charges such as depreciation and changes in working capital amounts 
changes in accounts receivable balances are typically the most significant component of working capital and fluctuate as a result of the timing and volume of our revenues and other factors 
net cash used for investing activities was million in due to the contract rights purchased from intasys and cash used for investing activities was million  and million  in   respectively  representing capital purchases of computer equipment 
our financing activities generated cash of million in  primarily resulting from the common stock issued associated with the i mobile transaction and generated million in and used cash of million in we had positive cash flows from financing activities in as a result of additional borrowings and net cash generated from a strategic partner acquiring  shares of our common stock 
no significant financings took place during additionally  borrowings and other financial obligations resulted in a net cash inflow of million in  million in  and an outflow of million in cost containment program as a result of declining revenues during the past three fiscal years  we have initiated numerous cost reduction measures which have significantly lowered operating expenses 
during the past three fiscal years the number of full time employees  excluding assets purchased from intasys  have been reduced 
this reduction was designed to reduce costs without materially impacting our ability to maintain our historical levels of customer involvement and technological innovation  especially in areas of focus such as china 
additionally  we have developed contingency plans to reduce expenses further  should revenues levels warrant such action 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of june  and the effect such commitments could have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period amounts in thousands contractual obligation total less than year years years after years operating leases we have commercial commitments of an accounts receivable backed line of credit that expired on august  the outstanding balance at june  was million
