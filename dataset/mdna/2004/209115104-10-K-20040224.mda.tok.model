the companies are each subject to certain material contingencies  including certain utility environmental matters and con edison s legal proceedings relating to its october agreement to acquire northeast utilities 
see application of critical accounting policies accounting for contingencies  below 
regulated utility subsidiaries con edison of new york provides electric service to over million customers and gas service to million customers in new york city and westchester county 
the company also provides steam service in parts of manhattan 
o r  along with its regulated utility subsidiaries  provides electric service to over  customers in southeastern new york and adjacent sections of new jersey and northeastern pennsylvania and gas service to over  customers in southeastern new york and northeastern pennsylvania 
the utilities are primarily wires and pipes energy delivery companies that are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
pursuant to restructuring agreements  the utilities have sold most of their electric generating capacity and provide their customers the opportunity to buy electricity and gas directly from other suppliers through the utilities retail access programs 
the utilities supply more than half of the energy delivered by them in their service areas and provide delivery service to their customers that buy energy from other suppliers 
the utilities purchase substantially all of the energy they supply to customers pursuant to firm contracts or through wholesale energy markets 
in general  the utilities recover on a current basis the fuel and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full service customers  pursuant to approved rate plans 
con edison anticipates that the utilities will provide substantially all of its earnings over the next few years 
the utilities earnings will depend on various factors including demand for utility service and the utilities ability to charge rates for their services that reflect the costs of service  including a return on invested equity capital 
demand for utility service is affected by weather  economic conditions and other factors 
the utilities have experienced increased customer demand in recent years 
in june  july and august of  both con management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison  con edison of new york and o r continued edison of new york and o r set new three month electric delivery records of more than million and million megawatt hours  respectively 
in june  con edison of new york and o r each experienced a new record electric peak load for that month 
the june peak was an all time peak electric load for o r 
in january  con edison of new york and o r each experienced a new winter electricity peak load 
because the energy delivery infrastructure must be adequate to meet demand in peak periods with a high level of reliability  the utilities capital investment plans reflect in great part actual growth in electric peak load adjusted to summer design weather conditions  as well as forecast growth in peak loads 
on this basis  con edison of new york s weather adjusted peak load in the summer of was  mw  percent higher than the adjusted peak load in the forecast annual growth in the electric peak load over the next five years is percent 
the company anticipates an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet this load growth with the exceptionally high level of reliability that it currently provides see capital requirements  below 
the utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the rates they can charge their customers 
con edison of new york has an electric rate agreement approved in november that ends march and gas and steam rate agreements approved in april and november  respectively that end in september these agreements do not reflect all of the increased construction expenditures and related costs incurred and expected to be incurred to meet increasing customer demand and reliability needs that have been experienced since the date of those agreements see capital requirements  below 
the company filed petitions in november to increase rates for gas and steam service effective october and expects to file a petition in april to increase rates for electric service effective april o r has rate agreements for its electric and gas services in new york that extend through october the rate plans generally require the utilities to share with customers earnings in excess of specified rates of return on equity 
changes in energy sales and delivery volumes are reflected in operating income except to the extent that weather normalization provisions apply to the gas businesses 
rates charged to customers  pursuant to these agreements  may not be changed during the respective terms of these agreements other than for recovery of energy costs and limited other exceptions

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison  con edison of new york and o r continued application of critical accounting policies the companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies  which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the companies critical accounting policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies  long lived assets  derivative instruments  goodwill and leases 
the critical accounting policies are as follows accounting for regulated public utilities sfas no 
the utilities are subject to sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and  in accordance with sfas no 
 are subject to the accounting requirements of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction 
sfas no 
specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise 
revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred 
if regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future  these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under sfas no 
if revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future  these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under sfas no 
the utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in note b to the financial statements 
the utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made 
the utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received 
the regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers  or applied for customer benefit  in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits the utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees 
con edison s unregulated subsidiaries also provide such benefits to certain of their employees 
the companies account for these benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
in applying these accounting policies  the companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions  including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets  future compensation  health care cost trends and appropriate discount rates 
see notes e and f to the financial statements for information about these assumptions  actual performance  amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison  con edison of new york and o r continued primarily because of the amortization of previous years net investment gains  con edison of new york s pension expense for  and was negative  resulting in a credit to and increase in net income in each year 
investment gains and losses on plan assets are fully recognized in expense over a year period percent of the gains and losses for each year begin to amortize in each of the following five years and the amortization period for each percent portion of the gains and losses is ten years 
this amortization is in accordance with the statement of policy issued by the new york public service commission psc and is permitted under sfas no 
the cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets and assumptions for future periods 
con edison s current estimate for is a reduction  compared with  in the pension and other postretirement benefits net credit of million after tax for con edison of new york and an increase  compared to  in pension and other postretirement benefits expense of million for o r 
this reduction reflects  among other factors  the amortization of prior period actuarial losses associated with declines in the market value of assets in recent years  partially offset by the amortization of a gain on plan assets in and by the estimated impact in of recently enacted medicare legislation reduction in other postretirement benefit costs of million after tax  including million for con edison of new york and million for o r 
amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to reduce con edison of new york s pension and other post retirement benefit net credit by an additional million  after tax  in a percentage point variation in the actual annual return in as compared with the expected annual asset return of percent would change net income for con edison and con edison of new york by approximately million in  assuming no change in regulatory treatment 
in accordance with sfas no 
and consistent with rate provisions approved by the psc  o r defers as a regulatory asset any difference between expenses recognized under sfas no 
and the amounts reflected in rates for such expenses 
con edison of new york s pending petitions for gas and steam rate increases include  and the company anticipates that its petition for an electric rate increase will include  a proposal for deferred accounting treatment of such expenses 
see regulatory matters  below 
pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by con edison to which con edison of new york  o r and the unregulated subsidiaries make contributions for their participating employees 
pension accounting by the utilities includes an allocation of plan assets 
an actuarial valuation of the plan s funded status as of december   showed that the fair value of the plan s assets exceeded  by million  the plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo at that date 
however  the fair market value of the plan assets could fall below the plan s abo in future years 
in that event  each of the utilities would be required  under sfas no 
 to accrue a liability equal in amount to the difference between its share of the fair value of the plan assets and its portion of the abo  plus  in the case of con edison of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison  con edison of new york and o r continued new york  its total prepaid pension costs  through a non cash charge to other comprehensive income oci 
the charge to oci  which would be net of taxes  would not affect net income for common stock 
the companies were not required to make cash contributions to their pension plans in under funding regulations and tax laws 
o r made a discretionary contribution of million to the plan in in  o r and con edison s unregulated subsidiaries expect to make discretionary contributions of million and million  respectively 
the companies policy is to fund its accounting cost to the extent it is tax deductible 
accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  applies to an existing condition  situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
known material contingencies include the utilities responsibility for hazardous substances  such as asbestos  polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations  workers compensation claims and con edison s legal proceedings relating to its october merger agreement with northeast utilities 
see notes g  k  q  r  s  t and w to the financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated 
accounting for long lived assets sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
under sfas no 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows  and exceeds its fair value  which approximates market value 
the adverse market conditions affecting con edison s unregulated telecommunications and generation businesses led to the testing of their assets for impairment in a critical element of this test is the forecast of future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the long lived assets 
forecast of these cash flows requires complex judgments about future operations  which are particularly difficult to make with respect to evolving industries such as the energy related and telecommunications businesses 
under sfas no 
 if alternative courses of action are under consideration or if a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows  the probability of those possible outcomes must be weighted 
as a result of the tests performed in  con edison recognized impairment charges of million management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison  con edison of new york and o r continued million after tax for the assets of its unregulated telecommunications and generation businesses 
see note h to the financial statements 
accounting for derivative instruments the companies apply sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and other related accounting pronouncements to their derivative financial instruments 
the companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities 
see financial and commodity market risks below and note p to the financial statements 
accounting for goodwill con edison adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january  in accordance with this standard  con edison ceased amortizing goodwill and began testing remaining goodwill balances for impairment on an annual basis 
con edison completed initial goodwill impairment tests and recorded a loss of million million after tax as of january   relating to certain generation assets owned by an unregulated subsidiary 
the unamortized goodwill of million  relating to the acquisition of o r  was tested for impairment and determined not to be impaired 
see note l to the financial statements 
in determining whether or not its goodwill is impaired  con edison is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that could affect the results of the goodwill impairment test 
actual results could differ from the estimates used 
accounting for leases the companies apply sfas no 
 accounting for leases and other related accounting pronouncements to their leasing transactions 
see notes k and t to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below 
the principal factors affecting con edison s liquidity at the holding company level are its investments in the utilities  the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the utilities 
in addition  in con edison issued million shares of common stock for million million of which it invested in con edison of new york and million of five year debt 
in  the company issued million of year debt most of which it invested in its unregulated subsidiaries 
the principal factors affecting the utilities liquidity are the cash flow generated from operations  construction expenditures and maturities of their debt securities 
in addition  con edison of new york in received a million capital contribution from con edison  in and issued million and million  respectively  of additional debt net of redemptions  and in received management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison  con edison of new york and o r continued net proceeds of million from the sale of generating assets  net of a contribution to its nuclear decommissioning trust see note j to the financial statements

in  o r redeemed million of debt at maturity with commercial paper 
the companies each believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short term and long term cash requirements  assuming that the utilities rate plans reflect their costs of service  including a return on invested capital

operating activities investing activities financing activities net change for the period balance at beginning of period balance at end of period including restricted cash cash flows from operating activities the utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations 
the volume of energy sales and deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the utilities  such as weather and economic conditions 
the prices at which the utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with rate plans approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction the psc  the new jersey board of public utilities njbpu and the pennsylvania public utility commission ppuc 
see regulatory matters below 
in general  changes in the utilities cost of purchased power  fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans 
see recoverable energy costs in note a to the financial statements 
net income for common stock is the result of cash and non cash or accrual transactions 
only cash transactions affect the companies cash flows from operating activities 
principal non cash charges include depreciation and deferred taxes  and for con edison in  impairment charges 
for con edison of new york  principal non cash credits include prepaid pension costs 
pension credits result from past favorable performance in con edison of new york s pension fund and assumptions about future performance 
see application of critical accounting policies accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits and notes e and f to the financial statements 
net cash flows from operating activities in for con edison and con edison of new york were million and million lower than  respectively 
this decrease reflects lower net income at con edison of new york due to a certain extent to costs not reflected in current rates and for con edison due to greater losses at the unregulated subsidiaries 
this decrease also reflects con edison of new york s increase in the value of gas in storage reflecting both higher unit costs and higher volumes and a higher level of accrued construction commitments at year end that were paid for in this decrease was partially offset by an increase in deferred income tax expense 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison  con edison of new york and o r continued net cash flows from operating activities in for o r were million higher than in due primarily to increased deferred income tax expense  partially offset by the increased value of gas in storage resulting from higher unit costs and volumes 
net cash flows from operating activities in for con edison were million lower than in this decrease was due principally to higher energy costs and sales at the utilities in december as compared with december  resulting in increased customer accounts receivable and recoverable energy costs  offset in part by increased accounts payable balances 
the net benefit to cash flows from these activities in was greater than the benefit in because high energy costs at year end were collected in and energy purchases at year end were lower than the prior year 
the change in cash flows also reflects the timing of federal income tax payments and refunds for the utilities and net cash received related to regulatory liabilities  such as transmission congestion contracts  offset by increased cash expended related to regulatory assets 
net cash flows from operating activities in for con edison of new york were million higher than in the change in cash flows reflects the aforementioned impact of the timing of energy sales and cost recovery  the timing of federal income tax payments and refunds  and cash received or expended related to regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities for con edison were million lower in than in  due primarily to lower construction expenditures by its unregulated subsidiaries  partially offset by increased construction expenditures by the utilities

regulatory matters for additional information about the electric  gas and steam agreements discussed below  see rate and restructuring agreements in note b to the financial statements 
electric in july  ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr to establish a standard market design smd for wholesale electricity markets across the country 
the proposed smd has many of the elements of the markets that have been established in the northeast  and if adopted  could facilitate transactions among energy markets across the country 
after receiving over  comments on the proposals contained in its smd nopr  the ferc issued its wholesale market platform white paper on april  the white paper built on the existing rules contained in order key among the attributes discussed in the white paper are flexibility on the scope and configuration to allow for both independent system operators isos and regional transmission organizations rtos  the need for a regional planning process  the need for rate mechanisms that minimize cost shifts  the need to eliminate seams charges between isos and rtos  the use of a real time market for energy to resolve imbalances  and the need for an approach to manage congestion  which could include locational pricing with firm transmission rights  that protects against manipulation  utilizes the grid effectively and promotes the use of lower cost generation 
in addition  each region within an rto or iso will determine how it will ensure that its region has sufficient resources to meet customers needs 
since releasing its white paper  the ferc has held technical conferences on various issues 
however  it has not issued any specific orders for compliance 
the energy bill introduced in congress in contained a provision remanding smd to the ferc and requiring that no new rule could be issued before october  or could become effective before december  the energy bill was not passed in the senate leadership has stated its intent to bring the bill up for vote again in in september  the psc approved a restructuring agreement among con edison of new york  the psc staff and certain other parties the restructuring agreement

the most significant market risks include interest rate risk  commodity price risk  credit risk and investment risk 
interest rate risk the interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements  including the construction expenditures of the utilities and maturing debt securities 
con edison and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt 
con edison estimates that  as of december   each percent variation in interest rates applicable to the companies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison  con edison of new york and o r continued variable rate debt of million would result in a change in annual interest expense of million 
for each percent change in con edison of new york s and o r s variable interest rates applicable to their variable rate debt of million and million  respectively  annual interest expense for con edison of new york would change by million and there would be no material impact for o r 
in addition  con edison and its subsidiaries  from time to time  enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities 
see interest rate hedging in note p to the financial statements 
commodity price risk con edison s commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity  gas and related derivative instruments 
the utilities and con edison s unregulated subsidiaries have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures 
see note p to the financial statements 
con edison estimates that  as of december   each percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of million for the derivative instruments used by the utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas  of which million is for con edison of new york and million for o r 
con edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased 
in accordance with provisions approved by state regulators  the utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers  including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs 
see recoverable energy costs in note a to the financial statements 
con edison s unregulated subsidiaries use a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed price purchase and sales commitments  physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments 
var represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors  for a specified time period and confidence level 
the unregulated subsidiaries estimate var across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta normal variance covariance model with a percent confidence level 
since the var calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience  it is not necessarily indicative of future results 
var for transactions associated with hedges on generating assets and commodity contracts  assuming a one day holding period  for the years ended december   and  respectively  was as follows confidence level  one day holding period millions of dollars average for the period high low management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison  con edison of new york and o r continued credit risk the companies are exposed to credit risk related to over the counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the utilities and the unregulated energy subsidiaries 
credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterparty s nonperformance 
the companies use credit policies to manage this risk  including an established credit approval process  monitoring of counterparty limits  master netting agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements 
the companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions 
the replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains  net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff 
con edison s unregulated energy subsidiaries had million of credit exposure  net of collateral and reserves  at december   of which million was with investment grade counterparties and million was with the new york mercantile exchange or independent system operators 
investment risk the companies investment risk relates to the investment of the assets of their pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
see application of critical accounting policies accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits  above 
the companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of percent equities and percent fixed income and other securities 
at december   the pension plan investments consisted of percent equity and percent fixed income and other securities

contracts that did not fall within the scope of sfas no 
were included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle recognized in december see note p to the financial statements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison  con edison of new york and o r continued the changes in fair value of energy trading net assets for the years ended december  and were as follows twelve months ended december  millions of dollars fair value of net assets outstanding beginning of period change in fair value during the period unrealized gain at inception net premium paid received cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle changes in fair value prior to settlement fair value realized at settlement of contracts total change in fair value during the period fair value of net assets outstanding end of period as of december   the sources of fair value of the energy trading net assets were as follows millions of dollars fair value of net assets at period end source of fair value maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity in excess of years total fair value prices provided by external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods total prices provided by external sources represent the fair value of exchange traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources 
prices based on models and other valuation methods represent the fair value of positions calculated using internal models when directly and indirectly quoted external prices or prices derived from external sources are not available 
internal models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present value of cash flows based on underlying contractual terms 
the models reflect management s estimates  taking into account observable market prices  estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices  the risk free market discount rate  volatility factors  estimated correlations of energy commodity prices and contractual volumes 
counterparty specific credit quality  market price uncertainty and other risks are also factored into the models 
environmental matters for information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos  see note g to the financial statements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison  con edison of new york and o r continued impact of inflation the companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation 
regulation permits the utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the asset upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs 
the impact is  however  partially offset by the repayment of the companies long term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed 
also  to the extent the companies prices change by more or less than inflation  the real price of the companies services will increase or decline 
over the past years  for example  the real price of electric service has declined substantially
