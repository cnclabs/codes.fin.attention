general the purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
reference should be made to those statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report for an understanding of the following discussion and analysis 
historical results of operations and any trends which may appear  are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future years 
business acquisitions on august   we completed the acquisition of baldwin bancshares  inc  the parent company of first national bank of the south in milledgeville  georgia 
the company issued  shares of its capital stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding common shares of baldwin bancshares  inc the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase resulting in goodwill of approximately  the results of operations for the year ended december  include the results of operations for fnb since the date of acquisition  which represents four months of operations 
the year ended december  does not include results of operations for fnb 
the results of operations for the year ended december   includes twelve months of operations for htb compared to one month of operations included in the year ended december  due to the acquisition of htb being consummated on november  summary during and  we continued to experience moderate internal growth in interest earning and total assets which was funded by increases in deposits  borrowings  and the retention of net profits 
during  we experienced additional growth through the acquisition of fnb as explained below 
we recorded net income of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total equity at december  increased to  from  or  from december  the aforementioned acquisition of fnb accounted for  of this increase 
balance sheets our total assets increased million or for the year ended december  compared to million or for the same period in the acquisition of fnb accounted for approximately million of this increase 
the increase in total assets for the year ended december   exclusive of fnb  consists primarily of an increase in interest earning assets of million or compared to an increase of million or during the same period in  exclusive of htb 
the overall growth in and is consistent with management s plans 
the competition for deposits plays an important role in the overall growth of the company 
our primary focus is to maximize earnings through lending activities 
any excess funds are invested according to our investment policy 
total loans increased or million for the year ended december  exclusive of fnb  which represented million of this increase  total loans increased 
this increase is compared to an increase of or million during exclusive of htb  which represented million of this increase  total loans increased 
as of december   our loan to deposit ratio was compared to in at december  and  we had total outstanding borrowings of million and million  respectively 
these funds have been used to fund loan growth 
the utilization of borrowings to fund loan growth enables us to maintain a higher loan to deposit ratio and maintain an adequate liquidity ratio 
our loan to funds ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
during  total deposits grew by million  or 
exclusive of fnb  which accounted for million of this increase  total deposits grew million or compared to an increase of million or in  exclusive of htb 
the increase in  exclusive of fnb  consists primarily of an increase in interest bearing deposits of million or compared to an increase of million or during the specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio  especially the real estate portfolio  include  but are not limited to  a general downturn in the economy which could affect unemployment rates in our market areas  general real estate market deterioration  interest rate fluctuations  deteriorated collateral  title defects  inaccurate appraisals  and financial deterioration of borrowers 
construction and development lending can also present other specific risks to the lender such as whether developers can find builders to buy lots for home construction  whether the builders can obtain financing for the construction  whether the builders can sell the home to a buyer  and whether the buyer can obtain permanent financing 
currently  real estate values and employment trends in our market areas have remained stable 
the general economy and loan demand declined slightly during and continued to decline throughout in  the economy began to show signs of improvement 
our growth has not been significantly impacted by the previously mentioned economic conditions 
we attempt to reduce these economic and credit risks not only by adherence to our lending policy  which includes loan to value guidelines  but also by investigating the creditworthiness of the borrower and monitoring the borrower s financial position 
also  we periodically review our lending policies and procedures 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity management involves the matching of the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors desiring to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs and our ability to meet those needs 
we seek to meet liquidity requirements primarily through management of short term investments  monthly amortizing loans  maturing single payment loans  and maturities of securities and prepayments 
also  we maintain relationships with correspondent banks which could provide funds on short notice 
as of december   we had borrowed under federal funds purchase lines and securities sold under repurchase agreements million compared to million as of december  these borrowings typically mature within one to four business days 
the following table sets forth certain information about contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due after december  total year or less years years after years subordinated debt   operating leases  capital commitments   federal home loan bank advances     total contractual cash obligations    the company s operating leases represent short term obligations  normally with maturities of one year or less 
many of the operating leases have thirty day cancellation provisions 
the total contractual obligations for operating leases do not require a material amount of the company s cash funds 
our liquidity and capital resources are monitored on a periodic basis by management and state and federal regulatory authorities 
at december   our liquidity ratio was which was above our policy minimum ratio of 
management reviews liquidity on a periodic basis to monitor and adjust liquidity as necessary 
management has the ability to adjust liquidity by selling securities available for sale  selling participations in loans and accessing available funds through various borrowing arrangements 
at december   we had available borrowing capacity totaling approximately million through various borrowing arrangements and available lines of credit 
we believe our short term investments and available borrowing arrangements are adequate to cover any reasonably anticipated immediate need for funds 
at december   our capital to asset ratios were considered well capitalized  with the exception of fnb  based on guidelines established by the regulatory authorities 
subsequent to december   the company has injected sufficient capital into fnb to return fnb to well capitalized status 
at december   our total capital to risk weighted assets ratio was  our tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio was  and our tier capital to average assets ratio was 
during  we increased our capital by retaining net earnings of million 
management is not aware of any known trends  events or uncertainties  other than those discussed above  that will have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
management is also not aware of any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities which  if they were implemented  would have such an effect 
the banks are subject to certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that may be declared without prior regulatory approval 
at december   approximately  of retained earnings at the banks were available for dividend declaration without regulatory approval 
off balance sheet financing the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and credit card commitments 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
at december   we had outstanding commitments to extend credit through open lines of credit of approximately million and outstanding standby letters of credit of approximately million 
effects of inflation the impact of inflation on banks differs from its impact on non financial institutions 
banks  as financial intermediaries  have assets which are primarily monetary in nature and which tend to fluctuate in concert with inflation 
a bank can reduce the impact of inflation if it can manage its rate sensitivity gap 
this gap represents the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
through our asset liability committees  we attempt to structure the assets and liabilities and manage the rate sensitivity gap  thereby seeking to minimize the potential effects of inflation 
for information on the management of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  see the asset liability management section in item of this report 
results of operations for the years ended december   and our profitability is determined by our ability to effectively manage interest income and expense  to minimize loan and security losses  to generate noninterest income  and to control operating expenses 
because interest rates are determined by market forces and economic conditions beyond our control  our ability to generate net interest income depends upon our ability to obtain an adequate net interest spread between the rate earned on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net yield on average interest earning assets decreased to in from in this decrease is attributable primarily to decreases in rates 
in  the average yield on interest earning assets decreased to from in and the average yield on interest bearing liabilities decreased to in from in the overall change in the interest rate spread from to was a decrease of basis points 
the decrease in the net interest spread is a result of increases in loan volume  which are not being offset by decreases in rates 
total average interest earning assets increased by million  to  at december  from the same period of and average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  to  for the same period 
the net yield on average interest earning assets increased by basis points to from for the year ended december  as compared to the increased net yield in was primarily attributable to increases in loan volume and the significant decrease in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income 
net interest income increased by  to million in  compared to an increase of  in the increase for both years continues to reflect the continued increase in interest earning assets during and as shown in table and table included in this annual report  the change in net interest income is the result of the increases in net volume versus changes in net interest rates 
provision for loan loss 
provisions for loan losses increased by  during compared to a decrease of  during the provision for loan losses is the charge to operations which management believes is necessary to fund the allowance for loan losses 
this provision is based on management s periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
our evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses  and may require the company to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
see also allowance discussion in the critical accounting policies section of this k 
the following table presents details of the provision for loan loss  nonaccrual loans and related categories for each subsidiary as well as on a consolidated basis 
the increase in the provision for loan losses in was primarily due to a provision taken at htb for  that directly relates to one loan relationship commented on by its regulators 
the loan is currently performing and is secured by real estate 
the company believes that there is sufficient collateral to cover this loan 
the consumer related charge offs consist of many smaller balance loans while the real estate charge offs consist of only a few larger balance loans 
real estate loans are normally secured by one to four family residences or other real estate with values exceeding the original loan balance  therefore minimizing the risk of loss 
consumer loans  however  may be secured by consumer goods and automobiles  or may be unsecured  and therefore subject to greater loss in the event of charge off 
during a recession  losses are more likely and the risk of loss is greater in the consumer portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans at december  was  which was up from in this increase is due to nonaccrual loans decreasing to  at december  from  at december  this decrease in nonaccrual loans was primarily attributable to htb whose nonaccrual loan balance at december  was  and at december  was  offsetting this decrease  was an increase at one subsidiary in nonaccrual loans of  representing one loan relationship 
during the same period  other problem loans  including past due loans greater than days past due  decreased by  compared to a increase of  in the decrease in past due loans is attributable to the loan mentioned above of  moving from past due status to nonaccrual 
based on management s evaluations  management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb potential losses on existing loans

allowance nonaccrual loans other income 
other income increased during by  compared to an increase of  in for the year ended december   the most significant portion of the net increase consisted of an increase of  in service charges on deposit accounts and an increase of  in mortgage origination fees 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in security transactions  net of  for the same period in  service charges increased by  and mortgage origination fees increased by  the increase in service charges was related to growth in transaction accounts and new service charge income related to a new product 
the increase in mortgage origination fees is directly related to the decrease in the prime rate which also impacts the mortgage rates 
in a decreasing rate environment  refinancing of mortgage loans has provided an excellent opportunity for us to generate other fee income 
other expense 
other expense increased  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
increases in salaries and employee benefits represent the most significant portions of these increases  which increased by  and  for the years ended and  respectively 
the number of full time equivalent employees increased by from december of to december of  of which related to the acquisition of fnb 
in addition to the additional salary expense related to new employees  we incurred increases due to increases in profit sharing contributions  health insurance costs  incentive compensation and normal salary increases for the years ended december  and other operating expenses increased by  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and the increase in other operating expenses in included increases in marketing and public relations of  atm and data processing expenses of  supplies  postage and telephone expenses of  and a loss recorded on the sale of a building of  income tax expense

net income increased by  for the year ended december   or by 
the increase in net income for the same period in was  or 
the increase in net income in was due primarily to significant growth in interest earning assets and increased non interest income 
the increase in net income in was the net of a combination of significant growth in interest earning assets  moderate increases in other expenses  a decrease in provision for loan losses and increased non interest income

table rate and volume analysis the following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and expense during the years indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to change in volume change in volume multiplied by old rate  change in rate change in rate multiplied by old volume  and a combination of change in rate and change in volume 
the changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

the objective of this policy is to monitor interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities so as to minimize the impact of substantial movements in interest rates on earnings 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within the time period analyzed  usually one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within such time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we also evaluate how the repayment of particular assets and liabilities is impacted by changes in interest rates 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors which limit the amount of changes in interest rates 
prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates 
changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position 
we currently price deposits in response to market rates and it is management s intention to continue this policy 
if deposits are not priced in response to market rates  a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position 
at december  our cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap ratio was 
our targeted ratio is to in this time horizon 
this indicates that our interest bearing liabilities will reprice during this period at a rate faster than our interest earning assets 
the following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie  interest rate sensitive assets less interest rate sensitive liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitive liabilities and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
the table also sets forth the time periods in which interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
however  the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers 
in addition  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates

except for its effect on the general level of interest rates  inflation does not have a material impact on us due to the rate variability and short term maturities of our earning assets 
in particular  approximately of the loan portfolio is comprised of loans which have variable rate terms or mature within one year

this status is determined when  there is a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and full repayment of principal and interest is not expected  and the principal or interest is more than days past due  unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection 
accrual of interest on such loans is resumed when  in management s judgment  the collection of interest and principal becomes probable 
loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard  or special mention that have not been included in the table above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources 
these classified loans do not represent material credits about which management is aware and which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
in the event of non performance by the borrower  these loans have collateral pledged which would prevent the recognition of substantial losses 
commitments and lines of credit we will  in the normal course of business  commit to extend credit in the form of letters of credit  lines of credit  and credit cards 
the amount of outstanding loan commitments at december  and was million and million  respectively 
these commitments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the financial instruments become payable 
we use the same credit and collateral policies for these off balance sheet commitments as we do for financial instruments that are recorded in the financial statements 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitment amounts expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements

management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the subsidiary banks allowances for loan losses 
such agencies may require the subsidiary banks to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination

short term borrowings other borrowings as part of our operating strategy  we have utilized federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements as an alternative to retail deposits to fund our operations when borrowings are less costly and can be invested at a positive interest rate spread or when we need additional funds to satisfy loan demand 
by utilizing federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements  which possess varying stated maturities  we can meet our liquidity needs without otherwise being dependent upon retail deposits and revising our deposit rates to attract retail deposits  which have no stated maturities  except for certificates of deposit  which are interest rate sensitive and which are subject to withdrawal from us at any time

actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that our determination of the allowance for loan losses affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
the allowance for loan losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio 
the company uses an point rating system for its loans 
ratings of to are considered pass ratings  is special mention  is substandard  is doubtful  and is loss 
the originating officer rates all loans on this system 
this rating is adjusted from time to time by the officer to accurately reflect the loan s current status 
these ratings are reviewed regularly by the loan committee  an outside independent loan review firm  our accountants  and by the applicable regulator for accuracy 
pass loans are separated into homogeneous pools 
currently  these pools consist of real estate  commercial  consumer and credit card 
management assigns loss percentages to these categories of homogeneous pools of loans based on historic loss data in each category 
in addition to the homogeneous pools management has specified certain industry risks and applied loss percentages to the specified industry risk categories 
management is developing moving average net losses for the historic loss percentage in each category 
these loss percentages will be reviewed and adjusted periodically  by pool  in light of current trends in past dues  changes in lending policies  underwriting standards  economic conditions  and other factors that may affect this number 
recently  because of low losses in most categories  management has assigned minimum percentages to each category 
for loans rated  an industry standard loss percentage of is used 
all significant loans rated and are individually analyzed and a specific reserve is assigned based on exposure or industry standards whichever is greater 
these accounts  their reserves  and action plans to resolve their criticisms are reviewed by the loan committee 
all other loans rated and are assigned loss percentages of and respectively 
all loans rated are assigned specific reserve of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses  and may require the company to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes and accordingly  we manage exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
we do not have any trading instruments nor do we classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
we do not engage in any hedging activities or enter into any derivative instruments with a higher degree of risk than mortgage backed securities that are commonly pass through securities 
finally  we have no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
as part of our asset liability management program  the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is referred to as gap management 
it is our policy to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon of 
to 
gap management alone is not enough to properly manage interest rate sensitivity  because interest rates do not respond at the same speed or at the same level to market rate changes 
for example  savings and money market rates are more stable than loans tied to a prime rate and thus respond with less volatility to a market rate change 
we use a simulation model to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market rates 
the model of rising  falling and stable interest rate scenarios allow management to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market rate swings 
the analysis of impact on net interest margins as well as market value of equity over a twelve month period is subjected to a basis point increase and decrease in rate 
the december model reflects an increase of in net interest income and a decrease in market value equity for a basis point increase in rates 
the same model shows a decrease in net interest income and a increase in market value equity for a basis point decrease in rates 
our policy is to allow no more than change in net interest income and no more than change in market value equity for these scenarios 
therefore  we are within our policy guidelines and are protected from any significant impact due to market rate changes
