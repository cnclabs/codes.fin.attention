although we intend to remain so qualified  there may be facts and circumstances beyond our control that may affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
failure to qualify as a reit may subject us to income tax liabilities  including federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
the additional income tax incurred may significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to shareholders and for debt service

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in note to the financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements  including the following revenue recognition revenue is recognized on the accrual basis of accounting 
our revenues consist primarily of rentals received from tenants  which are comprised of minimum rent base rentals  bonus rentals 
table of contents and reimbursements from tenants for their pro rata share of expenses such as common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and utilities 
the minimum rent for all hospital facilities is fixed over the initial term or renewal term of the respective leases 
minimum rent for other material leases is recognized using the straight line method under which contractual rent increases are recognized evenly over the lease term 
bonus rents are recognized based upon increases in each facility s net patient revenue in excess of stipulated amounts 
bonus rentals are determined and paid each quarter based upon a computation that compares the respective facility s current quarter s net revenue to the corresponding quarter in the base year 
tenant reimbursements are accrued as revenue in the same period the related expenses are incurred by us 
investments in limited liability companies llcs our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our controlled investments 
in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for investments in real estate ventures and emerging issues task force issue  investor s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights  we account for our investments in llcs which we do not control using the equity method of accounting 
these investments  which represent to non controlling ownership interests  are recorded initially at our cost and subsequently adjusted for our net equity in the net income  cash contributions and distributions of the investments 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
during december   the financial accounting standards board decided to defer to the first quarter of  the implementation date for interpretation no 
this deferral only applies to variable interest entities that existed prior to february  as the interpretation applied immediately to variable interest entities created or obtained after january  pursuant to our preliminary analysis of the provisions of interpretation no 
 beginning in the first quarter of  we will begin to consolidate the results of operations  assets  liabilities  third party debt that is non recourse to us and minority interest liability to reflect the portion of the llcs held by other third party members of three of our llc investments that meet the criteria of a variable interest entity of which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the annual revenue for these three llcs was approximately million and the combined total assets total approximately million as of december  on a combined basis  these three llcs have approximately million in third party debt that is non recourse to us 
there will be no impact on our net income as a result of consolidating these llcs 
rental income recorded at the llcs relating to leases in excess of one year in length  is recognized using the straight line method under which contractual rents are recognized evenly over the lease term regardless of when payments are due 
the amount of rental revenue resulting from straight line rent adjustments is dependent on many factors including the nature and amount of any rental concessions granted to new tenants  scheduled rent increases under existing leases  as well as the acquisitions and sales of properties that have existing in place leases with terms in excess of one year 
as a result  the straight line adjustments to rental revenue may vary from period to period 
federal income taxes no provision has been made for federal income tax purposes since we qualify as a real estate investment trust under sections to of the internal revenue code of  and intend to continue to remain so qualified 
as such  we are exempt from federal income taxes and we are required to distribute at least of our real estate investment taxable income to our shareholders 
we are subject to a federal excise tax computed on a calendar year basis 
the excise tax equals of the amount by which of our ordinary income plus of any capital gain income for the calendar year exceeds cash distributions during the calendar year  as defined 
no provision for excise tax has been reflected in the financial statements as no tax was due 

table of contents earnings and profits  which determine the taxability of dividends to shareholders  will differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal tax purposes in the cost basis of assets and in the estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation and the recording of provision for investment losses

table of contents we adopted sfas no 
effective january  the adoption of this standard resulted in a gain  stemming from the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges on derivatives of  during  a loss of  during and a gain of  during funds from operations ffo  is a widely recognized measure of reit performance 
although ffo is a non gaap financial measure  we believe that information regarding ffo is helpful to shareholders and potential investors 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition  or that interpret the nareit definition differently than we interpret the definition 
to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income  determined in accordance with gaap 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap 
in addition  ffo should not be used as i an indication of our financial performance determined in accordance with gaap  ii as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  iii as a measure of our liquidity  iv nor is ffo an indicator of funds available for our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders 
in june of  we issued million additional shares of beneficial interest at per share generating net proceeds of million 
these proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our million revolving credit facility thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing ffo from june  through december  ffo is calculated as follows s net income depreciation expense consolidated investments unconsolidated affiliates gain on sale of real property consolidated investments unconsolidated affiliates ffo effects of inflation although inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years  the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are rising supply costs which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases 
operators of our hospital facilities are experiencing the effects of the tight labor market  including a shortage of nurses which has caused and may continue to cause an increase  in excess of the inflation rate  in salaries  wages and benefits expense 
in addition  due to unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional and general liability insurance markets  the cost of commercial professional and general liability insurance coverage has risen significantly 
as a result  certain operators of our hospital facilities  including all of the facilities leased to subsidiaries of uhs  assumed a greater portion of the hospital professional and general liability risk 
we cannot predict the ability of the operators of our facilities to continue to cover future cost increases 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a continuation of these trends will not have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations of the operators of our facilities which may affect their ability to make lease payments to us 
most of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
our hospital leases require all building operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes and other costs  to be paid by the lessee 
in addition  certain of the hospital leases contain bonus rental provisions  which require the lessee to pay additional rent to us based on increases in the revenues of the facility over a base year amount 
in addition  
table of contents most of our medical office building leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  insurance and real estate taxes over a base year amount 
these provisions may reduce our exposure to increases in operating costs resulting from inflation 
to the extent that some leases do not contain such provisions  our future operating results may be adversely impacted by the effects of inflation 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to million during as compared to million in the million increase during  as compared to  resulted from i a favorable increase of million in gains realized from the sale of real estate assets by llcs in which we own non controlling ownership interests million of gains realized during as compared to million during  and  ii million of other net favorable increases due primarily to increased earnings during  as compared to  from the llcs in which we own various non controlling ownership interests 
contributing to the increased earnings from the llcs was increased rental income recorded at the llcs relating to leases in excess of one year in length which is recognized using the straight line method 
also contributing to the increase was increased cash generated from the llcs in which we initially invested during or net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million during as compared to million during resulting primarily from i a favorable million gain realized during on the sale of real estate assets by a llc in which we own a non controlling ownership interest  ii a favorable million reduction in interest expense resulting primarily from the repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement using the proceeds generated from the issuance of million newly issued shares of beneficial interest in june   and  iii  of other net favorable changes including a  increase in bonus rental revenues
