item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion is based upon the company s consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and percentages in the discussion are rounded to the closest full percentage point and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
we design  develop  market and support identity authentication products that reduce the risk of loss from unauthorized transactions by validating a person s identity using a one time password and obtaining a legally enforceable digital signature  if needed  for financial transactions 
our products are used currently in a wide variety of applications including  but not limited to  internet banking  internet brokerage  e commerce applications dealing with web or mobile access and various corporate network access applications 
as evidenced by our current customer base  our products are purchased by companies and  depending on the business application  are distributed to either its employees or its customers 
those customers may be other businesses or as an example in the case of internet banking  the banks retail customers 
our target market is any business process that uses some form of electronic interface where the owner of that process is at risk if unauthorized users can gain access to its process and either obtain proprietary information or execute transactions that are not authorized 
our products can not only increase the security associated with accessing the business process  thereby reducing the losses from unauthorized access  but also  in many cases  can reduce the cost of the process itself by automating activities that were previously performed manually 
industry growth we believe that  while there are no accurate measurements of the total industry s size  the industry growth rate is increasing and will continue to grow at a significant rate into the foreseeable future 
growth is being driven by new government regulations  growing awareness of the impact of identity theft  and the growth in commerce that is transacted electronically 
the issues driving the growth are global issues and the rate of adoption in each country is a function of that country s culture  the competitive position of businesses operating in those countries  the country s overall economic conditions and the degree to which businesses and consumers within the country use technology 
examples of regulations that have been enacted in the us recently that support industry growth include the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and sarbanes oxley act of economic conditions the company s revenues may vary significantly with changes in the economic conditions in the countries in which it sells products currently 
with the company s current concentration of revenues in europe and specifically in the banking finance vertical market  significant changes in the economic outlook for the european banking market  may have a significant effect on the revenues of the company 
during difficult economic periods  our customers often delay the rollout of existing applications and defer purchase decisions related to the implementation of our product in new applications 
currency fluctuations 
in  approximately of the company s revenue and approximately of its operating expenses were generated incurred outside of the united states 
as a result  changes in currency  especially the euro to us dollar  can have a significant impact on revenue and expenses 
to minimize the net impact of currency the company attempts to denominate its billings in a currency such that it would provide a hedge against the operating expenses being incurred in that currency 
in addition  the company denominates the majority of our supply contracts in us dollars 
the euro strengthened approximately and the australian dollar strengthened approximately against the us dollar in both currencies strengthened approximately against the us dollar in the company estimates that the strengthening of the two currencies in compared to resulted in an increase in revenues of approximately  and an increase in operating expenses of approximately  the financial position and results of operations of the company s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency 
accordingly  assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
translation adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates are included as a separate component of stockholders equity deficit 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
foreign exchange transaction gains aggregating   and  are included in other non operating income expense for  and  respectively 
revenue revenues by geographic regions we sell the majority of our products in european countries with significant sales in the united states and other countries  primarily australia and asia pacific 
the breakdown of revenue in each of our major geographic areas was as follows year europe united states other countries total total revenue percent of total total revenues in increased  or over revenue generated in europe were  or higher than the increase was primarily attributable to increased volumes from existing customers of approximately  an increase from net new customers customers with revenues in that had no revenue in less customers with revenue in that had no revenue in of approximately  and the benefit from changes in the currency rate of approximately  the increase in revenues from other countries primarily reflects revenues from new customers in and benefits from currency of approximately  total revenues in decreased  or from the decline was due to weakness in demand in the european market  especially in the banking segment as noted in the table below 
we expect to increase our penetration of the us market by adding sales related staff and intend to actively pursue additional markets  particularly south america and the middle east in revenues by target market revenues are generated currently from two primary markets  banking finance banking and corporate network access cna through the use of both direct and indirect sales channels 
the breakdown of revenue between the two primary markets is as follows year banking cna total total revenue percent of total revenues from the banking market increased  or in over and revenues from the cna market increased  or in the same period 
the increase in revenues in both markets is attributable  in part  to the development of the indirect sales channel  which includes distributors  resellers  and solution partners 
the indirect sales channel supplements the company s direct sales force in the banking market and is the primary source of revenues in the cna market 
the company focused on developing the indirect sales channel in and it has resulted in significant increases in revenues in each of the years presented 
the decline in the banking segment in as compared to was attributable in part to a weak economy in the european banking market and the fact that a number of the company s major strategic banking customers had made significant purchases in since our product is used for specific applications  it is not uncommon for revenues from specific customers to vary significantly year to year as they go through the various phases of their marketing plans and deployments of digipass units to their customers 
the amounts shown above for cna currently include revenues generated in the e commerce market 
we expect that the e commerce market will be an important source of future revenue for the company as our products will not only provide a higher level of security for purchases made over the internet  they can also help protect our customers revenue stream by making it more difficult for subscribers to our customers internet services to share passwords 
gross profit and operating expenses the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and percentage of revenue year ended december  revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating costs sales and marketing research and development general and administrative non cash compensation recovery restructuring expenses total operating costs operating income loss interest income expense other income expense  net income loss from continuing operations provision for income taxes net income loss from continuing operations gross profit compared to consolidated gross profit for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  from the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in  as compared to in the increase in the gross profit as a percentage of revenue reflects the beneficial impact of currency and the increase in cna revenues as a percentage of total revenues  partially offset by a decline in the average sales price of the digipass units sold due to a change in mix of revenues within the banking market 
as previously noted  the company s purchases of inventory are denominated in us dollars 
also  as previously noted  the company denominates a portion of its sales in euros in order to offset the affects of currency on operating expenses 
as the euro and australian dollars strengthened during the year  revenues from sales made in euros and australian dollars increased  as measured in us dollars  without the corresponding increase in cost of goods sold 
the benefit from changes in currency rates as noted above was approximately  and represents an improvement in the gross profit rate of approximately percentage points 
consolidated gross profits  as a percentage of revenue  benefited in as revenues from the cna market increased from to of total revenue 
gross profits as a percentage of revenue on sales made to the banking and cna markets were approximately and  respectively  in the difference in the margin percentages between the two markets reflects the fact that orders from banking market are substantially larger than orders from the cna market and that the company provides volume purchase discounts 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue was adversely impacted by the change in mix of sales within the banking segment 
while the company did not change its standard pricing in  the mix of sales within the markets impacted the gross profit percentage 
in  the company received more orders from its larger strategic banking customers  which have a lower average selling price  reflecting the larger order size 
as a result  the margin within the banking segment in was lower than in compared to consolidated gross profit for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or  from the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in  as compared to in this increase in the gross profit as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects the increase in cna revenues as a percentage of total revenue and the change in mix of revenue within the banking market 
in  sales to the cna market increased from to of total revenue 
also  revenues from our larger strategic banking customers  which have lower gross profit percentages as a result of their larger order quantities  declined significantly in from sales and marketing expenses compared to consolidated sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  from this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in compensation related expenses  a reduction in advertising and printed marketing materials  and a reduction in travel 
the average full time sales and marketing employee headcount declined to in from in the reduction in sales and marketing was partially offset by the increased strength of the euro 
compared to consolidated sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  from this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in average full time sales and marketing employee headcount to in from in and their related expenses 
research and development expenses compared to consolidated research and development costs for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  as compared to the year ended december  the reduction reflects lower fees paid to third parties and lower compensation partially offset by the strengthening of the euro and australian dollar 
average full time research and development employee headcount in was compared to in compared to consolidated research and development costs for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  as compared to the year ended december  average full time research and development employee headcount in was compared to in general and administrative expenses compared to consolidated general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  from this decrease can be principally attributed to lower headcount  reduced spending on professional services  the collection of cash on accounts upon which a reserve had been established in prior years  a reduction in depreciation and amortization expenses  a reduction in travel expenses and a reduction in office related expenses such as rent and telephone 
average full time general and administrative employee headcount in was compared to in the reduction in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by legal expenses associated with the activcard litigation  which was settled in the fourth quarter of  and the impact of the strengthening of the euro 
compared to consolidated general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  from this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in headcount  reduced spending on professional services  and a reduction of amortization expenses resulting from the write off of assets as part of the restructuring in the fourth quarter of average full time general and administrative employee headcount in was compared to in because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed  a small variation in the timing of recognition of revenue could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
restructuring expenses there were no restructuring expenses for the year ended december  as compared with  in the expense in reflects changes in estimates of the reserves established in the fourth quarter of and primarily relate to the shutdown of the french operation and excess office space in the united states 
restructuring expenses for the year ended december  were  reflecting the costs of a reduction in staff of employees and the write off of intangible assets and property and equipment that were deemed not to be part of the core operations 
interest income expense  net consolidated net interest income expense was an expense of  in compared to expense of  in this decrease in expense was primarily due to an increase in average net cash balances  up from an average of  in to  in the company s term debt of  and accrued interest was repaid in full in the third quarter of the term debt had an annual interest rate of 
the company invested its cash balances in short term money market instruments at nominal rates of interest 
consolidated net interest income expense was an expense of  in compared to income of  in this increase in expense was primarily due to a reduction in average invested cash balances  down from an average of  in to  in and the reversal in of an expense accrual recorded in for the restructuring of the company s long term debt 
as part of the debt restructuring the interest rate on the term debt increased from to  effective august   on a million term loan  due september  other income expense other income expense primarily includes exchange gains losses on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency 
the increase in other income of  in over primarily reflects an increase in exchange gains of  during that period 
other income expense decreased  in from foreign exchange transaction gains declined  during that period 
income taxes income tax expense for was  and compares to expense of  in the expense relates primarily to the belgian operating subsidiary  whose tax loss carryforwards were fully utilized in the company reported an income tax benefit in of  at december   the company has united states net operating loss carryforwards approximating  and foreign net operating loss carryforwards approximating  such losses are available to offset future taxable income in the respective jurisdictions and expire in varying amounts beginning in and continuing through in addition  if certain substantial changes in the company s ownership are deemed to have occurred  there would be an annual limitation on the amount of the us carryforwards that could be utilized 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash balances totaling  and no outstanding term debt 
cash generated from operating activities was  during the year ended december  during  we generated  from investing activities and used  in financing activities consisting of a capital raise  debt payments and the repurchase of the company s series c convertible preferred stock 
net capital expenditures  assets purchased less assets sold  generated  for the year ended december  in  we entered into a convertible loan agreement with artesia bank nv  formerly banque paribas belgique nv and now doing business as dexia bank dexia  in order to refinance the  payment due december  in connection with our acquisition of digipass 
the terms of the agreement provided that the  principal amount was convertible  upon an offering  into shares of our common stock 
the original interest was at the rate of  payable annually  and the original maturity date was on september  on august   the terms of this loan were restructured 
under the revised terms  the loan was convertible into shares of our common stock at the fixed conversion rate of per share  rather than a floating rate based on the market price of our common stock  and the interest rate increased from to annually 
the loan and accrued interest was repaid in full in september in july  the company issued  shares of series c convertible preferred stock the series c preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for cash of  to ubizen nv ubizen 
the preferred stock was convertible into  shares of common stock at any time through july if not converted by july  the preferred stock would have been  at the option of the company  either repurchased or converted into common stock at a rate equal to the average market price of the common stock for consecutive business days on which the common stock was traded prior to the conversion date less five percent 
in july  the company reached an agreement with ubizen whereby it purchased and redeemed all of the series c convertible preferred stock and common stock purchase warrants owned by ubizen in exchange for  in cash and  shares of common stock 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  the company paid  to ubizen and issued  shares of common stock on july  an additional  was paid to ubizen in november using the closing price of the common stock on july   the value of the stock issued was  the common stock issued by the company is subject to a lock up period wherein the lock up expired or will expire in increments of  shares each on october   january   april  and july  once the lock up expires  the shares will be subject to volume trading restrictions through january  on september   the company sold shares  with a stated valued of  per share  of its series d cumulative convertible voting preferred stock the series d preferred stock and  warrants to purchase common stock 
the series d preferred stock carries a dividend  is convertible into million shares of common stock at a fixed price of per share and will vote with the common stock as a class on matters presented to the stockholders 
the net proceeds from the sale totaled  of which  was allocated to the series d preferred stock and  was allocated to the warrants based upon their relative fair values 
in addition  a beneficial conversion value was calculated for the series d preferred stock as the difference between the price of the common stock at the transaction date and the conversion price of the series d preferred stock 
the amount of the beneficial conversion   is analogous to a dividend and was recorded to accumulated deficit 
the company maintains an overdraft agreement with fortis banque bank of belgium 
under terms of the agreement  the company can borrow an amount equal to of its belgium subsidiary s defined accounts receivable up to maximum of two million euros 
borrowings under the overdraft agreement accrue interest at an annual rate of and the company is obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 
as of december   approximately  euros were available under the overdraft agreement and there were no borrowings outstanding under the agreement 
the assets  excluding inventory  of the belgian subsidiary secure the agreement and while it has no specific termination date  it can be terminated with thirty days notice 
the agreement is governed by the general lending conditions for corporate customers  registered in brussels  belgium on december  the net effect of activity resulted in an increase in cash of  and a cash balance of  at december   compared to  at the end of our working capital at december  was  an increase of  from a deficit of  at december  the change is attributable to the generation of a positive cash flow from operations in and the proceeds of the financing partially offset by the purchase of the company s series c convertible preferred stock and the repayment of the loan from dexia 
our current ratio was to at december  we believe that our current cash balances  credit available under our existing overdraft agreement and the anticipated cash generated from operations  including the realization of deferred revenue recorded as a current liability and deposits received on orders of digipass to be delivered in  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future 
the net effect of activity resulted in a decrease in cash of  and a cash balance of  at december   compared to  at the end of our working capital at december  was a deficit  a decrease of  from working capital total of  at december  the decrease in cash was primarily attributable to the generation of a loss from operations in  the repayment of the debt and the impact of exchange rates on cash 
the decline in the current ratio was primarily attributable to the decline in cash and the reclassification of our term loan of  from dexia  which was due september   from long term debt to current maturities of long term debt 
there is risk  however  that our revenue and cash receipts will not be sufficient to meet the operating needs of the business 
if this is the case  we will need to significantly reduce our workforce  sell certain of our assets  enter into strategic relationships or business combinations  discontinue some or all of our operations  or take other similar restructuring actions 
while we expect that these actions would result in a reduction of recurring costs  they also may result in a reduction of recurring revenues and cash receipts 
it is also likely that we would incur substantial non recurring costs to implement one or more of these restructuring actions 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the company has the following contractual obligations  which are primarily office and car leases payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations      purchase obligations   other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total contractual obligations      critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  net realizable value of inventory  investments in secured services  inc and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for goods and services 
we analyze accounts receivable  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
net realizable value of inventory we maintain reserves for inventory where it appears that the carrying cost of the inventory may not be recovered through subsequent sale of the inventory 
we analyze the quantity of inventory on hand  the quantity sold in the past year  the anticipated sales volume in the form of sales to new customers as well as sales to previous customers  the expected sales price and the cost of making the sale when evaluating the valuation of our inventory 
if the sales volume or sales price of a specific model declines significantly  additional reserves may be required 
valuation of investment in secured services  inc 
the initial value of consideration received from secured services  inc ssi  in exchange for the assets of the vacman enterprise business unit  was established by an independent valuation firm 
on an ongoing basis  we review information made available by ssi through its filings with the securities and exchange commission and its press releases and consider it within the context of the assumptions made by the independent valuation firm 
we also monitor ssi s compliance with the terms of the specific investment instruments to which they relate 
considering the start up nature of ssi  the highly competitive environment in which they operate and the uncertainty associated with ssi s access to additional capital  it may be that ssi s business prospects will deteriorate and  as a result  require the company to reduce the value of its investment in ssi 
the investment in ssi as of december  was  while ssi had remained current on payments related to the notes receivable through december   the full amount of the investment is at risk if ssi is unsuccessful in executing their business plan 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  and software development costs we assess the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company assesses the recoverability of its purchased software against estimated future revenue for the individual products over the estimated remaining economic life of the software 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
given the highly competitive environment and frequency of technological changes in our industry  it is reasonably possible that estimates of anticipated future revenue  the remaining economic life of the company s software products  or both may be reduced significantly 
the total amount of goodwill and other intangible assets as of december  was  and the full amount is at risk of impairment 
see footnote to the financial statements for more detailed information 
research and development we are devoting substantial capital and other resources to enhance our existing security products and develop new products to provide identity authentication security solutions on different platforms and for different applications 
costs of research and development  principally the design and development of hardware and software prior to the determination of technological feasibility  are expensed as incurred on a project by project basis 
our software capitalization policy currently defines technological feasibility as a functioning beta test prototype with confirmed manufacturability a working model  within a reasonably predictable range of costs 
additional criteria include receptive customers  or potential customers  as evidenced by interest expressed in a beta test prototype  at some suggested selling price

the company has not issued any financial instruments with these characteristics and sfas no 
has had no affect on its financial statements 
certain factors there are a number of other factors that could affect future results 
you should carefully consider the following factors as well as other information contained in this annual report 
if any of the following items were to occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we had a history of operating losses and have a large accumulated deficit 
although we have reported net income of  for the year ended december   we have incurred net losses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as of december   our accumulated deficit is  we face significant competition and if we lose or fail to gain market share our financial results will suffer 
the market for computer and network security products is highly competitive 
our competitors include organizations that provide computer and network security products based upon approaches similar to and different from those that we employ such as rsa security  activcard  rainbow technologies  and aladdin knowledge systems 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other competitive resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
technological changes occur rapidly in our industry and our development of new products is critical to maintain our revenues 
the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
our future revenue growth and operating profit will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our current products and develop innovative products to distinguish ourselves from the competition and to meet customers changing needs in the data security industry 
we cannot assure you that security related product developments and technology innovations by others will not adversely affect our competitive position or that we will be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology  industry standards or customer requirements on a timely basis 
the sales cycle for our products and technology is long  and we may incur substantial expenses for sales that do not occur when anticipated 
the sales cycle for our products  which is the period of time between the identification of a potential customer and completion of the sale  is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little control 
if revenue falls significantly below anticipated levels  our business would be seriously harmed 
a typical sales cycle in the banking market is often three to six months and with larger banking transactions up to eighteen months 
purchasing decisions for our products and systems may be subject to delay due to many factors that are not within our control  such as the time required for a prospective customer to recognize the need for our products  the significant expense of many data security products and network systems  customers internal budgeting processes  and internal procedures customers may require for the approval of large purchases 
we have a significant dependence on major customers and losing any of these customers could result in a significant loss in revenues if we don t find other customers who generate significant future revenues  the unforeseen loss of one or more of our major customers  or the inability to maintain reasonable profit margins on sales to any of these customers  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends on establishing and maintaining strategic relationships with other companies to develop  market and distribute our technology and products and  in some cases  to incorporate our technology into their products 
part of our business strategy is to enter into strategic alliances and other cooperative arrangements with other companies in our industry 
we currently are involved in cooperative efforts with respect to incorporation of our products into products of others  research and development efforts  marketing efforts and reseller arrangements 
none of these relationships are exclusive  and some of our strategic partners also have cooperative relationships with certain of our competitors 
if we are unable to enter cooperative arrangements in the future or if we lose any of our current strategic or cooperative relationships  our business could be harmed 
we do not control the time and resources devoted to such activities by parties with whom we have relationships 
in addition  we may not have the resources available to satisfy our commitments  which may adversely affect these relationships 
these relationships may not continue  may not be commercially successful  or may require our expenditure of significant financial  personnel and administrative resources from time to time 
further  certain of our products and services compete with the products and services of our strategic partners 
we may need additional capital in the future and our failure to obtain capital would interfere with our growth strategy 
our ability to obtain financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
they may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments  defer our product development activities  or delay the introduction of new products 
we must continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel for our research and development department 
the market for highly skilled technicians in europe  asia  australia and the united states is highly competitive 
if we fail to attract  train  assimilate and retain qualified technical personnel for our research and development department  we will experience delays in introductions of new or modified products  loss of clients and market share and a reduction in revenues 
we face a number of risks associated with our international operations  any or all of which could result in a disruption in our business and a decrease in our revenues 
our business internationally is subject to a number of risks any or all of which could result in a disruption in our business and a decrease in our revenues 
these include inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  wage and price controls  uncertain protection for intellectual property rights  imposition of trade barriers  differing technology standards  uncertain demand for electronic commerce  linguistic and cultural differences  political instability  and social unrest 
we are subject to foreign exchange risks  and improper management of that risk could result in large cash losses 
because a significant number of our principal customers are located outside the united states  we expect that international sales will continue to generate a significant portion of our total revenue 
we are subject to foreign exchange risks because the majority of our costs are denominated in us dollars  whereas a significant portion of the sales and expenses of our european operating subsidiaries are denominated in various foreign currencies 
a decrease in the value of any of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could affect the profitability in us dollars of our products sold in these markets 
we do not currently hold forward exchange contracts or other hedging instruments to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars to offset currency rate fluctuations 
we have a great dependence on a limited number of suppliers and the loss of their manufacturing capability could materially impact our operations 
in the event that the supply of components or finished products is interrupted or relations with either of our principal vendors is terminated  there could be a considerable delay in finding suitable replacement sources to manufacture our products at the same cost or at all 
the majority of our products are manufactured by three independent vendors  one headquartered in europe and the other two in hong kong 
our security tokens are assembled at facilities in mainland china 
the importation of these products from china exposes us to the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the policies of the chinese government  political unrest or unstable economic conditions in china or developments in the united states that are adverse to trade  including enactment of protectionist legislation 
we depend significantly upon our proprietary technology and intellectual property and the failure to protect our proprietary rights could require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could reduce revenue and increase our operating costs 
we currently rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection  and generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and with key vendors and suppliers 
there has been substantial litigation in the technology industry regarding intellectual property rights  and we may have to litigate to protect our proprietary technology 
we expect that companies in the computer and information security market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors increases 
any such claims or litigation may be time consuming and costly  cause product shipment delays  require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could reduce revenue and increase our operating costs 
our patents may not provide us with competitive advantages 
we hold several patents in the united states and a corresponding patent in some european countries  which cover multiple aspects of our technology 
the us patents expire between and and the patent in those european countries expires in there can be no assurance that we will continue to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or that patents of others will not hinder our competitive advantage 
we are subject to product liability risks 
a malfunction of or design defect in our products which results in a breach of a customer s data security could result in tort or warranty claims against us 
we do not presently maintain product liability insurance for these types of claims 
there is significant government regulation of technology exports and to the extent we cannot meet the requirements of the regulations we may be prohibited from exporting some of our products  which could negatively impact our revenues 
our international sales and operations are subject to risks such as the imposition of government controls  new or changed export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  trade restrictions and changes in tariffs 
if we become unable to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis our business in those countries would no longer exist and our revenues would decrease dramatically 
certain of our products are subject to export controls under us law 
the list of products and countries for which export approval is required  and the regulatory policies with respect thereto may be revised from time to time and our inability to obtain required approvals under these regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to make international sales 
we employ cryptographic technology in our authentication products that uses complex mathematical formulations to establish network security systems 
many of our products are based on cryptographic technology 
with cryptographic technology  a user is given a key that is required to encrypt and decode messages 
the security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user s key and in part on the application of algorithms  which are advanced mathematical factoring equations 
these codes may eventually be broken or become subject to government regulation regarding their use  which would render our technology and products less effective 
the occurrence of any one of the following could result in a decline in demand for our technology and products any significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems  including the development of an easy factoring method or faster  more powerful computers  publicity of the successful decoding of cryptographic messages or the misappropriation of keys  and increased government regulation limiting the use  scope or strength of cryptography 
any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
we may make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
should we do so  our failure to successfully manage future acquisitions could seriously harm our operating results 
in the event of any future purchases  we will face additional financial and operational risks  including difficulty in assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of acquired companies  disruption in our business because of the allocation of resources to consummate these transactions and the diversion of management s attention from our existing business  difficulty in retaining key technical and managerial personnel from acquired companies  dilution of our stockholders  if we issue equity to fund these transactions  assumption of operating losses  increased expenses and liabilities  and our relationships with existing employees  customers and business partners may be weakened or terminated as a result of these transactions 
we experience variations in quarterly operating results and are subject to seasonality  both of which may result in a volatile stock price 
in the future  as in the past  our quarterly operating results may vary significantly resulting in a volatile stock price 
factors affecting our operating results include the level of competition  the size  timing  cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders  new product announcements or introductions by current competitors  technological changes in the market for data security products including the adoption of new technologies and standards  changes in pricing by current competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and product enhancements on a timely basis  if at all  component costs and availability  our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs  market acceptance of new products and product enhancements  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and general economic trends 
we also experience seasonality in all markets 
these seasonal trends are most notable in the summer months  particularly in europe  when many businesses defer purchase decisions 
a small group of persons control a substantial amount of our common stock and could delay or prevent a change of control 
our board of directors  our officers and their immediate families and related entities beneficially own approximately  with mr 
t 
kendall hunt controlling approximately  of the outstanding shares of our common stock not including the shares that are issuable a upon conversion of our series d preferred stock  b upon exercise of warrants purchased in conjunction with the series d preferred stock or c as dividends upon the series d preferred stock 
if the foregoing categories of shares are included as outstanding shares  the beneficial ownership percentages are and  respectively 
as the chairman of the board of directors and our largest stockholder  mr 
hunt may exercise substantial control over our future direction and operation and such concentration of control may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control and may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
our stock price may be volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above acceptable prices 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in market valuations of other technology companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations  contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  future sales of common stock  any deviations in net revenues or in losses from levels expected by the investment community  and trading volume fluctuations 
certain provisions of our charter and of delaware law make a takeover of our company more difficult 
our corporate charter and delaware law contain provisions  such as a class of authorized but unissued preferred stock which may be issued by our board without stockholder approval  that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company 
delaware law also limits business combinations with interested stockholders 
these provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change in our control or a change in our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests  and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
the existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
future issuances of blank check preferred stock may reduce voting power of common stock and may have anti takeover effects that could prevent a change in control 
our corporate charter authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock with such designations  rights  powers and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors  including such dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights  powers and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the board of directors without further stockholder approval 
the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock 
in addition  the authorized shares of preferred stock and common stock could be utilized  under certain circumstances  as a method of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control 
us investors may have difficulties in making claims for any breach of their rights as holders of shares because some of our assets and executives are not located in the united states 
several of our executives are residents of belgium  and a substantial portion of our assets and those of some of our executives are located in belgium 
as a result  it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on those persons located in belgium  or to enforce judgments against some of our executives based upon the securities or other laws of jurisdictions other than belgium 
moreover  we believe that under belgian law there exist certain restrictions on the enforceability in belgium in original actions  or in actions of enforcement of judgments rendered against us in courts outside jurisdictions that are a party to the brussels convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as amended 
actions for enforcement of such judgments may be successful only if the belgian court confirms the substantive correctness of the judgment of such court  and is satisfied that the judgment is not contrary to the principles of public policy in belgium or rules of belgian public law  that the judgment did not violate the rights of the defendant  that the judgment is final under applicable law  that the court did not accept its jurisdiction solely on the basis of the nationality of the plaintiff  and as to the authenticity of the text of the judgment submitted to it 
judgments rendered in the courts of parties to the brussels convention will be enforceable by the courts of belgium without reexamination of the merits of the case provided such judgment is final and otherwise satisfies all of the conditions provided for in this convention 
if proceedings have been brought in one country  however  new proceedings in another country may be barred 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk in  approximately of our business was conducted outside the united states in europe and asia pacific 
a significant portion of our business operations is transacted in foreign currencies 
as a result  we have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
we are affected by both foreign currency translation and transaction adjustments 
translation adjustments result from the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries balance sheets and income statements to us dollars at year end exchange rates and weighted average exchange rates  respectively 
translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded directly into stockholders equity 
transaction adjustments result from currency exchange movements when a foreign subsidiary transacts business in a currency that differs from its local currency 
these adjustments are recorded as gains or losses in our statements of operations 
our foreign subsidiaries business transactions are spread across approximately different countries and currencies 
this geographic diversity reduces the risk to our operating results 
interest rate risk we have minimal interest rate risk 
we have no outstanding debt and our cash is invested in short term instruments at current market rates 
if rates were to increase or decrease by one percentage point  the company s interest income would increase or decrease approximately  annually 
impairment risk at december   we had goodwill and other intangible assets of  related mostly to technology purchased in as part of our acquisition of identikey 
we will assess the net realizable value of the intangible assets on a regular basis  but at least annually  to determine if we have incurred any declines in the value of our capital investment 
while we did not experience impairment during the year ended december   we may incur impairment charges in future periods
