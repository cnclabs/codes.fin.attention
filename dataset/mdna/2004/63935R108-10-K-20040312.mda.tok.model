development of business in the late s  edward s 
adams  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  started a company in denver  colorado  focused on managing corporate travel 
in  mr 
adams formed professional travel corporation by merging his company with three of the largest corporate travel management companies in colorado 
by  professional travel corporation had become one of the largest travel management companies in the united states 
in  us office products purchased professional travel corporation  and mr 
adams became president of us office products corporate travel services division 
he was charged with building a national corporate travel management company focused on middle market clients 
under us office products ownership  the management team led by mr 
adams acquired an additional eleven regional corporate travel management companies and significantly increased the geographical scale and client base of the business 
in june  us office products distributed  shares of our common stock to the stockholders of us office products  or the travel distribution 
additionally  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock simultaneously with the travel distribution 
the travel distribution was part of a restructuring plan in which us office products spun off its print management  technology solutions  educational supplies and corporate travel services businesses 
following the travel distribution  we continued to acquire regional corporate travel management companies 
from through  we acquired approximately regional travel management companies  including satotravel and an incentive and meeting company 
in  we acquired seven additional travel management companies along with a company specializing in the delivery of travel services over the internet 
as of march  we had the following significant subsidiaries name headquarters aqua software products  inc santa ana  california cornerstone enterprises  inc  d b a navigant performance group marlboro  massachusetts international travel consultants  d b a navigant international belgium brussels  belgium kr agencia de viagens ltda  d b a navigant international brazil rio de janeiro  brazil marine oilfield travel logistics  lp houston  texas navigant international canada  inc toronto  ontario navigant international north central  inc chicago  illinois navigant international northeast  inc stamford  connecticut navigant international northwest  inc seattle  washington navigant international rocky mountain  inc denver  colorado navigant international south central  lp houston  texas navigant international southeast  inc raleigh  north carolina navigant international southwest  llc santa ana  california navigant international united kingdom ltd 
london  england scheduled airlines traffic offices  inc  d b a satotravel  a navigant international company sterling  virginia transcap voyages sa  d b a navigant international france paris  france travel services industry we believe the travel services industry can be divided into two sectors the unmanaged leisure and small business sector and the corporate travel management sector 
we compete in the corporate travel management sector  which we believe is made up of approximately travel management companies 
according to the travel industry association of america  americans spent a total of billion on domestic travel in  of which we believe a significant portion was for business travel 
the corporate travel management industry grew dramatically as a result of the deregulation of the airline industry in the complex pricing strategies adopted by the airlines to maximize their yields and loads created an opportunity for travel management companies to assist mid sized and large companies in managing their travel expenses 
over the years  the industry has progressed from merely delivering low cost airline tickets to providing end to end support and services 
travel generally is among the largest controllable expense for most companies 
businesses hire corporate travel management companies to reduce these expenses  and to manage the travel process 
corporate travel management companies can cut travel expenses for their clients in many ways  including creating travel policies to take advantage of savings opportunities inherent in complex airline pricing structures  collecting data for greater leverage with suppliers  negotiating favorable pricing directly with travel suppliers for the benefit of a particular client and passing on cost savings and price reductions negotiated for the benefit of all clients 
the corporate travel management industry has changed significantly since some of the major changes are conversion to management contracts and service fee arrangements  reduction in and elimination of commissions from airlines  increasing industry reliance on technology  and expansion of services offered to clients 
we believe that a successful response to these changes requires significant technological and financial resources  and that larger corporate travel management companies therefore may have a competitive advantage 
accordingly  we believe the corporate travel management industry is undergoing a period of consolidation and that significant growth opportunity exists 
we believe that large companies providing integrated systems from purchasing to data collection  offering their services through both traditional and online means  will eventually be more successful 
the industry s role and capacity as a distribution channel  and its relationship with both clients and suppliers  is also undergoing significant change as a result of the internet and other technological innovations 
we believe these innovations offer opportunities for corporate travel management companies to increase the efficiency of their distribution capacities and enhance services provided to travelers and management 
the industry has been undergoing numerous challenges since the september  terrorist attacks  including the decline in travel from the levels that existed prior to those attacks  the decline of the us economy  continued geopolitical instability  and world health concerns 
these challenges  in part  led to bankruptcy filings by major airlines  including united airlines and us air 
although us air emerged from bankruptcy protection  many factors could cause other airlines to experience adverse economic pressure  which could lead to other carriers seeking bankruptcy protection as well 
business strategy our mission is to provide corporate travel management services delivered globally by our unified team of responsive professionals who are committed to exceeding the expectations of shareholders  clients and fellow associates we refer to our employees as associates 
the principal elements of our business strategy are to generate internal growth through local marketing focused on increasing our middle market client base 
we intend to expand our client base of middle market companies by capitalizing on the breadth of our services  size  geographic scope and financial resources while maintaining our local and regional relationships and service 
we believe that our global presence will attract middle market corporate clients that have locations in more than one geographic region 
increasing our military and government client base 
the acquisition of satotravel increased our ability to compete for us military and government clients 
in the years that satotravel has served the travel needs of us military and government clients it has gained a strong understanding of the intricacies of military and government travel standards and protocol 
satotravel has developed customized programs  technology and services to fit the unique needs of military and government travelers 
we believe that we can use this expertise to compete effectively for additional similar business 
expanding our client base to large scale corporate clients 
through satotravel and navigant integrated services  we believe we have the ability to service and compete for large scale corporate clients 
navigant integrated services operates state of the art call centers  which provide clients with premium service  flexibility and cost saving opportunities 
continuing our cross selling efforts 
we will continue to market our incentive  meeting and special event travel services to corporate clients  sell corporate travel management services to current incentive and group clients and market leisure travel to our clients employees 
use the internet to attract new clients and increase efficiency 
the internet provides a multifaceted opportunity for us  which can be exploited both in our existing corporate business and in our growing leisure travel operations 
on the corporate side  the internet can be used to attract new clients and to serve existing clients more efficiently 
by serving our clients electronically  whether over the internet or through corporate intranets  we can reduce transaction costs 
in addition  both the internet and client intranets allow us to more effectively market leisure travel service to employees of our existing corporate clients and to reach substantial new markets for leisure travel through private label and co branding initiatives 
leverage our size to decrease costs and increase revenues 
as the second largest corporate travel management company in the united states based on airline tickets sold  we believe we can negotiate favorable contracts with vendors and travel suppliers  including incentive override contracts 
these contracts include agreements with selected global distribution system vendors  hotel commission clearinghouses  rental car companies  hotel property management companies and airlines 
some of these agreements provide payments to us of up front incentives  as well as annual payments or cost savings that we believe are significantly higher than amounts that would have been offered to any of our individual subsidiary companies 
in addition  we believe that we can benefit from greater purchasing power in such key expense areas as telecommunications  advertising  insurance  overnight delivery  employee benefits  office supplies and printing 
we believe that we continue to achieve economies of scale through the integration of our back office operations  technology development and information and management systems at our current operations  while freeing local management to focus on growth and customer service 
in addition  we continue to consolidate regional locations and eliminate unnecessary facilities 
continue to acquire established  profitable and well managed corporate travel management companies 
we continue to believe that the corporate travel management industry is highly fragmented with significant opportunities to consolidate through selective acquisitions of leading regional and local companies 
we will seek to acquire companies that have demonstrated growth and profitability  have desirable geographical locations  are run by successful  experienced entrepreneurs whom we will endeavor to retain  predominantly serve the corporate market and emphasize customer service 
we routinely review and conduct investigations of potential acquisitions of domestic and foreign travel management companies 
when we believe a favorable opportunity exists  we seek to enter into discussions with the owners of such businesses regarding the possibility of an acquisition by us 
at any given time  we may be in discussion with one or more corporate travel management company owners 
we may also make other strategic investments in and acquisitions of other travel related businesses 
services travel management services we provide our clients with a wide range of travel management services in addition to reservation and ticketing  including developing corporate travel policies  managing adherence to travel policies  outsourcing travel management consulting services  designing information and management reporting systems  negotiating favorable pricing with travel suppliers  and planning and organizing incentive programs  corporate meetings and special events 
we book travel reservations for our clients with a variety of travel suppliers  including airlines  hotels and rental car companies  using three major global distribution systems sabre  galileo apollo and worldspan 
we have long term agreements with each of these companies 
after making travel reservations for our clients  we issue tickets  both paper and electronic  and provide our customers with detailed itineraries  which include confirmation numbers for airline  hotel and car rental reservations 
we can assist our clients in developing travel policies that enable the client to manage its travel expenses 
these policies can mandate the use of particular vendors  set parameters on the class of service used by travelers  require advance purchase of airline tickets and define the use of frequent flier program benefits 
these policies may also have risk management features  such as limiting the number of officers and employees who may travel on the same flight 
our management reports provide detailed and comprehensive information about each client s travel expenses and patterns 
these reports show savings achieved through the use of preferred vendors and adherence to travel policies  and analyze destinations  airlines and hotel usage and rental car expense 
the information collected assists us and the client in negotiating discounts and pricing with vendors  and allows the client to monitor and enforce its travel policies 
we operate a hour toll free telephone service to provide emergency assistance to travelers 
many other travel management companies use this service and we believe it is one of the best hour services in the travel industry 
we have a meetings and incentive subsidiary doing business as navigant performance group  or npg 
npg operates out of regional offices throughout the united states  canada and the united kingdom and provides innovation and expertise in the areas of incentive programs  meetings and special events 
services provided by npg include  but are not limited to  strategic planning  promotion support  site selection  contract negotiations  program planning  registration  creative support and on site management 
in  we formed navigant integrated services  or nis to serve our large scale corporate accounts 
through state of the art call centers  nis delivers cutting edge technology  providing our clients with premium service  flexibility and cost saving opportunities 
in addition to corporate travel management  we provide leisure travel services to both individuals and groups as a small portion of our overall business 
we derive part of our leisure travel business through our existing corporate client base 
use of technology we embrace technology as a key to future success in the corporate travel management industry 
our information technology can provide our clients corporate travel managers  as well as financial officers  with extensive data about individual  departmental and company travel activity and patterns 
we can use this information to consult with our corporate clients regarding the structure  operation and efficiency of a variety of corporate travel policies 
in addition  we can provide corporate clients with comprehensive information about cost saving opportunities for the travel undertaken by their employees 
our wholly owned subsidiary  aqua software products  inc  has developed a fully automated quality assurance program  aquaplatinum tm  which features both a quality auditing system and a computerized cost avoidance system 
we have branded our version of this product aqua 
aqua s trip auditor module checks each travel record for accuracy and completeness and repetitively searches airline seat maps for each traveler s preferred seat assignments  hotel rate comparisons and frequent flier upgrade opportunities 
aqua s farebuster module is a computerized cost avoidance program which checks each record for a lower airline fare and continuously checks wait list flights and flight inventories for discount fares that become available prior to travel 
aqua also advises travel managers of travelers who are not taking advantage of the lowest fare 
aquaquest is a product in development for aqua s customers  which is planned to offer travel agents access to orbitz web based search engine and its inventory of low fare ticket prices from numerous airlines 
currently  we have the aqua system installed to process approximately of our transactions  and plan to continue conversions of newly acquired companies during three of the top five travel management companies in the united states license portions of the aqua system 
in  we embarked upon a standardized program to consolidate our accounting and client reporting systems 
this resulted in converting accounting systems to a single system and reporting systems to a standard system 
with the exception of satotravel and acquisitions made in the last six months  of our north america transactions are now processed on our consolidated system 
we continue to evaluate the consolidation of satotravel s system and expect to consolidate their transactions when it is appropriate to do so 
we believe that the internet has the potential to allow us to provide an even higher level of service to our corporate clients while significantly reducing distribution costs  especially labor costs 
we serve our corporate clients through our consolidated website  navigant 
com  and our suite of internet products and services  businessflyr  reportflyr  rescueflyr  alertflyr and webflyr 
businessflyr allows our corporate clients to book air  car and hotel travel online while enforcing corporate travel policy and capturing their travel spending patterns 
several different online booking systems can be configured based on the corporate client s requirements 
through reportflyr  the corporate client can view trip information sorted at every level of corporate organization  from individual travel to department  division or entire company 
reportflyr allows corporate travel managers and other executives the ability to view their company s travel activities and real time data hours a day using a password protected system 
we have introduced additional internet products  including rescueflyr  a product designed to help travelers salvage value from an unused  non refundable ticket  alertflyr  a tool to organize and monitor valuable travel data in a single  customizable view  and webflyr  a product to provide customers with access to the orbitz inventory of low fare ticket prices from numerous airlines 
in addition  we have developed an integrated online travel management solution  passportal  and plan to launch the initial version of this product in the second quarter of we have also been developing a web based application  netprofile  to provide customer creation and management of traveler profiles that are centrally managed  standardized  and easily accessible 
we are also expanding our efforts to cross sell leisure travel to employees of our corporate clients and members of affinity group clients through our benefitvacations corporate affiliate program and to provide reservation and ticketing  as well as our quality control and cost reduction services  to other leisure consumers 
this program will allow our customers and their employees access to discount pricing  exclusive inventory and added incentives for leisure travel 
distribution of services we provide corporate travel management services to our clients through several channels  including on site offices  regional travel management offices  call centers and on site satellite ticket printers  or stps 
as of march   we had approximately on site offices on client premises  where we provide customized trip planning and reservation and ticketing services to the employees of corporate and governmental clients 
on site operations are typically used by clients with airline expenditures in excess of million per year 
through an on site office  we are able to work one on one with the client s travel manager to meet the client s travel needs  including the need for customized travel information and negotiations with travel suppliers frequently used by the customer 
as of march   we had approximately regional and branch offices 
these offices are typically used by corporate customers with less than million in travel expenditures per year 
the regional offices provide local companies with comprehensive travel management services  including trip planning  reservation and ticketing services  accounting  corporate travel reporting  negotiations with frequently used travel suppliers and consulting 
the regional nature of these offices allows them to leverage their local market expertise and to provide quick  responsive and personalized service 
in addition  regional offices provide backup to nearby on site locations 
as of march   we operated five call centers  which serve our large scale corporate clients and several military and governmental customers 
call centers are typically used by corporate  military and government clients with more than million in travel expenditures per year 
the call centers provide clients with premium service  flexibility and cost saving opportunities 
as of march   we also operated approximately stps at client locations across the country 
we use these printers to distribute tickets instantly to clients whose field locations have enough volume to justify the stp 
locations with lower volume can receive tickets via overnight delivery services 
we believe that the growth of electronic ticketing will eventually eliminate the need for stps and overnight delivery  thus lowering distribution costs 
we have entered into arrangements with third parties pursuant to which we fulfill travel reservations placed on the internet 
in addition  through our navigant 
com website  we allow clients to  among other things  check flight times  make reservations  access and sort password protected corporate travel data  find restaurants and automatic teller machines and access the latest currency conversions 
we offer reservation services to our clients through the internet  e mail and facsimile 
these distribution methods offer clients the option of performing reservation services directly  while we provide a supporting role 
our role includes performing quality control on the reservation  assessing travel policy compliance  assisting the traveler with the use of the reservation system and issuing and delivering tickets reserved by the client 
additionally  we report to management on matters such as pre and post travel activity  cost saving opportunities and the development and assessment of the client s travel policy and negotiated rate opportunities 
marketing and sales our marketing continually targets both new and existing customers 
our sales staff identifies potential clients  and develops opportunities to provide additional travel services to existing clients 
over the past few years  travel policy and travel purchasing decisions in larger companies have been centralized in purchasing departments  with travel managers or within the offices of chief financial officers 
the selection of a travel agency has also become more formal  with larger accounts soliciting bids through requests for proposals 
we have adapted to these changes by relying on a sales force specially trained in the business of corporate travel  supported by experienced marketing staff 
we have approximately associates in our sales and marketing departments 
competition the corporate travel management industry is extremely competitive 
we compete primarily with other corporate travel management companies 
some of our competitors may have greater brand name recognition and financial resources than we do 
the largest corporate travel management company is significantly larger than us or our other competitors  and we compete with several companies which are similar in size to us 
competition within the corporate travel management industry is increasing as the industry undergoes a period of consolidation 
some of our competitors are expanding their size and financial resources through consolidation 
some travel management companies may have relationships with travel suppliers that give them access to favorable availability of products  including airplane seats and hotel rooms  or more competitive pricing than that offered by us 
furthermore  some corporate travel management companies have a strong presence in particular geographic areas that may make it difficult for us to attract clients in those areas 
as a result of competitive pressures  we may suffer a loss of clients  and our revenues or margins may decline 
we also compete with online travel providers as well as travel suppliers  including airlines  hotels and rental car companies 
innovations in technology  such as the internet and computer online services  have increased the ability of travel suppliers to distribute their travel products and some limited services directly to the consumer 
although corporate travel management companies and travel agencies remain the primary channel for travel distribution  businesses and consumers can use the internet to access information about travel products and services and to purchase such products and services directly from the suppliers  thus bypassing corporate travel management companies and travel agents 
we believe that no single internet based service presently provides access to the full range of information or services that we can provide 
an internet based travel service may  however  provide such access in the future 
we believe that we compete for clients based upon service  price and specialized knowledge 
we believe that we are well positioned to compete on these bases due to our combination of size and regional focus 
we use our size to achieve operating efficiencies by implementing customized and industry standard technologies and by consolidating administrative functions 
our size also provides opportunities to negotiate favorable arrangements with travel suppliers  such as airlines  hotels and rental car companies 
our regional focus  conversely  fosters personalized customer service and specialized local market knowledge  which help improve customer service  solidify customer relationships and expand our customer base 
management information systems we use networked management information systems for financial management  reporting and communication 
these systems provide management with current financial information from all of our offices  and allow management to share that information easily and quickly with others 
the systems also allow management to communicate efficiently with associates and each other throughout the business day 
we employ technicians to administer  install and maintain our computer hardware and software  as well as computer programmers to create software solutions for us and our customers 
we began implementing a single  company wide information technology platform to service our accounting and reporting requirements in  and with the exception of satotravel and acquisitions made in the last six months  of our north american transactions are currently being transacted on the same platform 
we continue to evaluate the consolidation of satotravel s system and expect to consolidate their transactions when it is appropriate to do so 
employees as of march   we had approximately  full time associates  none of whom is subject to collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that we enjoy good relations with our associates 
item properties 
as of march   we operated travel agency facilities  all of which are leased 
we operated travel agency facilities in the united states and internationally 
we believe that our properties are generally in good condition  are well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate to carry on our business at capacity for the foreseeable future 
our headquarters facility is also leased
