item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this transition report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see the disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
all references to years  unless otherwise noted  refer to our twelve month fiscal year  which prior to july   ended on june for example  a reference to or fiscal year means the twelve month period that ended on june  overview we are a large business consulting  systems integration and managed services firm  serving global companies  medium sized businesses  government agencies and other organizations 
we provide business and technology strategy  systems design  architecture  applications implementation  network  systems integration and managed services 
our service offerings are designed to help our clients generate revenue  reduce costs and access the information necessary to operate their business on a timely basis 
we provide consulting services through industry groups in which we have significant industry specific knowledge 
our focus on specific industries provides us with the ability to tailor our service offerings to reflect our understanding of the marketplaces in which our clients operate 
we have multinational operations covering north america  latin america  the asia pacific region  and europe  the middle east and africa emea 
we utilize this multinational network to provide consistent integrated services to our clients throughout the world 
on february   our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from a twelve month period ending june to a twelve month period ending december as a requirement of this change  the results for the six month period from july  to december  are reported as a separate transition period 
several external factors directly influence our ability to generate business 
the economic conditions in the industries and regions we serve are a significant factor affecting the results of our operations 
the pace of technological change and the type and level of technology spending by our clients also drive our business 
changes in business requirements and practices of our clients have a significant impact on the demand for the technology consulting and systems integration services we provide 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from professional services activities 
our revenue is driven by our ability to continuously generate new opportunities  by the prices we obtain for our service offerings  and by the size and chargeability  or utilization  of our professional workforce 
our revenue includes all amounts that are billed or billable to clients  including out of pocket costs such as travel and subsistence for client service professional staff  costs of hardware and software  and costs of subcontractors collectively referred to as other direct contract expenses 
our revenue for the six months ended december  was  million 
this represents an increase in revenue of million  or  from revenue generated during the six months ended december  of  million 
when compared to the six months ended december   revenue for our international regions increased million  while revenue for our north america region declined million 
revenue for our international regions increased predominantly due to the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations on reported revenue and the positive impact of international acquisitions made during the first quarter of fiscal year  while revenue for our north america region declined primarily due to slower economic conditions  pricing pressures and competition for new engagements 

table of contents as a multinational company  our international operations  whose functional currency is the local currency  may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the strengthening of foreign currencies primarily the euro against the us dollar has resulted in a currency translation that has increased our reported us dollar revenue and expense items during the six months ended december  in constant currency terms  our consolidated revenue for the six months ended december  has decreased million  or  when compared to the six months ended december  as mentioned above  this decrease was predominantly due to a decline in revenue for our north america region  partially offset by the positive impact of acquisitions made during the first quarter of fiscal year the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on our income before taxes was less than for the six months ended december  a weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could reduce reported revenue and expense items during future periods 
commencing with our first acquisition of an international practice mexico in december  we have been executing a strategy to develop a global business platform primarily through acquisitions all of the transactions referred to below are accounted for as purchase business acquisitions  and will therefore be referred to in this form k as acquisitions 
during fiscal year  we significantly expanded our european presence with the purchase of kpmg consulting ag subsequently renamed bearingpoint gmbh be germany  which included approximately  employees primarily in germany  switzerland and austria 
we furthered our global strategy  enabling us to better serve our multinational clients  by acquiring all  or portions of selected andersen business consulting practices in brazil  finland  france  japan  norway  peru  singapore  south korea  spain  sweden  switzerland and in the united states  and the consulting practice of the kpmg international member firm in finland 
in addition  we strengthened our latin american business with the acquisition of ernst young s brazilian consulting practice 
through december   we have completed acquisitions 
for the six months ended december   international operations outside north america represented of our business measured in revenue dollars  compared to  and for the years ended june   and  respectively 
during the six month period ended december   we determined that a triggering event had occurred in our emea reporting unit  causing us to perform a goodwill impairment test 
the triggering event resulted from adverse changes in the business climate affecting our european operations  which caused our operating profit and cash flows for the emea reporting unit to be lower than expected for the six months ended december  in response to this challenging economic environment in europe  we revised our emea growth expectations and anticipated operational efficiencies for the next five years 
as a result of the impairment test  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million per share since the carrying amount of our emea reporting unit was greater than the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as determined using the expected present value of future cash flows and the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill 
although we lowered growth expectations for the european region  we continue to forecast future growth and overall profitability throughout emea 
we also determined that there were no triggering events within our other reporting units that would have required further valuation analysis of goodwill 
the sustained economic downturn during calendar year has continued to negatively affect the operations of some of our clients and  in turn  impact their information technology it spending 
during this time  competition for new engagements has remained strong 
despite the cautious it spending and competition for new engagements  our bookings remained solid during the six months ended december   with a positive book to bill ratio in six out of seven of our business units 
the focus of our dedicated sales force and strong relationships with key accounts has enabled us to maintain strong bookings 
we continue to experience pricing pressures as competition for new engagements remains strong and as movements toward the use of lower cost service delivery personnel continue to grow within our industry 
despite pricing pressures  we improved or substantially maintained our billing rates across all regions 
billing rates for our north american operations remained steady for the six months ended december   declining when compared to the six months ended december  billing rates for our emea and asia pacific 
table of contents operations improved and  respectively  during the six months ended december  when compared to the same period during the prior year  while billing rates for our latin america operations remained steady 
our global presence and experienced  highly skilled workforce have enabled us to successfully differentiate our value and capabilities from those of our competitors  in effect  lessening the impact of current market pricing pressures 
we anticipate continued pricing pressures going forward  however  we are working to maintain our margins by complementing our solutions offerings with greater offshore capabilities 
on february   we announced the opening of our india global development center gdc 
our new india gdc  along with our existing china gdc  deliver high quality  low cost software development and it services to our global clients as part of our global technology services gts 
our gdcs utilize lower cost  highly skilled  offshore development staff to develop  support  and maintain our clients software applications 
as our gts capabilities continue to grow  we can rely less on the use of subcontractors to complete engagements  which should result in improvement in our overall profit margin 
we also have responded to the overall challenging business conditions by focusing on a variety of revenue growth and cost control initiatives  including continued evaluation of the size of our workforce and our required office space in relation to overall client demand for services  eliminating excess capacity and aggressively reducing discretionary costs to lower the cost of operations and maintain profit margins 
gross profit for the six months ended december  was million compared with million for the six months ended december  gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to during the current period compared to during the six months ended december  the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is due in part to a million charge related to a reduction in workforce recorded during the current period and the million charge for lease  facilities and other exit costs recorded during the period related to our previously announced reduction in office space 
the reduction in workforce charge recorded during the current period was the result of our effort to align our workforce with market demand for services 
as of december   we have approximately  employees  including approximately  client service personnel 
our ability to maintain the chargeability  or utilization  of our client service personnel directly impacts our revenue 
utilization represents the percentage of time spent by our client service personnel on billable work 
our utilization during the six months ended december  improved across all regions when compared to utilization during the six months ended december  utilization within our north america  emea  asia pacific and latin america regions increased   and  respectively  when compared to the six months ended december  this increase is primarily the result of aligning our workforce with market demand for services and successfully integrating our personnel acquired through acquisitions made during the first quarter of fiscal year we have successfully achieved savings in professional compensation expense as a result of our workforce reduction actions 
overall  we believe that our workforce is in line with market demand for services and the needs of the business  however  as economic conditions begin to rebound in certain markets  we will continue to hire qualified employees with the advanced information technology skills necessary to perform the services we offer 
during the current period we recorded a million charge for lease  facilities  and other exit costs in order to reduce our overall office space in an effort to eliminate excess capacity and to align our office space usage with our current workforce and the needs of the business 
we expect to incur additional lease and facilities charges of approximately million to million during the first half of calendar year our office space reduction efforts are expected to result in a reduction of our calendar year occupancy costs of approximately million 
for the six months ended december   we recorded a loss before taxes of million and provided for income taxes of million  resulting in a negative effective tax rate of 
our effective tax rate continues to be negatively affected by unusable losses in our foreign operations 
additionally  due to a 
table of contents history of losses and restrictions under tax laws  generally no tax benefit can be recognized in connection with the million current period goodwill impairment charge 
our profitable operations continue to be concentrated in relatively high tax rate jurisdictions  which results in tax expense being generated on our overall consolidated loss for the period 
segments through fiscal year  we conducted operations within five reportable segments 
our reportable segments were representative of the five major industry groups in which we have industry specific knowledge  including public services  communications content  financial services  consumer and industrial markets and high technology 
upon completion of a series of international acquisitions during the first quarter of fiscal year  we established three international operating segments emea and the asia pacific and latin america regions 
effective july   we combined our consumer and industrial markets and high technology industry groups to form the consumer  industrial and technology industry group 
for the six months ended december   we have seven reportable segments in addition to the corporate other category which consists primarily of infrastructure costs 
our chief operating decision maker  the chairman and chief executive officer  evaluates performance and allocates resources based upon the segments 
accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
upon consolidation  all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated 
inter segment revenue is not included in the measure of profit or loss and total assets for each reportable segment 
performance of the segments is evaluated based on operating income excluding the costs of infrastructure functions such as information systems  finance and accounting  human resources  legal and marketing as described in note  segment information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
prior year segment information has been reclassified to reflect current year presentation

we generally enter into long term  fixed price  time and materials and cost plus contracts to design  develop or modify multifaceted  client specific information technology systems 
we generally recognize the majority of our revenue on a time and materials or percentage of completion basis as services are provided see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we enter into contracts with our clients that contain varying terms and conditions 
these contracts generally provide that they can be terminated without significant advance notice or penalty 
generally  in the event that a client terminates a project  the client remains obligated to pay for services performed and expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 
costs of service

income tax expense 
our effective tax rate is significantly impacted by our level of pre tax earnings and non deductible expenses 
accordingly  if our pre tax earnings grow and non deductible expenses grow at a slower rate or decrease  our effective tax rate will decrease 
due to our high level of non deductible travel related expenses and unusable foreign tax losses and credits  our effective tax rate exceeds statutory rates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management s estimates and assumptions are derived and continually evaluated based on available information  reasonable judgment and the company s experience 
because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounting policies and estimates that management believes are most critical to the company s financial condition and operating results pertain to revenue recognition including estimates of costs to complete engagements  valuation of accounts receivable  valuation of goodwill  and effective income tax rates 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of these and other significant accounting policies

management anticipates that the collection of these amounts will occur within one year of the balance sheet date  with the exception of approximately million related to various long term contracts with certain government agencies 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the applicable revenue recognition criteria are met 

table of contents services we generally enter into long term  fixed price  time and materials  and cost plus contracts to design  develop or modify multifaceted client specific information technology systems 
such arrangements represent a significant portion of our business and are accounted for in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
arrangements accounted for under sop must have a binding  legally enforceable contract in place before revenue can be recognized 
revenue under fixed price contracts is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon costs to the client incurred as a percentage of the total estimated costs to the client 
revenue under time and materials contracts is based on fixed billable rates for hours delivered plus reimbursable costs 
revenue under cost plus contracts is recognized based upon reimbursable costs incurred plus estimated fees earned thereon 
we also enter into fixed price and time and materials contracts to provide general business consulting services  including  but not limited to  systems selection or assessment  feasibility studies  and business valuation and corporate strategy services 
such arrangements are accounted for in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue from such arrangements is recognized when  i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  ii the fee is fixed or determinable  iii services have been rendered and payment has been contractually earned  and  iv collectibility of the related receivable or unbilled revenue is reasonably assured 
additionally  we enter into arrangements in which we manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and systems provided to the client 
revenue from these types of arrangements is typically recognized on a ratable basis as earned over the term of the service period 
we periodically perform reviews of estimated revenue and costs on all of our contracts at an individual engagement level to assess whether they are consistent with initial assumptions 
any changes to estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the change is identified 
losses on contracts are recognized when identified 
software we enter into a limited number of software licensing arrangements 
we recognize software license fee revenue in accordance with the provisions of sop  software revenue recognition and its related interpretations 
our software licensing arrangements typically include multiple elements  such as software products  post contract customer support  and consulting and training services 
the aggregate arrangement fee is allocated to each of the undelivered elements based upon vendor specific evidence of fair value vsoe  with the residual of the arrangement fee allocated to the delivered elements 
vsoe for each individual element is determined based upon prices charged to customers when these elements are sold separately 
fees allocated to each software element of the arrangement are recognized as revenue when the following criteria have been met  i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the product has occurred  iii the license fee is fixed or determinable  and  iv collectibility of the related receivable is probable 
if evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time as evidence of fair value does exist  or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
fees allocated to post contract customer support are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the support period 
fees allocated to other services are recognized as revenue as the services are performed 
revenue from monthly license charge or hosting arrangements is recognized on a subscription basis over the period in which the client uses the product 
multiple element arrangements for service offerings in certain arrangements  we enter into contracts that include the delivery of a combination of two or more of our service offerings 
such arrangements are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
typically  such multiple element arrangements incorporate the design  development or modification of systems and an ongoing obligation to manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and systems provided to the client 
such contracts are divided into separate units of accounting  and the total arrangement fee is allocated to each unit based on its relative fair value 
revenue is recognized separately  and in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  for each element 

table of contents valuation of accounts receivable 
periodically  we review accounts receivable to reassess our estimates of collectibility 
we provide valuation reserves for bad debts based on specific identification of likely and probable losses 
in addition  we provide valuation reserves for estimates of aged receivables that may be written off based upon historical experience 
these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable becomes available 
circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality  other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due  and the quality of our collection efforts 
valuation of goodwill 
effective july   the company early adopted the new accounting principle related to goodwill  sfas no 
as a consequence  we recognized a transitional impairment loss of million  net of tax  per share as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
this transitional impairment loss resulted from the change in method of measuring impairments 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is the amount for which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
the goodwill impairment test requires us to identify our reporting units and obtain estimates of the fair values of those units as of the testing date 
our reporting units are our north american industry groups and our international geographic regions 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models 
those models require estimates of future revenue  profits  capital expenditures and working capital for each unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
we conduct our annual impairment test as of april of each year 
the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we monitor our goodwill balance for impairment and conduct formal tests when impairment indicators are present 
a decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units below its carrying value is an indicator that the underlying goodwill of the unit is potentially impaired 
this situation would require the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine whether the reporting unit s goodwill is impaired 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
an impairment loss is required for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill would then become the new cost basis of the unit s goodwill 
effective income tax rates 
determining effective income tax rates is highly dependent upon management estimates and judgments  particularly at each interim reporting date 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of effective income tax rates to change include restrictions on the use of the company s foreign subsidiary losses to reduce the company s tax burden  actual and projected pre tax income  changes in law  and audits by taxing authorities 
financial statement presentation the consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the company and all of its majority owned subsidiaries 
upon consolidation  all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated 
certain of the company s consolidated foreign subsidiaries within emea and the asia pacific region report their results of operations on a one month lag 
on february   we changed our fiscal year end from a twelve month period ending june to a twelve month period ending december as a requirement of this change  the results for the six month period from july  to december  are reported as a separate transition period within the consolidated financial statements

table of contents six months ended december  compared to six months ended december  revenue 
revenue increased million  or less than  from  million during the six months ended december   to  million during the six months ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue within our international operating segments totaling million  offset by a decline in north america revenue of million 
revenue from our international operations for the six months ended december  was million  an increase of when compared to the same period in the prior year 
our international operations experienced a increase in engagement hours as well as a increase in average billing rates 
our north america revenue for the six months ended december  of  million declined when compared to the same period in the prior year 
the decline in our north america revenue was primarily the result of a slow economy and cautious it spending 
in north america  we experienced a decrease in engagement hours as well as decrease in our average billing rates 
although our revenue for the six months ended december  remained relatively flat when compared to the six months ended december   we are beginning to see many positive economic indicators in the us and internationally  however  growth in it spending remains isolated to certain specific markets and regions 
despite the cautious it spending  our bookings have remained solid  with a positive book to bill ratio in six out of our seven business units during the six months ended december  our workforce is experiencing healthy utilization  with a growing need to hire additional employees with advanced skill sets in rebounding markets 
as revenues increase  our goal is to first increase utilization and then to increase headcount 
although billing rates have generally held steady for the company as a whole  we continue to face rate pressures due to client return on investment demands and competitor pricing 
we anticipate rate pressures to continue going forward  therefore we remain focused on differentiating our values and capabilities from those of our competitors  and look to complement our solutions offerings with greater offshore capabilities in order to maintain profit margins 
public services  the company s largest business unit  generated revenue during the six months ended december  of million  representing an increase of million  or  over the six months ended december  this increase was predominantly the result of growth in the federal business sector  driven by success on international engagements 
revenue for our state  local education sled business sector decreased due to the impact of state budget and spending constraints 
overall  our public services business unit experienced increases in both engagement hours and billing rates of and  respectively  despite both client driven and competitor driven pricing pressures 
our public services business unit maintained a strong win rate during the six months ended december   as we were awarded out of large north american projects that we competed for during the period 
the communications content business unit generated revenue of million during the six months ended december   representing a decline of million  or  from the six months ended december  this decline was primarily the result of our completion of several large contracts involving testing related to compliance with the telecommunications act 
while engaged on compliance testing contracts  certain clients decided to curtail the company s involvement in non compliance related projects 
due to the exhaustive nature and extent of the compliance testing  we do not expect these clients to engage our company for many of their future projects  as such  engagement hours have declined 
in addition  pricing pressures within the communications industry have resulted in a decrease in billing rates 
although the communications content pipeline is growing  we do not expect to see growth in this business unit late in calendar year our financial services business unit generated revenue during the six months ended december  of million  representing growth of million  or over the six months ended december  the increase in revenue was principally due to a increase in engagement hours and an increase in reimbursable 
table of contents out of pocket engagement costs 
the financial services business unit experienced significant growth in the banking insurance sector  which was partially offset by a decline in the global markets sector 
billing rates for the six months ended december  remained consistent with the same period during the prior year  despite pricing pressure from both our clients and competition in the banking insurance and global markets sectors 
we anticipate continued pricing pressure for the first half of calendar year  however we expect to see improvement in both sectors  including steady revenue growth  as we position ourselves to benefit from our highly skilled and technically advanced workforce 
the consumer  industrial and technology business unit generated revenue during the six months ended december  of million  representing a decline of million  or  over the six months ended december  the decline was primarily the result of challenging economic conditions  which have led to a decrease in technology spending 
revenue was significantly impacted by the cancellation of two of our larger accounts 
when compared to the same period in the prior year  engagement hours decreased and billing rates decreased during the six months ended december  our pipeline remains stable and we expect revenue  bill rates and utilization to remain flat for the first half of calendar year the emea business unit generated revenue of million during the six months ended december   representing growth of million  or  over the six months ended december  the growth in our reported emea revenue resulted from a strengthening of foreign currencies primarily the euro against the us dollar during the six months ended december  in constant currency terms  revenue for our emea business unit for the six months ended december  declined by approximately when compared to the six months ended december  this decline is the result of a decrease in engagement hours caused by the adverse changes in the business climate within certain of our emea operations 
in response to this trend  we completed a reduction in workforce during the six months ended december   resulting in an increase in our utilization of approximately for the six months ended december  when compared to the six months ended december  the asia pacific business unit generated revenue of million during the six months ended december  representing growth of million  or  over the six months ended december  this revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in utilization and an increase in engagement hours as well as the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar 
the increases in utilization and engagement hours were a result of strong bookings in japan and the continued integration of acquisitions made during the six months ended december  throughout the region 
we experienced improvement in our performance within greater china  and continue to focus on the emerging economies of southeast asia such as thailand  malaysia and singapore 
revenue for korea  australia and new zealand for the six months ended december  remained consistent with revenue for the six months ended december  due to difficult market conditions within these countries  which negatively impacted it spending 
our latin america business unit generated revenue of million during the six months ended december   representing growth of million  or  over the six months ended december  the increase in revenue is primarily due to the positive impact of the acquisitions made during the first quarter of fiscal year  as well as increased volume within mexico and brazil 
this increase is reflected in a growth in engagement hours  while our utilization improved and our billing rate per hour in the region remained steady despite increased pricing pressure within this market 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined to for the six months ended december   compared to for the six months ended december  this decline is mainly attributable to an increase in other direct contract expenses and the impact of the million lease and facilities charge related to office space reductions and the million reduction in workforce charge recorded during the six months ended december  in dollar terms  gross profit decreased by million  or  from 
table of contents million for the six months ended december   to million for the six months ended december  the decrease in gross profit was due to the increase in revenue of million described above  offset by the following a net increase in professional compensation of million  or less than  from million for the six months ended december   to million for the six months ended december  professional compensation expense for the six months ended december  includes a million charge related to a reduction in workforce recorded during the period 
the impact of this charge was significantly offset by savings achieved through our workforce reduction actions in response to the challenging economy 
a net increase in other direct contract expenses of million  or  from million  or of revenue  for the six months ended december   to million  or of revenue  for the six months ended december  the million increase in other direct contract expenses is mainly attributable to our increased use of subcontractors and higher levels of materials procurement  particularly in both the public services and emea business units 
the increase in other direct contract expenses  including the cost of subcontractors  has negatively impacted our gross profit  as the cost of subcontractors is generally more expensive than the cost of our own workforce 
we are focused on limiting the use of subcontractors whenever possible  working to increase our margins by complementing our solutions offerings with greater offshore capabilities  and increasing our hiring in order to balance our skill base with the market demand for our services 
a net decrease in other costs of service of million  or  from million for the six months ended december   to million for the six months ended december  the decline in other costs of service is primarily attributable to savings achieved as a result of our office space reduction efforts 
during the six months ended december   we recorded  within the corporate other operating segment  a charge of million for lease  facilities and other exit costs related to our previously announced reduction in office space primarily within the north america  emea and asia pacific regions 
we reduced our overall office space in an effort to eliminate excess capacity and to align our office space usage with our current workforce and the needs of the business 
the million lease and facilities charge included million related to the fair value of future lease obligations net of estimated sublease income  million representing the unamortized cost of fixed assets and million in other costs associated with exiting facilities

quarterly summarized financial information restatement the company experienced significant activity for the fiscal year ended june  during this period  we considerably expanded our global presence adding consulting resources in eight additional countries through 
table of contents purchase business acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in august  we reported that we would restate our financial results for the first three quarters of fiscal year the restatements required us to amend our previously filed form q s for each of the quarterly periods within fiscal year the restatements occurred in the following general areas purchase accounting resulting from the application of sfas no 
 business combinations  and eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  revenue recognition related to contract accounting and the application of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  the accounting treatment of accrued liabilities and the use of estimated months to account for operations subsequent to certain international business acquisitions  and the accounting treatment of stock awards and related shareholder notes 
in total these adjustments resulted in a decrease in previously reported net income and earnings per share in the first  second and third quarters of fiscal year of million  or per share  million or per share and million  or per share  respectively 
summarized below is a more detailed discussion of the restatements 
purchase accounting during the quarter ended september   we completed various acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase business acquisitions  resulting in approximately million in identified intangible assets 
these acquisitions included the purchase of kpmg consulting ag  a substantial consulting practice in germany  and the purchase of all or parts of a number of andersen business consulting practices worldwide 
we completed preliminary purchase price allocations to allocate the purchase prices to acquired assets and assumed liabilities 
the excess of the cost of the acquired entities over the amounts assigned to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill 
as part of the initial purchase price allocation  value was ascribed to only contractual backlog order backlog and a trade name 
this initial allocation was determined to be too low  and accordingly  an additional million of value for identified intangible assets related to customer contracts and related customer relationships was allocated to these identified intangible assets with a corresponding reduction to goodwill 
the additional intangible assets are being amortized over useful lives ranging from to months 
as a result  approximately million  million and million of incremental amortization of purchased intangible assets was recorded in the quarters ended september   december  and march   respectively 
during the fiscal year ended june  we completed a series of restructurings related to many of our purchase business acquisitions increasing goodwill by approximately million and million for the quarters ended december  and march   respectively  for certain charges relating to exiting from leased facilities 
it was determined that these charges did not satisfy the criteria to be included in purchase accounting in accordance with eitf  and were therefore deducted from goodwill and charged to costs of service 
contract accounting in one of our international consulting practices  we identified an accumulation of work in process on our balance sheet 
we identified approximately million  million and million in revenue related to pre contract activities that was inappropriately recognized in the quarters ended september   december  and march   respectively 
as such  these amounts were reversed from revenue  as no contractual arrangement existed at the time the amounts were recorded and recovery of these costs was not considered probable 

table of contents in addition  we identified certain circumstances where the percentage of completion method as prescribed under sop was not appropriately applied 
on a combined net basis  approximately million and million was reversed from revenue in the quarters ended september  and march   respectively  and approximately million of additional revenue was recognized in the quarter ended december  in addition  costs of service was reduced by approximately million and million in the quarters ended september  and march   respectively  and increased by million in the quarter ended december accruals during fiscal year  we recorded accrued liabilities for our fringe benefits based on cost factors associated with projected labor hours 
during fiscal year  we did not adjust the accrual as assumptions were revised 
as a result  adjustments to correct the calculated fringe benefit accruals of approximately million and million reduced costs of service for the quarters ended september  and december   respectively  and increased costs of service by approximately million for the quarter ended march  in connection with an increase in our deductible for our professional indemnity insurance  we established an accrued liability of million during the quarter ended march  this accrued liability was determined to be unwarranted and was therefore reversed  resulting in a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we completed a number of business acquisitions 
at the end of the first post transaction fiscal reporting period the quarter ended september   certain of the entities were not able to close their books on a timely basis for us public reporting purposes 
as a result  in an effort to conform to a fiscal year convention  we recorded an estimated month income statement and a net asset or liability account on the balance sheet for those entities 
we restated the respective quarters on a conforming fiscal period end  and have eliminated the effect of the estimated month 
we reduced revenue by million and million for the quarters ended september  and december   respectively  and increased revenue by million for the quarter ended march   decreased costs of service by million and million for the quarters ended september  and december   respectively  and increased costs of service by million for the quarter ended march   reduced selling  general and administrative expenses by million and million for the quarters ended september  and march   respectively  and increased selling  general and administrative expenses by million for the quarter ended december  stock awards and shareholders notes we initially accounted for certain stock awards in prior years as fixed plan grants  with related payments to the respective employees for tax liabilities accounted for as interest bearing shareholder notes 
the initial accounting was revised to treat the awards as a variable grant 
the revision did not have a material impact on the statements of operations for any prior periods and therefore prior years financial statements were not restated 
instead  the aggregate effect of the revised accounting was reflected as adjustments to additional paid in capital  retained earnings accumulated deficit and notes receivable from stockholders as of july  in addition  under the revised accounting  reserves recorded against the shareholder notes during the quarters ended september   december   and march  were not necessary and were reversed decreasing selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately million  million and million for the quarters ended september   december   and march   respectively 
other adjustments impacting net income other adjustments that were recorded were identified through both timely quarterly reviews as well as during the year end closing process and ordinary course of the audit 
these adjustments were not material either individually or in the aggregate to income before taxes 

table of contents reclassifications not impacting net income statement of operations reclassification adjustments were identified through both timely quarterly reviews as well as during the year end closing process and ordinary course of the audit 
the reclassifications were made to conform the amounts previously reported to the restated presentations 
these reclassifications did not impact net income 
statement of operations the following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the last ten quarters 
in management s opinion  the quarterly information contains all adjustments necessary to fairly present such information 
as a professional services organization  we anticipate and respond to service demands from our clients 
accordingly  we have limited control over the timing and circumstances under which our services are provided

during fiscal year  we and kpmg llp agreed that we would pay termination costs for certain services relating to human resources  training  purchasing  facilities management and knowledge management of million 
in august  we reached a settlement with kpmg llp relating to a dispute about the determination of costs under the transition services agreement  resulting in kpmg llp paying us million 
during the year ended june   we terminated certain human resources services for which we were charged million in termination costs 
during the year ended june   we also recovered million as a result of our review of kpmg llp s charges for fiscal year and related adjustments to the charges for fiscal year during the six months ended december   we terminated certain technology services for which we were charged million in termination costs 
in addition  we recovered million as a result of our review of kpmg llp s charges for fiscal year and related adjustments to the charges for the six months ended december  effective october   we and kpmg llp entered into an outsourcing services agreement under which kpmg llp provides certain services relating to office space that were previously provided under the transition services agreement 
the services will be provided for three years at a cost that is less than the cost for comparable services under the transition services agreement 
additionally  kpmg llp has agreed that there will be no termination costs with respect to the office related services at the end of the three year term of the outsourcing services agreement 
at this time there are no terminated services for which termination costs remain unknown 
the amount of termination costs that we will pay to kpmg llp depends upon the timing of service terminations  the ability of the parties to work together to minimize the costs  and the amount of payments required under existing contracts with third parties for services provided to us by kpmg llp and which can continue to be obtained directly by us thereafter 
the amount of termination costs that we will pay to kpmg llp under the transition services agreement with respect to services that are terminated after december  cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
we believe that the amount of termination costs yet to be assessed will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  cash flows  or liquidity in a particular quarter or fiscal year cannot be determined at this time 
during the fiscal year ended june   we purchased from kpmg llp million of leasehold improvements 
based on information currently available  we anticipate paying kpmg llp approximately million to million for the sale and transfer of additional capital assets such as computer equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements 
currently we contract for the use of such capital assets through the transition services agreement for which usage charges are included in the monthly costs under the agreement 
we made no additional purchases of capital assets from kpmg llp during the six months ended december  
table of contents during the first half of fiscal year  we significantly expanded our international operations through acquisitions 
some of our acquired operations had pre existing defined benefit pension plans  and as such we have become the sponsor of these plans 
we use the actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  to account for our pension plans 
our pension plans include both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that provide benefits based on years of service and salary 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was million  of which million represents the unfunded portion of this liability 
we also sponsor an unfunded postretirement medical plan 
this plan is accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  which requires the company to accrue for future postretirement medical benefits 
as of december   the net liability for our postretirement medical benefits was million 
in the normal course of business  we have indemnified third parties and have commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in certain circumstances 
these indemnities  commitments and guarantees include indemnities of kpmg llp with respect to the consulting business that was transferred to us in january  indemnities to third parties in connection with performance bonds  indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases  indemnities to customers related to intellectual property and performance of services subcontracted to other providers  and indemnities to directors and officers under the organizational documents of the company 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  is indefinite 
certain of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make 
as of december   we have approximately million of outstanding bid and performance bonds and million of outstanding letters of credit for which we may be required to make future payment 
we have never incurred material costs to settle claims or defend lawsuits related to these indemnities  commitments and guarantees 
as a result  the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  no liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of december  we continue to actively manage client billings and collections and maintain tight controls over discretionary spending 
we believe that the cash provided from operations  borrowings available under the various existing credit facilities  and existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we also believe that we will generate enough cash from operations  have sufficient borrowing capacity under the various existing credit facilities including the million revolving credit facility and have sufficient access to the capital markets to meet our long term liquidity needs 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf issued a final consensus on issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
issue limits the amount of revenue that can be allocated to a delivered element to the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element 
if the amount of non contingent revenue allocated to a delivered element is less than the costs to deliver such services  then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenue becomes non contingent 
issue is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  companies may also elect to apply the provisions of issue to existing arrangements and record the income statement impact as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
effective july   we adopted issue on a prospective basis 
the adoption of issue did not have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is effective for instruments entered into or modified after may  and was otherwise effective for our quarter ended september  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

the provisions of fin no
