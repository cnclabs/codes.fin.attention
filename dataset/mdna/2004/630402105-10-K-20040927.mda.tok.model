item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements 
these judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  concentration of credit risk  inventory  goodwill  and income taxes 
revenue recognition revenues from merchandise sales are recorded at the time the product is shipped or delivered to the customer pursuant to the terms of purchase 
we report our sales levels on a net sales basis  which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns and allowances 
our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales and income 
this accrual is calculated based on a history of gross sales and actual sales returns  as well as management s estimate of anticipated returns and allowances 
as a percentage of gross sales  sales returns and allowances were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
concentration of credit risk an entity is more vulnerable to concentrations of credit risk if it is exposed to risk of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risk through diversification of customers 
such risks of loss manifest themselves differently  depending on the nature of the concentration  and vary in significance 
the company had two customers customer a and b with accounts receivable balances that aggregated and of the company s accounts receivable at june  and  respectively 
sales to neither of these customers exceeded of net sales in any of the past three years 
the company had a third customer customer c whose accounts receivable balance was of the company s accounts receivable at june  the company had no accounts receivable due from this customer as of june  this customer accounted for  and of the company s net sales in fiscal  and during the past three fiscal years no other customer represented more than of the company s net sales 
the company terminated its relationship with customer c in fiscal the termination of this customer did not have a materially adverse effect on the company s operations 
in the ordinary course of business  we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of  and  as of june  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings 
this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable agings  specific exposures and historical trends 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale 
the reported net value of our inventory includes finished saleable products  work in process and raw materials that will be sold or used in future periods 
inventory cost includes raw materials  direct labor and overhead 
we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve  which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value  based on various product sales projections 
this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age  historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales 
in addition  and as necessary  we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 
goodwill effective july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements established accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
specifically  the standards address how acquired intangible assets should be accounted for both at the time of acquisition and after they have been recognized in the financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 intangible assets  including purchased goodwill  must be evaluated for impairment 
those intangible assets that are classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company completed its transitional impairment testing of intangible assets during the first quarter of fiscal that effort  and preliminary assessments of the company s identifiable intangible assets  indicated that no adjustment would be required upon adoption of this pronouncement 
the impairment testing is performed in two steps i the company determines impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  and ii if there is an impairment  the company measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the company has performed its annual impairment evaluation required by this standard and determined that the goodwill is not impaired
