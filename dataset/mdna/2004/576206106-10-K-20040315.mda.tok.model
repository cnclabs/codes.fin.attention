item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition md a under critical accounting policies  certain trends and uncertainties and elsewhere in md a  massey is subject to risk factors set forth below 
the level of massey s indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to grow and compete and prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its contracts and agreements at december   massey had million of total indebtedness outstanding  which represented of its total book capitalization 
the company has significant debt  lease and royalty obligations 
the company s ability to satisfy debt service  lease and royalty obligations and to effect any refinancing of its indebtedness will depend upon future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the markets that the company serves as well as financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the company may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings  or other financings may be unavailable in an amount sufficient to enable it to fund its debt service  lease and royalty payment obligations or its other liquidity needs 
the company s relative amount of debt could have material consequences to its business  including  but not limited to i making it more difficult to satisfy debt covenants and debt service  lease payment and other obligations  ii making it more difficult to pay quarterly dividends as the company has in the past  iii increasing the company s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  iv limiting the company s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements  v reducing the availability of cash flows from operations to fund acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes  vi limiting the company s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the company s business and the industry in which the company competes  or vii placing the company at a competitive disadvantage when compared to competitors with less relative amounts of debt 
the covenants in massey s credit facility and the indentures governing the notes impose restrictions that may limit massey s operating and financial flexibility massey s asset based loan credit facility  entered into in january  and the indentures governing its senior notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that may limit the company s ability and its subsidiaries ability to  among other things 
table of contents incur liens and debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person  increase common stock dividends above specified levels  make loans and investments  prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  engage in mergers  consolidations and asset dispositions  engage in affiliate transactions  create any lien or security interest in any real property or equipment  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  and restrict distributions from subsidiaries 
operating results below current levels or other adverse factors  including a significant increase in interest rates  could result in massey being unable to comply with certain debt covenants 
if massey violates these covenants and is unable to obtain waivers from its lenders  massey s debt under these agreements would be in default and could be accelerated by the lenders 
if the indebtedness is accelerated  massey may not be able to repay its debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if massey is able to obtain new financing  it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to massey 
if massey s debt is in default for any reason  its cash flows  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  complying with these covenants may also cause massey to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for massey to successfully execute its business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 
coal markets are highly competitive and affected by factors beyond massey s control massey competes with coal producers in various regions of the us for domestic sales and with both domestic and overseas producers for sales to international markets 
continued domestic demand for massey s coal and the prices that it will be able to obtain primarily will depend upon coal consumption patterns of the domestic electric utility industry and the domestic steel industry 
consumption by the domestic utility industry is affected by the demand for electricity  environmental and other governmental regulations  technological developments and the price of competing coal and alternative fuel supplies including nuclear  natural gas  oil and renewable energy sources  including hydroelectric power 
consumption by the domestic steel industry is primarily affected by the demand for us steel 
massey s sales of metallurgical coal are dependent on the continued financial viability of domestic steel companies and their ability to compete with steel producers abroad 
the cost of ocean transportation and the valuation of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies significantly impact the relative attractiveness of massey s coal as it competes on price with other foreign coal producing sources 
see item  business  under the heading competition  for further discussion 
coal prices are affected by a number of factors and may vary dramatically by region coal prices are influenced by a number of factors and may vary dramatically by region 
the two principal components of the price of coal are the price of coal at the mine  which is influenced by mine operating costs and coal quality  and the cost of transporting coal from the mine to the point of use 
the cost of mining the coal is influenced by geologic characteristics such as seam thickness  overburden ratios and depth of underground reserves 
underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of high capital costs  including costs for modern mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems and higher labor costs due to lower productivity 
massey currently engages in four principal coal mining techniques underground room and pillar mining  underground longwall mining  surface mining and highwall mining 
because underground longwall mining  surface mining and highwall mining are high productivity  low cost mining methods  massey seeks to increase production from its use of these methods to the extent permissible and cost 
table of contents effective 
the company presently operates active underground mines  including longwall mines  and active surface mines  with highwall miners 
see item  business  under the headings mining methods and mining operations for further discussion 
massey depends on continued demand from its customers reduced demand from massey s largest customers could have an adverse impact on massey s ability to achieve its projected revenue 
when massey s contracts with its customers reach expiration  there can be no assurance that the customers either will extend or enter into new long term contracts or  in the absence of long term contracts  that they will continue to purchase the same amount of coal as they have in the past or on terms  including pricing terms  as favorable as under existing agreements 
see item  business  under the heading customers and coal contracts for further discussion 
massey faces numerous uncertainties in estimating its economically recoverable coal reserves  and inaccuracies in its estimates could result in lower than expected revenues  higher than expected costs and decreased profitability there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves  including many factors beyond massey s control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about the company s reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by the company s staff 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties may vary substantially 
as a result  the company s estimates may not accurately reflect its actual reserves 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to its reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
union represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs at december   less than of massey s total workforce was represented by the united mine workers of america 
six of massey s coal preparation plants and one of its smaller surface mines have a workforce that is represented by a union 
in fiscal  these six preparation plants handled approximately of massey s coal production 
there may be an increased risk of strikes and other related work actions  in addition to higher labor costs  associated with these operations 
massey has experienced some union organizing campaigns at some of its open shop facilities within the past five years 
if some or all of massey s current open shop operations were to become union represented  massey could be subject to additional risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs 
increased labor costs or work stoppages could adversely affect the stability of production and reduce its net income 
severe weather may affect massey s ability to mine and deliver coal severe weather  including flooding and excessive ice or snowfall  when it occurs  can adversely affect massey s ability to produce  load and transport coal 

table of contents shortages of skilled labor in the central appalachian coal industry may pose a risk to achieving high labor productivity and competitive costs coal mining continues to be a labor intensive industry 
in  a shortage of trained coal miners developed in the central appalachian region causing the company to hire a large number of mine workers with less experience than its existing workforce 
while the company did not experience a comparable shortage in  if another such shortage of skilled labor were to arise  its productivity could decrease and its costs could increase 
such a lack of skilled miners could have an adverse impact on massey s labor productivity and cost and its ability to expand production in the event there is an increase in the demand for coal 
if the coal industry experiences overcapacity in the future  the company s profitability could be impaired historically  a growing coal market and increased demand for coal attract new investors to the coal industry  spur the development of new mines and result in added production capacity throughout the industry  all of which can lead to increased competition and lower coal prices 
similarly  an increase in future coal prices could encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers 
any overcapacity could reduce coal prices and therefore reduce the company s revenues 
terrorist attacks and threats  escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect the company s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition terrorist attacks and threats  escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect the company s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
the company s business is affected by general economic conditions  fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending  and market liquidity  which can decline as a result of numerous factors outside of its control  such as terrorist attacks and acts of war 
future terrorist attacks against us targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the us or its allies  or military or trade disruptions affecting the company s customers may materially adversely affect its operations 
as a result  there could be delays or losses in transportation and deliveries of coal to the company s customers  decreased sales of its coal and extension of time for payment of accounts receivable from its customers 
strategic targets such as energy related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the us in addition  disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government imposed price controls 
it is possible that any  or a combination  of these occurrences could have a material impact on the company s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition

item properties operations of massey and its subsidiaries are conducted on both owned and leased properties totaling more than  acres in west virginia  kentucky  virginia and tennessee 
in addition  certain owned or leased properties of massey and its subsidiaries are leased or subleased to third party tenants 
massey s current practice is to obtain a title review from a licensed attorney prior to purchasing or leasing property 
it generally has not obtained title insurance in connection with acquisitions of coal reserves 
in many cases  property title is warranted by the seller or lessor 
separate title confirmation sometimes is not required when leasing reserves where mining has occurred previously 
massey and its subsidiaries currently own or lease the equipment that is utilized in their mining operations 
the following table describes the location and general character of the major existing facilities  exclusive of mines  coal preparation plants and their adjoining offices 
administrative offices richmond  virginia owned massey corporate headquarters charleston  west virginia leased massey coal services headquarters chapmanville  west virginia leased massey coal services field office coal reserves massey estimates that  as of december   it had total recoverable reserves of approximately billion tons consisting of both proven and probable reserves 
reserves are defined by the sec industry guide as that part of a mineral deposit  which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
recoverable reserves means coal that is economically recoverable using existing equipment and methods under federal and state laws currently in effect 
approximately billion tons of massey s reserves are classified as proven reserves 
proven measured reserves are defined by the sec industry guide as reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
the remaining billion tons of massey s reserves are classified as probable reserves 
probable reserves are defined by the sec industry guide as reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven measured reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 

table of contents information about massey s reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by its internal engineers  geologists and finance associates 
reserve estimates are updated annually using geologic data taken from drill holes  adjacent mine workings  outcrop prospect openings and other sources 
coal tonnages are categorized according to coal quality  seam thickness  mineability and location relative to existing mines and infrastructure 
in accordance with applicable industry standards  proven reserves are those for which reliable data points are spaced no more than  feet apart 
probable reserves are those for which reliable data points are spaced  feet to  feet apart 
further scrutiny is applied using geological criteria and other factors related to profitable extraction of the coal 
these criteria include seam height  roof and floor conditions  yield and marketability 
as with most coal producing companies in central appalachia  the majority of massey s coal reserves are controlled pursuant to leases from third party landowners 
these leases convey mining rights to the coal producer in exchange for a per ton or percentage of gross sales price royalty payment to the lessor 
however  a significant portion of massey s reserve holdings are owned and require no royalty or per ton payment to other parties 
the average royalties for coal reserves from the company s producing properties owned and leased was approximately of produced coal revenue for the year ended december

preparation plant employees litigation on april   five subsidiaries of the company  along with other coal and chemical companies  were sued in an action styled denver pettry  et al 
v 
peabody holding company  et al  in the circuit court of boone county  west virginia  in which the plaintiffs allege that they were excessively exposed to chemicals used in the coal preparation plants of the defendant coal companies  which were manufactured by the defendant chemical companies 
the plaintiffs are attempting to attain class action status against the chemical companies  and seek to recover unquantified compensatory and punitive damages 
the company believes it has significant defenses to the claims made by plaintiffs against subsidiaries of the company  and is defending the case vigorously 
discovery in this case continues 
the company does not view this case as material and does not plan to report on it in future filings absent unexpected developments that could have a material impact on the company 
sidney spill on april   the wvdep filed a civil action against the company and its subsidiary  massey coal services  inc  in connection with the discharge of approximately  gallons of coal slurry into a tributary 
table of contents stream of the big sandy river in eastern kentucky 
in november  the parties settled this action for a de minimus amount 
wvdep litigation on october   wvdep brought suit against three massey subsidiaries  independence coal company and omar mining company in the circuit court of boone county  west virginia  and marfork coal company in the circuit court of raleigh county  west virginia 
the suits allege various violations of waste and clean water laws in and and seek unspecified amounts in fines as well as injunctive relief to compel compliance 
independence  omar and marfork believe that compliance has been achieved for these past violations and will defend the suits vigorously 
environmental show cause orders regulatory authorities implementing the smcra may order surface mining permit holders to show cause why their permits should not be suspended or revoked because of alleged patterns of violations 
a pattern of violations can be found when there are two or more violations of a same or similar type within a month period 
under these show cause orders  if a pattern of violations is found and determined to have been caused by the willful or unwarranted conduct of the company under the surface mining laws  its surface mining permits may be either suspended or revoked 
some of the company s subsidiaries have been issued show cause orders that are currently unresolved 
the outcome of each of these actions remains uncertain  so the eventual cost to the company  if any  cannot presently be reasonably estimated 
as of march   the wvdep had issued show cause orders with respect to active permits at the company s alex energy  inc  bandmill coal corporation  green valley coal company  independence coal company  inc  marfork coal company  inc and omar mining company subsidiaries 
in addition  the kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet knrepc had issued a show cause order with respect to an active permit at sidney coal company 
a suspension of these operations could adversely affect the company s financial results to the extent it is unable to generate the lost production from its other operations 
wvdep has also issued show cause orders with respect to idled permits at certain of the company s subsidiaries 
the company does not expect that these actions  either individually or collectively  will have a material impact on its cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
the potential impact on operations from a permit suspension in the show cause proceedings varies 
for example  some of the operations are not currently mining or processing coal  therefore  a suspension at those operations would not impact earnings 
at the active operations  suspensions could impact earnings to the extent that downtime cannot be offset by increases in production and or coal sales at other times or at other operations 
the impact of suspensions at these operations could also vary depending on when the suspensions are served 
for example  suspensions served over weekends or during scheduled maintenance periods would have lesser impacts 
the company does not believe the impact of the suspensions is likely to be material 
the company has not accrued lost profits for any wvdep or knrepc show cause order mentioned herein because the outcome of these matters cannot be reasonably estimated 
the cost of defending these matters is not material 
if the company is unsuccessful in defending or reaching an acceptable resolution of these orders  there is a possibility that a suspension of operations could have a significant effect on its overall operations 
if a subsidiary has a permit revoked and a bond forfeited  it may be prohibited from obtaining permits for future operations 
additionally  pursuant to the ownership and control provisions of the surface mining laws  operations affiliated with that subsidiary may also be deemed ineligible to receive new permits 
an inability by the company to receive permits necessary to mine would be material 
the company does not expect that any of these proceedings will result in permit revocation or bond forfeiture 

table of contents the company continues to make efforts to improve its environmental performance 
at the direction of the public and environmental policy committee of the company s board of directors  the company obtained a comprehensive environmental audit conducted by an independent environmental auditing firm and continues to conduct environmental audits that are regularly reviewed with the committee 
the company has also implemented an improved environmental management system 
the company has retained an independent environmental auditing firm to conduct a follow on audit in and believes that continuing follow on audits should be conducted every to years 
other legal proceedings massey and its subsidiaries  incident to their normal business activities  are parties to a number of other legal proceedings 
while massey cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings  it does not believe that any liability arising from these matters individually or in the aggregate should have a material impact upon the consolidated cash flows  results of operations or financial condition of massey 
the company also is party to lawsuits and other legal proceedings related to the non coal businesses previously conducted by fluor corporation renamed massey energy company but now conducted by new fluor 
under the terms of the distribution agreement entered into by the company and new fluor as of november   in connection with the spin off of new fluor by the company  new fluor has agreed to indemnify the company with respect to all such legal proceedings and has assumed their defense

on january   the company established an asset based revolving credit facility that provides for borrowings of up to million  depending on the level of eligible inventory and accounts receivable  and provides a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
in the second half of  demand for coal increased significantly due to a combination of conditions in the us and worldwide that caused a shortage of certain grades of coal  with a particularly acute shortage of metallurgical grade coal 
this situation has continued and accelerated in early prices for the grades of coal sold by massey have consequently risen materially since mid massey s ability to benefit from these price increases will be limited in  as the majority of the company s planned coal production was committed prior to the market improvements 
in order to maximize its revenues in  the company has begun shifting some production from the utility market to the export metallurgical market 
these tons were replaced primarily by steam coal purchased at current market prices 
the company is also focused on increasing its capacity of surface mine utility grade coal to meet increased market demand 
results of operations compared with revenues produced coal revenue for the year ended december  decreased percent to  million compared with  million for the year ended december  two factors that impacted produced coal revenue for compared to were the volume of produced tons sold decreased percent to million tons in from million tons in  attributable to a reduction in metallurgical tons sold of percent  partially offset by an increase in utility tons sold of percent  and the produced coal revenue per ton sold decreased percent to per ton in from per ton in  consisting of decreases of and percent in the prices for metallurgical and industrial coal  respectively  partially offset by an increase of percent in the price for utility coal 
the average per ton sales price decreased as some of the higher priced contracts signed in expired in and were replaced by lower priced contracts  and as a result of lower shipments of metallurgical and other higher quality coal in compared to metallurgical coal demand fell in due to weakness in the domestic steel industry throughout most of the year

the company experienced lower costs during the second quarter of  while costs in the other three quarters were negatively impacted by a variety of operational and shipping issues 
the most significant source of higher costs related to the company s longwall operations 
several longwall equipment moves took longer than planned  hard cutting at certain locations was experienced  and a methane gas pocket closed one of the mines for a period of time  reducing overall productivity at various times during the year 
the company is attempting to improve productivity at the longwall mines by adding higher horsepower shearers in order to facilitate cutting in more difficult coal seams 
in addition  bad weather slowed some surface mine operations and prevented timely shipments by rail or truck 
surface mine production was also impacted by higher than anticipated overburden ratios  slow receipt of required permits  higher diesel fuel costs and increased trucking costs due to new west virginia regulations 
the company purchased new surface mine equipment in late and early to increase capacity and productivity at several surface mines  including several newly permitted surface mines that are expected to have low overburden ratios and less trucking required 
expenses were further impacted by the continuation of employee medical cost inflation  including workers compensation costs and higher bonding and insurance costs 
in response to the higher medical costs  in the company implemented a new employee medical plan that it anticipates will significantly mitigate the effects of medical cost inflation in freight and handling costs decreased million  or percent  to million for compared with million for  due to a decrease in tons sold over the comparable periods and fewer shipments to customers where freight and handling costs are paid by the company 
cost of purchased coal revenue decreased million to million for from million for  due to the decrease in purchased tons sold 
depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased by percent to million in compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to a million pre tax write off of mine development costs at certain idled mines in see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impairment charges 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for compared to million for professional fees and corporate bonus accruals were less in compared to  while long term executive compensation expense increased due to the increase in massey s stock price during other expense  which consists of costs associated with the generation of other revenue  such as costs to operate the coal handling facilities  gas wells  and other miscellaneous expenses  decreased million from million for to million for interest interest expense increased to million for compared with million for the increase was primarily due to a higher weighted average interest rate on our variable rate borrowings and higher levels of debt outstanding in compared to in addition  as the company realigned its debt in the fourth quarter of to obtain longer maturities and favorable longer term rates  million of deferred financing costs related to the cancellation of its bank debt arranged in the third quarter of were written off

massey frequently evaluates potential acquisitions 
in the past  massey has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations  but massey may consider a variety of other sources  depending on the size of any transaction  including debt or equity financing

coal purchase obligations represent commitments to purchase coal from external production sources under firm contracts as of december  coal lease obligations includes minimum royalties paid on leased coal rights 
certain coal leases do not have set expiration dates but extend until completion of mining of all merchantable and mineable coal reserves 
for purposes of this table  the company has generally assumed that minimum royalties on such leases will be paid for a period of years 
other purchase obligations primarily include capital expenditure commitments for surface mining and other equipment as well as purchases of materials and supplies 
the company has purchase agreements with vendors for most types of operating expenses 
however  the company s open purchase orders which are not recognized as a liability until the purchased items are received under these purchase agreements  combined with any other open purchase orders  are not material and are excluded from this table 
other purchase obligations also includes contractual commitments under transportation contracts 
since the actual tons to be shipped under these contracts are not set and will vary  the amount included in the table reflects the minimum payment obligations required by the contracts 

table of contents additionally  the company has liabilities relating to pension and other postretirement benefits  work related injuries and illnesses  and mine reclamation and closure 
as of december   payments related to these items are estimated to be payments due by years in thousands within year years years the company s determination of these noncurrent liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from year to year 
in any year  if the company s assumptions are inaccurate  the company could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
moreover  in particular for periods after  the company s estimates may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if its assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 
these assumptions are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation section 
certain trends and uncertainties inability to satisfy contractual obligations may adversely affect massey s profitability from time to time  massey has disputes with customers over the provisions of long term contracts relating to  among other things  coal quality  pricing  quantity and delays in delivery 
in addition  massey may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to meet customer commitments to meet their demand 
massey s inability to satisfy its contractual obligations could result in the company purchasing coal from third party sources to satisfy those obligations or may result in customers initiating claims against massey 
the company may not be able to resolve all of these disputes in a satisfactory manner  which could result in substantial damages or otherwise harm its relationships with customers 
massey is subject to being adversely affected by a decline in the financial condition and creditworthiness of the companies with which it does business massey has contracts to supply coal to energy trading and brokering companies pursuant to which those companies sell such coal to the ultimate users 
massey is subject to being adversely affected by any decline in the financial condition and creditworthiness of these energy trading and brokering companies 
as the largest supplier of metallurgical coal to the american steel industry  massey is subject to being adversely affected by any decline in the financial condition or production volume of american steel producers 
see item  business  under the heading customers and coal contracts for further discussion 
massey is subject to being adversely affected by the potential inability to renew or obtain surety bonds federal and state laws require bonds to secure the company s obligations to reclaim lands used for mining  to pay federal and state workers compensation  and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations 
these bonds are typically renewable annually 
surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals 
the company s failure to maintain  or inability to acquire  surety bonds that are required by state and federal law would have a material impact on the company 
that failure could result from a variety of factors including the following lack of availability  higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new bonds  restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of the company s senior notes or revolving credit facilities  and 
table of contents the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety 
government regulations increase massey s costs and may discourage customers from burning coal massey incurs substantial costs and liabilities under increasingly strict federal  state and local environmental  health and safety and endangered species laws  including regulations and governmental enforcement policies 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens  the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations  the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from the company s operations 
it may also incur costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from its operations 
see item  business  under the headings environmental  safety and health laws and regulations for further discussion 
new legislation and new regulations may be adopted which could materially adversely affect massey s mining operations  cost structure or its customers ability to use coal 
new legislation and new regulations may also require massey or its customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs 
the epa has undertaken broad initiatives aimed at increasing compliance with emissions standards and to provide incentives to customers for decreasing emissions  often by switching to an alternative fuel source 
coal mining is subject to inherent risks massey s operations are subject to certain events and conditions that could disrupt operations  including fires and explosions from methane  accidental minewater discharges  natural disasters  equipment failures  maintenance problems and flooding 
massey maintains insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some  but not all  of these risks 
even where insurance coverage applies  there can be no assurance that these risks would be fully covered by massey s insurance policies 
transportation disruptions could impair massey s ability to sell coal massey s transportation providers are important in order to provide access to markets 
disruption of transportation services because of weather related problems  strikes  lockouts or other events could temporarily impair massey s ability to supply coal to customers 
the state of west virginia recently enacted legislation raising coal truck weight limits  including provisions supporting enhanced enforcement 
although massey has historically avoided public road trucking of coal  when possible  by transporting coal by rail  barge and conveyor systems  such stepped up enforcement actions could result in shipment delays and increased costs 
certain of massey s subsidiaries and other coal and transportation companies have been named as defendants in a lawsuit alleging that the defendants illegally transport coal in overloaded trucks causing damage to state roads and interfering with the plaintiffs use and enjoyment of their properties and their right to use the public roads  and seeking injunctive relief and damages 
see item  legal proceedings for further discussion of this litigation 
fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the demand for massey s coal transportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and  as a result  the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customer s purchasing decision 
increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy 
such increases could have a material impact on massey s ability to compete with other energy sources and on its cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
on the other hand  significant decreases in transportation costs could result in increased competition from coal producers in other parts of the country 
for instance  coal mines in the western us could become an attractive source of coal to consumers in the eastern part of the country if the costs of transporting coal from the west were significantly reduced 

table of contents foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of massey s coal abroad massey relies on customers in other countries for a portion of its sales  with shipments to countries in europe  north america  south america and asia 
massey competes in these international markets against coal produced in other countries 
coal is sold internationally in us dollars 
as a result  mining costs in competing producing countries may be reduced in us dollar terms based on currency exchange rates  providing an advantage to foreign coal producers 
currency fluctuations in producing countries could adversely affect the competitiveness of us coal in international markets 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company is a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees  operating leases  indemnifications  and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheets  and  except for the operating leases  the company does not expect any material impact on its cash flows  results of operations or financial condition to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
the company uses surety bonds to secure reclamation  workers compensation  wage payments  and other miscellaneous obligations 
as of december   the company had million of outstanding surety bonds with third parties 
these bonds were in place to secure obligations as follows post mining reclamation bonds of million  workers compensation bonds of million  wage payment and collection bonds of million  and other miscellaneous obligation bonds of million 
recently  surety bond costs have increased  while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable 
to the extent that surety bonds become unavailable  the company would seek to secure obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits  or other suitable forms of collateral 
as of december   the company had secured million of surety obligations with letters of credit 
from time to time the company uses bank letters of credit to secure its obligations for worker s compensation programs  various insurance contracts and other obligations 
at december   the company had million of letters of credit outstanding including the million noted above that secure surety obligations collateralized by million of cash deposited in restricted  interest bearing accounts pledged to issuing banks 
no claims were outstanding against those letters of credit as of december  in january  concurrent with the closing of the asset based revolving credit facility  million of the previously cash collateralized letters of credit were rolled under the new credit facility  resulting in the return of million of cash collateral to the company 
inflation inflation in the us has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on massey s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition for the years presented 
outlook the combination of high natural gas prices  an improving us economy  strong economic growth in china  the weak us dollar  higher ocean freight rates and limited coal supply from central appalachia has contributed to marked improvement in the coal industry environment 
demand for steam and metallurgical grade coals in both the domestic and export markets is expected to be strong in and support rising coal prices 
while massey s production is largely sold  the higher market prices should enable term contracts to be negotiated at higher levels for future years and as existing contracts expire 
the company expects produced coal sales of to million tons in however  it projects a first quarter loss due to weather related operational and shipping issues and the fact that all four of its longwall mines are projected to move to new panels in the quarter 

table of contents critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions were used in the preparation of the financial statements defined benefit pension the estimated cost and benefits of the company s non contributory defined benefit pension plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  with the company s review and approval  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  future rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
in estimating the discount rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the discount rate used to determine the obligation was compared to the discount rate used at december  of 
a decrease in the assumed discount rate increases the defined pension benefit expense 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is determined based upon the company s long term plans for such increases 
the rate of increase in compensation levels used was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on long term historical return information and future estimates of long term investment returns for the target asset allocation of investments that comprise plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to determine expense in each period was  and for the years ended december   december  and october   respectively 
significant changes to these rates introduce substantial volatility to the company s costs 
coal workers pneumoconiosis the company is responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  and various states statutes  for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
after review and approval by the company  an annual evaluation is prepared by the company s independent actuaries using various assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs trend  cost of living trend  mortality  death benefits  dependents and interest rates 
the company records expense related to this obligation using the service cost method 
at december   the discount rate used to determine the obligation was compared to at december  a decrease in the assumed discount rate increases black lung expense 
included in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements is a medical cost trend and cost of living trend sensitivity analysis 
workers compensation the company s operations have workers compensation coverage through a combination of either self insurance  participation in a state run program  or commercial insurance 
the company accrues for the self insured liability by recognizing cost when it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
to assist in the determination of this estimated liability the company utilizes the services of third party administrators who derive claim reserves from historical experience 
these third parties provide information to independent actuaries  who after review and consultation with the company with regards to actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  prepare an evaluation of the self insured liabilities 
at december   the discount rate used to determine liability was compared to at december  a decrease in the assumed discount rate increases the workers compensation self insured liability and related expense 
actual experience could differ from these estimates  which could increase the company s costs 
other postretirement benefits the company s sponsored health care plans provide retiree health benefits to eligible union and non union retirees who have met certain age and service requirements 
depending on year of retirement  benefits may be 
table of contents subject to annual deductibles  coinsurance requirements  lifetime limits  and retiree contributions 
these plans are not funded 
costs are paid as incurred by participants 
the estimated cost and benefits of the company s retiree health care plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  with the company s input  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs and per capita costs 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the other postretirement benefit liabilities could be effectively settled as of the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the discount rate used to determine the obligation was compared to at december  a decrease in the assumed discount rate increases retiree medical expense 
at december  the company s assumptions of the company health care cost trend were projected at an annual rate of ranging down to by ranging down to by at december   and remaining level thereafter 
significant changes to these rates introduce substantial volatility to the company s costs 
included in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements is a sensitivity analysis on the health care trend rate assumption 
reclamation and mine closure obligations the smcra establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
the company s total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and its engineering estimates related to these requirements 
the company adopted statement effective january  statement requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value  which is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability and the expected period in which reclamation work will be performed is reviewed periodically by the company s management and engineers 
in estimating future cash flows  the company considered the estimated current cost of reclamation and applied inflation rates and a third party profit  as necessary 
the third party profit is an estimate of the approximate markup that would be charged by contractors for work performed on behalf of the company 
the discount rate is based on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flow  adjusted for our credit standing 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
contingencies the company is the subject of  or a party to  various suits and pending or threatened litigation involving governmental agencies or private interests 
the company has accrued the probable and reasonably estimable costs for the resolution of these claims based upon management s best estimate of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
unless otherwise noted  management does not believe that the outcome or timing of current legal or environmental matters will have a material impact on its cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
also  the company s operations are affected by federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental matters and other aspects of its business 
the impact  if any  of pending legislation or regulatory developments on future operations is not currently estimable 
see item  legal proceeding s and note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the company s contingencies 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
statement also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax 
table of contents planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of our valuation allowance  we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
the company has a reserve for taxes that may become payable as a result of audits in future periods with respect to previously filed tax returns included in deferred tax liabilities separate disclosure has not been made because the amount is not considered material 
it is the company s policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities 
the company establishes the reserves based upon management s assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences ie  tax depletion expense  etc  tax credits and interest expense applied to temporary difference adjustments 
the tax reserves are analyzed periodically at least annually and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserve 
the company is currently under audit from the internal revenue service the irs for the fiscal years ended october  and october  it is expected that the irs audit will be completed in and may provide a favorable adjustment to the tax reserve 
the company s federal income tax returns have been examined by the irs  or statutes of limitations have expired through coal reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves 
many of these uncertainties are beyond the company s control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about the company s reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by its staff 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from similar areas with similar conditions  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin and subsequently revised fin in december as revised  fin s consolidation provisions apply to interest in variable interest entities vies that are referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  for all other vies  fin s consolidation provisions apply for periods ending after march   or as of march  for the company 
the company does not have any interests in special purpose entities 
the company did not apply any of the fin consolidation provisions in the company is continuing to evaluate the effect of fin but does not expect that it will have a material impact 
on july   the company adopted the provision of sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity statement  which requires an issuer to classify and measure certain freestanding financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity as a liability if that financial instrument embodies an obligation requiring the issuer to redeem the financial instrument by transferring its assets 
the adoption of this provision of statement did not have a material impact on the company s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  statement contains a second provision that impacts the accounting for minority interests in limited life subsidiaries and requires that those interests be measured at settlement value 
the effective date of the second provision of 
table of contents statement has been deferred for an indefinite period 
the company does not expect the application of the second provision of statement to have a material impact on the company s cash flows  results of operation or financial condition 
other accounting developments historical practice in extractive industries has been to classify leased mineral rights as tangible assets  which is consistent with the balance sheet classification of mining properties owned in fee 
the company and others in extractive industries have historically taken the position that rights under such long term mineral leases are the functional equivalent of fee ownership of the underlying coal because the lessee has the exclusive right to extract the coal during the term of the lease and because the lessee owns the extracted coal in fee 
sfas no 
 business combinations statement  provides leased mineral rights as an example of a contract based intangible asset that should be considered for separate classification as the result of a business combination 
due to the potential for inconsistencies in applying the provisions of statement and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in the extractive industries as they relate to mineral interests controlled by other than fee ownership  the emerging issues task force the eitf of the financial accounting standards board has established a mining industry working group that is currently considering this issue 
the classification of our leased mineral rights in our consolidated balance sheet may be revised depending upon the conclusions reached by the mining industry working group and the eitf 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk massey s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of short term interest rates 
at december   the outstanding million aggregate principal amount of long term debt was under fixed rate instruments  however  the primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to an interest rate swap entered into on november   covering a notional amount of debt of million 
based on the notional amount outstanding of million  a hypothetical basis point increase in the specified swap interest rate index would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
the projected present value of the swap instrument is partially determined by movements in interest rates  and massey may be required to post cash deposits with the swap counterparty if the present value in favor of the counterparty exceeds certain threshold amounts based on massey s credit rating at the time 
if it should become necessary to borrow under the new asset based revolving credit facility  those borrowings would be also made at a variable rate 
the company manages its commodity price risk through the use of long term coal supply agreements  which are contracts with a term of months or greater  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
the company believes that the percentage of its sales pursuant to these long term contracts was approximately for its fiscal year ended december  the company anticipates that in  the percentage of sales pursuant to long term contracts will be comparable with the percentage of sales for the prices for coal shipped under long term contracts may be below the current market price for similar types of coal at any given time 
as a consequence of the substantial volume of its sales  which are subject to these long term agreements  the company has less coal available with which to capitalize on stronger coal prices if and when they arise 
in addition  because long term contracts typically allow the customer to elect volume flexibility  the company s ability to realize the higher prices that may be available in the spot market may be restricted when customers elect to purchase higher volumes under such contracts  or the company s exposure to market based pricing may be increased should customers elect to purchase fewer tons
