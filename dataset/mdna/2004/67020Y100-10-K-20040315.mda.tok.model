general we derive our revenue from sales of our software products to customers through distribution partners and value added resellers  royalty revenues from oem partners  license fees from sales of our products to customers and from professional services  which include  but are not limited to  custom software applications and other services considered essential to the functionality of the software  training  and maintenance associated with software license transactions 
our speech technologies enable voice activated services over a telephone  transform speech into text and text into speech  and permit voice control of devices and applications 
our digital capture technologies transform text  images and files into various digital formats 
during  speech and digital capture represented approximately and  respectively  of our net revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of material and fulfillment costs  third party royalties  salaries for product support personnel  and engineering costs associated with certain contracts which are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets consists of the amortization of acquired patents and core and completed technology 
research and development expense consists primarily of salary and benefits costs of engineers 
we believe that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are essential to our success 
accordingly  we plan to continue to invest in research and development activities 
to date  we have not capitalized any internal development costs as the cost incurred after technological feasibility but before release of product has not been significant 
selling expenses include salaries  commissions  advertising  direct mail  public relations  trade shows  travel and other related sales and marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for administration  finance  human resources  information systems and general management  in addition to legal and accounting expenses and other professional services 
we attempt to control selling  general and administrative expense  however  if revenue continues to grow  we expect selling  general and administrative expense to increase to support our growing operations 
in addition  we may increase selling  general and administrative expenses in advance of revenue to support expected future revenue growth in specific product lines or geographic regions 
stock based compensation expenses result from non cash charges for common shares issued with exercise or purchase prices that are less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets excludes amortization of acquired patents and core and completed technology which is included in cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  in particular those related to revenue recognition  including estimates of costs to complete the development of custom software applications and estimates of valuation allowances specifically sales returns and other allowances  the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  estimates used in the accounting for acquisitions  and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult and subjective judgments 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of our software products to customers through distribution partners and value added resellers  royalty revenues from oem partners  license fees from sales of our products to customers in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position  and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue from the sale of licenses to end users  value added resellers and system integrators to use our software products is recognized upon delivery  provided that the arrangement does not require significant modification or customization of the software  any services included in the arrangement are not considered essential to the functionality of the software  evidence of the arrangement exists  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales of our software products through certain distributors and value added resellers provide rights of return for as long as the distributors or resellers hold the inventory 
as a result  we recognize revenues from sales to these distributors and resellers only when the distributors or resellers have sold products to retailers and end users 
title and risk of loss pass to the distributor or reseller upon shipment  at which time the transaction is invoiced and payment is due 
based on reports from distributors and resellers of their inventory balances at the end of each period  we record an allowance against accounts receivable for the sales price of all inventories subject to return 
if we experience significant returns from distributors or resellers  our liquidity may be adversely impacted 
we also make an estimate of sales returns by retailers or end users directly or through our distributors or resellers based on historical returns experience 
the provision for these estimated returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time that the related revenue is recorded 
if actual returns from retailers differ significantly from our estimates  such differences could have a material impact on our results of operations for the period in which the actual returns become known 
our accounts receivable balance  including accounts receivable from a related party  was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
these balances are net of sales returns and other allowances of million and million and allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
revenue from royalties on sales of our products by oems to third parties  where no services are included  is typically recognized upon delivery to the third party when such information is available  or when we are notified by the oem that such royalties are due as a result of a sale  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
when we provide professional services such as custom application development or other services considered essential to the functionality of the software for a fixed fee  we recognize revenue from the fees for such services and any related software licenses as we complete the project using the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain performance type contracts 
we generally determine the percentage of completion by comparing the labor hours we have incurred to date to the estimate of the total labor hours required to complete the project based on regular discussions with our project managers 
this method is used because we consider expended labor hours to be the most reliable available measure of progress on these projects 
adjustments to contract estimates are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known 
when the estimate indicates a loss  such loss is recorded in the period identified 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining total estimated costs  and therefore the percent complete of each contract 
if our estimates change  the adjustment could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period of the change 
other professional services not considered essential to the functionality of the software are limited and primarily include training and feasibility studies 
when we provide these services on a time and materials basis  we recognize revenue as we perform the services based on actual time incurred 
when we provide software support and maintenance services  we recognize the revenue ratably over the term of the related contracts  typically one year 
we may sell  under one contract or related contracts  software licenses  custom software applications and other services considered essential to the functionality of the software and a maintenance and support arrangement 
the total contract value is attributed first to the maintenance and support arrangement based vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of its fair value  equal to its stated list price as a fixed percentage of the related software product s price 
the remainder of the total contract value is then attributed to the software license and related professional services  which are typically recognized as revenue using the percentage of completion method 
as a result  discounts inherent in the total contract value are attributed to the software license and related professional services 
we may sell  under one contract or related contracts  software licenses  a maintenance and support arrangement and professional services not considered essential to the functionality of the software 
in those arrangements  the total contract value is attributed first to the undelivered elements of maintenance and support and professional services based on their fair values  as described above 
the remainder of the contract value is attributed to the software licenses  which are typically recognized as revenue upon delivery  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
as a result  discounts inherent in the total contract value are attributed to the software licenses 
we follow the guidance of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products eitf  in determining whether consideration  given to a customer should be recorded as an operating expense or a reduction of revenue recognized from that same customer 
consideration given to a customer is recorded as a reduction of revenue unless both of the following conditions are met we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration  and the identified benefit is sufficiently separable from the customer s purchase of our products and services such that we could have purchased the products from a third party  and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
if both of the conditions are met  we record consideration paid to customers as an expense 
consideration  including equity instruments  not meeting the above criteria  is recorded as a reduction of revenue  to the extent we have recorded cumulative revenue from the customer or reseller 
as a result of this policy  we recorded a million  million and million reduction in total revenue and a corresponding reduction of selling  general and administrative expense for the years ended  and respectively 
we record reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses as revenue  with offsetting costs recorded as cost of revenue 
out of pocket expenses generally include  but are not limited to  expenses related to airfare  hotel stays and out of town meals 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we have significant long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the most significant long lived tangible and intangible assets are fixed assets  patents and core technology  completed technology and trademarks which are typically amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the values of intangible assets  with the exception of goodwill  were initially determined by a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
we assess the potential impairment of identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and at least annually 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment of such assets  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets or sfas sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
the standard also includes provisions for the assessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangible assets and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
we have assessed the useful lives of our existing intangible assets  other than goodwill  and believe that estimated useful lives remain appropriate 
in addition  we have determined that we operate in one reporting unit 
as a result  we use the stock price of our common stock to determine fair value for our initial impairment test 
based on this  we performed the annual assessment during the fourth quarter of and determined that goodwill was not impaired  therefore no impairment charge was recorded 
we complete goodwill impairment analyses at least annually  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill might be impaired 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the useful lives of our intangible assets  determining what reporting units exist and assessing when events or circumstances would require an interim impairment analysis of goodwill or other long lived assets to be performed 
changes in events or circumstances  including but not limited to technological advances or competition which could result in shorter useful lives  additional reporting units which may require alternative methods of estimating fair value  or economic or market conditions which may affect previous assumptions and estimates  could have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position through accelerated amortization expense or impairment charges 
accounting for acquisitions we have completed multiple significant business and other asset acquisitions over the proceeding five years which have resulted in significant goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
our future business strategy contemplates that we may continue to pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
our accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates primarily  but not limited to the fair value of certain forms of consideration  the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which involve projections of future revenues and cash flows  the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies  and the useful lives and  as applicable  the reporting unit  of the assets 
the impact of prior or future acquisitions on our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates 
additionally  under sfas  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit  for purposes of the first step in our annual goodwill impairment test  based on our stock price 
if prior or future acquisitions are not accretive to our results of operations as expected  or our stock price declines dramatically  we may be required to complete the second step which requires significant judgments and estimates and which may result in material impairment charges in the period in which they are determined 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction 
there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions 
the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
a portion of our deferred tax liabilities relate to taxable temporary differences for which the period in which the differences will reverse is indefinite 
such deferred tax liabilities cannot offset our deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowance 
as a result  our income tax provision includes a deferred tax provision to increase the valuation allowance by a corresponding amount 
through december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions due to the uncertainty of their realization as a result of cumulative historical losses 
if the realization of net deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  a reduction in the valuation allowance would materially increase net income in the period such determination is made 
results of operations december  compared to december  total revenue total revenue for increased by million or compared to the growth in revenue is attributed to a million growth in our speech revenues  offset by an overall decrease of million in our digital capture revenues from revenue from our speech products was million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in our speech revenues are primarily related to a million increase in our networked speech technologies  a million increase in our embedded speech technologies  as well as a million increase in our dictation product lines  from the year the million overall decrease in our digital capture products can be attributed to a million decrease in revenues recognized from our ocr products 
this overall decrease is due  in part  to the fact that omnipage pro was launched earlier in than omnipage pro was launched in  as well as the recognition in of revenue previously deferred 
the decrease in the ocr revenues was offset to some extent by an overall strengthening of our other digital capture product lines  in particular  paperport and the revenues derived from the launch of our new product  pdf converter  during the fourth quarter of related party revenue increased million or compared to this increase was related to the inclusion of our products in expanded product offerings of our related parties  primarily xerox 
revenue for the year ended december  was north america and international versus north america and international  respectively for geographic revenue classification is based on the country in which the sale is invoiced 
a number of our oem partners distribute their products throughout the world and do not provide us with the geographical dispersion of their products 
we believe  if provided with this information  our geographical revenue classification would indicate a higher international percentage 
based on an estimate that factors our oem partners geographical revenue mix to our revenues generated from these oem partners  revenue for the year ended december  is approximately north america and international  compared to north america and international  for the comparable period in the increase in our international revenue  as a percentage of total revenue  is driven primarily from europe 
the increase is the result of increased sales and marketing resources  the addition of resellers  the release of dragon naturally speaking  increased demand from oems for our realspeak product tts  the continued growth of paperport in the international market space  as well as revenues achieved from our acquisitions of the philips and speechworks technologies 
the following table presents the breakdown of our revenue by distribution channel year ended december  var retail direct oem the increase in our oem revenues and the corresponding decrease in our other sales channels  as a percentage of revenue  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period  was primarily due to the acquisitions of the philips and speechworks technologies as both businesses were more focused in the oem markets than in the retail or var channel 
for fiscal year  we expect revenue growth of to from the fiscal year total 
we believe that growth will occur throughout all of our product lines 
within the networked speech market  our anticipated growth is attributable to certain competitive advantages  such as superior products  channel expertise  packaged applications and professional services 
by leveraging our advantages  we expect to gain additional share in the financial services  healthcare  utilities  government  and travel and entertainment markets 
within the embedded speech market  we anticipate continued growth  specifically in the automotive  electronic games and handsets markets  resulting in a significant increase over revenues 
additionally  we intend to extend our solutions further in the learning and accessibility markets 
within our productivity applications  we expect to benefit from three important trends it spending in healthcare  networked scanning  and pdf solutions 
we expect to invest in and see growth from opportunities in healthcare organizations looking for productivity solutions that can automate processes  cut costs  and offer an alternative to outsourcing with the use of our dictation applications 
in digital capture  our omnipage and paperport products are positioned to take advantage of the growing networked scanning markets through our major oem partners 
within the pdf market  we have seen early success from our pdf converter line  and expect to see growth as we continue to invest in pdf solutions 
cost of revenue cost of revenue for was million or of total revenue  compared to million or of total revenue for the increase in cost of revenue in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue for is attributable to an increase in engineering costs related to professional services revenue resulting from the philips and speechworks acquisitions and increased technical support costs primarily related to the creation of a customer service department in europe 
the company anticipates annualized cost savings in cost of revenue of approximately million  relating to restructuring actions taken in connection with the speechworks acquisition 
these savings are partially offset by increased staffing of our professional services organization in response to an increase in demand 
as a result  we expect gross margins will decline in due to an increase in professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
cost of revenue from stock based compensation is related to the issuance of common stock to certain company executives with exercise or purchase prices that were less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets for was million or of total revenue compared to million or of total revenue for the increase in cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets in absolute dollars is attributable to million of amortization related to the exclusive worldwide license of certain desktop dictation products and technologies  million related to the philips acquisition which was completed on january  and million related to the speechworks acquisition which was completed on august   partially offset by million of intangible assets that became fully amortized during fiscal year during  we expect cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets to be approximately million based on the related assets and estimated useful lives at december  research and development expense research and development costs for were million or of total revenue  compared to million or of total revenue for the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars is due to increased speech and language development efforts associated with increased headcount and related costs of approximately million resulting from both the philips and speechworks acquisitions 
this increase is partially offset by a reduction of headcount and related costs of approximately million resulting from the transfer of certain research and development activities from our corporate headquarters to budapest during the three month period ended june  the company will continue to invest significantly in research and development  but we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue to decline in due to an expected increase in revenue and the continued realization of operational synergies 
the company anticipates annualized cost savings in research and development of approximately million related to restructuring actions in connection with the speechworks acquisition  completed in selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense for was million or of total revenue  compared to million or for the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue for was the result of increased compensation costs of approximately million resulting from the addition of sales and marketing employees and general and administrative employees primarily due to the philips and speechworks acquisitions 
the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for is due primarily to increased facilities charges of million resulting from increased rent and related insurance expenses  increased advertising expenses of million  increased channel marketing expenses of million  increased professional fees of approximately million and increased bad debt expense of million 
the company expects selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to increase initially in  as it maintains marketing programs that proved successful towards the end of  but to decline as a percentage of revenue over the remainder of as revenue increases 
in addition  during  the company expects to incur approximately million related to compliance with recently issued regulatory requirements 
selling  general and administrative expenses from stock based compensation of approximately million is related to the issuance of common stock to certain company executives with exercise or purchase prices that are less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
the company anticipates annualized cost savings in selling  general and administrative of approximately million related to restructuring actions in connection with the speechworks acquisition completed in amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets for was million or of total revenue compared to million or of total revenue for the increase in amortization of other intangible assets is attributable to million related to the philips acquisition  which was completed on january   and million related to the speechworks acquisition  which was completed on august   partially offset by million of intangible assets that became fully amortized during fiscal year during  we expect amortization of other intangible assets to be approximately million  based on the related assets and estimated useful lives at december  restructuring and other charges  net restructuring and other charges for were million compared to million for these charges in reflect million related to the elimination of employees as a result of the philips and speechworks acquisitions 
also included are million and million of employee and facility related costs  respectively  associated with the restructuring of various other corporate activities during the year 
the company anticipates annualized cost savings of approximately million related to restructuring actions in connection with the speechworks acquisition completed in income loss from operations as a result of the above factors  loss from operations was million for compared with income of million for other income expense  net interest income was million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in interest income from to was a result of higher cash and cash equivalent balances  which grew from million at december  to million at december  interest expense was million and million for and  respectively 
interest expense consists primarily of interest related to the million euro note related to the philips acquisition and imputed interest expense related to the exclusive license acquired to resell certain productivity applications 
other income in consists primarily of foreign exchange gains of million  partially offset by other expenses of million 
foreign exchange losses were insignificant in income loss before income taxes loss before income taxes was million for  compared with income of million for income taxes the benefit for income taxes of million for primarily consisted of a benefit of million relating to a federal tax refund  relating to the carryback of net operating losses to a prior period offset by a million deferred tax provision associated with differences between the book and tax amortization of certain goodwill  of which million relates to the provision for income taxes of million for consisted of foreign and state tax provisions of million offset by the federal tax benefit of million  related to a refund of taxes paid by caere corporation prior to its acquisition by scansoft 
in  the company s effective tax rate was a benefit of versus a provision of in the variance from the statutory rate for was due primarily to a federal refund received relating to caere corporation for taxes paid prior to its acquisition by scansoft  offset by increases in the valuation allowance 
at december   scansoft had net deferred tax assets of million which were subject to consideration of a valuation allowance 
a full valuation allowance has been provided against the net deferred tax assets in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions due to the uncertainty of their realization as a result of cumulative historical losses 
in the future  a period of sustained profitability will cause us to reassess the need for the valuation allowance 
we may be required to recognize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the valuation allowance which would result in a material benefit to our results of operations in the period in which the benefit is determined 
net income loss as a result of all these factors  net loss totaled million for  compared with net income of million for december  compared to december  total revenue total revenue for increased by million or compared to the growth in revenue for the year ended december  was primarily the result of revenue generated from our speech products 
revenue from our speech products was million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in speech revenue was due to the l h acquisition  which occurred in december revenue from our digital capture products was million and million for and  respectively 
the net increase of million in revenue from our digital capture products from was due primarily to an increase of million in sales of digital capture products through the channel network  partially offset by a decrease in revenue of million from xerox  a related party  due to the cancellation of its retail multi function product line in late geographic revenue classification is based on the country in which the sale is invoiced 
revenue for was north america and international  versus north america and international for a number of our oem partners distribute their products throughout the world and do not provide us with the geographical dispersion of their products 
we believe that  if we were provided with this information  our geographical revenue classification would indicate a higher international percentage 
based on an estimate that factors our oem partners geographical revenue mix to our revenues generated from these oem partners  revenue for was approximately north america and international versus north america and international for the increase in our international revenue percentage for was driven primarily from europe and asia and was the result of increased sales and marketing efforts and additional resellers 
the following table presents the breakdown of our total revenue by distribution channel year ended december  var retail direct oem the increase in oem  and the corresponding decrease in var retail  as a percent of revenue  for as compared to was due to the addition of speech products in oems represent a higher percentage of revenue for our speech products than for our digital capture products 
effective january   we implemented eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
the implementation resulted in a million reduction to total revenue and a corresponding reduction of selling  general and administrative expense for additionally  it resulted in the reclassification of million from selling  general and administrative expense to net revenue for cost of revenue cost of revenue for was million or of revenue  compared to million or for the increase in cost of revenue in absolute dollars for was directly attributable to the increase in the volume of product sales to var retail customers as well as increased embedded text to speech revenue which bears a higher cost of revenue than our traditional software products 
the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue for  as compared to  was due to lower supply chain logistics and fulfillment costs  partially offset by the higher cost of embedded text to speech revenue 
cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets for was million compared to million for the decrease in cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets of million was due to million of intangible assets that became fully amortized in the first quarter of this reduction was partially offset by million of amortization recorded for the acquired l h and audiomining assets 
research and development expense research and development costs for were million or of total revenue  compared to million or of total revenue for the increase in research and development expenses of million for was primarily the result of increased headcount of employees associated with the l h acquisition 
cost savings attributable to the restructuring actions taken in for were approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense for was million or of total revenue  compared to million or for the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars for was primarily the result of increased headcount costs of million resulting from the addition of employees  primarily in sales and marketing  as well as million of increased marketing programs in support of the higher revenue 
these increases were largely attributable to the l h acquisition and our expanded focus on international sales and marketing 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for was million compared to million for the decrease in amortization expense is directly attributable to the adoption of sfas  as a result of which we ceased the amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce of approximately million per quarter 
additionally  amortization expense decreased million in  due to intangible assets that became fully amortized in the first quarter of this reduction was partially offset by additional amortization of approximately million for from the l h and audiomining acquisitions 
restructuring and other charges  net in january  we announced  and in march completed  a restructuring plan to consolidate facilities  worldwide sales organizations  research and development teams and other personnel following the l h acquisition on december  as a result  we exited certain facilities in both north america and europe  eliminating employee positions  including in research and development and in selling  general and administrative functions 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge in the amount of million for severance payments to these employees and a charge of million for certain termination fees to be incurred as a result of exiting the facilities  including the write off of previously recorded assembled workforce of million 
during  the company paid a total of million in severance payments  of which million related to the march restructuring and million related to severance paid to the former caere president and ceo  pursuant to a restructuring 
at december   the remaining restructuring accrual from the current and prior restructuring activities amounted to million 
this balance is comprised of million of lease exit costs resulting from the restructuring and million of severance to the former caere president and ceo 
the lease exit costs and severance due to the former caere president and ceo will be paid through january and march  respectively 
income loss from operations as a result of the above factors  income from operations was million for compared with a loss of million for other income expense  net interest income was million and million for and  respectively

the increase in accounts receivable of million at december   as compared to december   was the result of receivables added in connection with acquisitions completed during the year as well as a significant increase in overall revenue for the year ended december  historically  we have not incurred any significant losses on our accounts receivable balances 
net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended december  was million compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the comparable period in net cash provided by investing activities during the period consisted of million acquired in the speechworks acquisition  million received from philips in accordance with provisions in the purchase agreement and million due to the maturity of marketable securities  partially offset by million in capital expenditures  million of payments associated with acquisitions and million of payments associated with an exclusive licensing agreement

this was partially offset by proceeds of million from an underwritten offering of our common stock in the first quarter of and proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock in connection with employee stock compensation plans 
net cash used in financing activities during consisted of proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock in connection with employee stock compensation plans and net proceeds of million from a private placement of our common stock 
this was offset by a million payment on a capital lease obligation  a million payment to repurchase shares of our common stock held by l h  million in payments of notes payable related to prior acquisitions and a million payment to the former caere president and ceo in connection with the settlement of a non competition and consulting agreement 
in addition  prior to december   in accordance with provisions of the purchase agreement  we agreed with philips upon a purchase price adjustment resulting in a decrease to the total purchase consideration 
philips is to pay us approximately million 
as of december   the balance was classified as an other current asset 
we received this payment on january  on october   we entered into a two year loan and security agreement as amended  the loan agreement with silicon valley bank the bank that consisted of a million revolving loan the credit facility 
we amended this loan and security agreement  as of september   for the period september  through december   removing the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and replacing it with an adjusted quick ratio covenant 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus or  at december  which is determined by our adjusted quick ratio  as defined in the loan agreement 
the maximum aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any one time is limited to the lesser of million or a borrowing base equal to either or of eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the loan agreement  based on our adjusted quick ratio 
borrowings under the loan agreement cannot exceed the borrowing base and must be repaid in the event they exceed the calculated borrowing base or upon expiration of the two year loan term 
borrowings under the loan agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our personal property  predominantly our accounts receivable  but not our intellectual property 
we are currently renegotiating the terms of our loan and security agreement 
until these negotiations are complete  we continue to have access to the existing million revolving loan 
during this time the credit facility will be subject to the terms as amended on september  as of december   based upon the calculated borrowing base  available borrowings totaled approximately million  as we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit 
in connection with the speechworks acquisition  we eliminated former speechworks employees 
in connection with this action  a liability of million  representing severance and related benefits  has been included in the purchase price allocation 
as of december   the remaining restructuring accrual related to speechworks acquisition amounted to million 
for the twelve months ended december   we paid a total of million in severance payments  of which million relates to the march restructuring and million relates to severance paid to the former caere president and ceo  pursuant to a restructuring charge 
at december   the remaining restructuring accrual from the current and prior restructuring activities amounted to million 
the balance is comprised of million of lease exit costs and million of employee related severance costs  of which million are for severance to the former caere president and ceo  million are for severance costs related to the philips related restructuring actions and million is for severance costs related to actions taken during  respectively 
the lease exit costs and severance due to the former caere president and ceo will be paid through january and march  respectively 
severance costs related to restructuring actions undertaken during will be paid through march in september of  we repurchased  shares of common stock from l h and certain other parties at per share for a total consideration of million 
we also agreed to register l h s remaining holdings of our common stock in an underwritten public offering 
our agreement to register these shares for l h contained provisions requiring us to issue additional shares to l h if the registration was not completed by certain deadlines 
because we did not meet one of those deadlines  on december   we issued  shares to lernout hauspie speech products nv and  shares to l h holdings usa  inc additionally  since we did not complete the underwritten public offering by january   all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the million promissory note  dated december   that we issued in connection with the l h acquisition became immediately due and payable 
to fulfill this obligation  on january   we paid million in full settlement of all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest under this note 
the underwritten offering of the l h shares was completed on february  and no further payments or issuances are due to l h 
as part of the underwritten offering completed for l h  we sold  shares and raised approximately million in gross proceeds 
after considering offering costs  the estimated net proceeds equaled approximately million 
on march   the company received approximately million of net proceeds from the exercise of the over allotment option of  shares granted to the underwriters as part of the underwritten offering 
although we generated million of cash from operations for and exited the year with a cash balance of million  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to generate cash from operations or secure additional equity or debt financing if required 
the large increase in our cash balance has come primarily from the speechworks acquisition 
in connection with the philips speech processing telephony and voice control business unit acquisition we issued a million  zero interest convertible debenture due january additionally  in connection with the speechworks acquisition we acquired certain long term lease obligations that begin to come due in the next months 
we have sustained recurring losses from operations in each reporting period through december  we have reported a net loss of million and net income of million for the fiscal year ended december  and  respectively 
we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  we believe that the actions taken in connection with our acquisitions  including restructuring actions and other cost reduction initiatives  have reduced operating expenses to levels which  in combination with expected future revenues  will continue to generate positive cash flow 
therefore  we believe that cash flows from future operations in addition to cash on hand and amounts available under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet the our working capital  investing  financing and contractual obligations  including the debt obligation issued in connection with the philips acquisition  and the lease obligations assumed in the speechworks acquisition  as they become due for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table outlines our contractual payment obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual less than more than obligations total year years years years in thousands convertible debenture   deferred payments for technology license    operating leases      caere acquisition related costs equipment line of credit  standby letters of credit   royalty commitments  purchase commitments imputed interest total contractual cash obligations      at december   the company has sub leased certain office space to third parties 
total sub lease income under contractual terms is million  which has not been reflected in the above operating lease contractual obligations  will be received through february off balance sheet arrangements through december   we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
foreign operations because we have international subsidiaries and distributors that operate and sell our products outside the united states  we are exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 
in certain circumstances  we have entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany balances with our foreign subsidiaries 
we use these contracts to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as the gains or losses on these contracts are intended to offset any exchange rate losses or gains on the hedged transaction 
we do not engage in foreign currency speculation 
hedges are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge and are evaluated for effectiveness monthly 
forward exchange contracts hedging firm commitments qualify for hedge accounting when they are designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure and they are effective in minimizing such exposure 
in connection with the philips acquisition on january   we entered into a forward hedge in the amount of million to meet our obligation to pay the million euro promissory note philips note issued as part of the acquisition 
on august   we entered into a forward exchange contract to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the million euro note payable to philips 
as both the million euro promissory note and million euro note payable to philips were paid prior to december   the related forward exchange contracts have expired 
as a result of hedge effectiveness no significant gain or loss was incurred upon expiration of the contracts 
on november   we entered into a forward exchange contract to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to million euros of intercompany receivables from our belgian subsidiary 
the contract has a one year term that expires on november  for the year ended  we recorded a net exchange rate gain of approximately  in other comprehensive income on the intercompany receivable and associated forward exchange contract 
on november   we entered into a forward exchange contract to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to million singapore dollars of intercompany receivables from our singapore subsidiary 
the contract expired on january  for the year ended  we recorded a net exchange rate loss of approximately  in other comprehensive income on the intercompany receivable and associated forward exchange contract 
with our increased international presence in a number of geographic locations and with international revenues projected to increase in  we are exposed to changes in foreign currencies including the euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen and the hungarian forint 
changes in the value of the euro or other foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar could adversely affect future revenues and operating results

fin clarifies the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
fin covers guarantee contracts that have any of the following four characteristics a contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset  a liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party eg  financial and market value guarantees  b contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity s failure to perform under an obligating agreement performance guarantees  c indemnification agreements that contingently require the indemnifying party guarantor to make payments to the indemnified party guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset  a liability  or an equity security of the indemnified party  such as an adverse judgment in a lawsuit or the imposition of additional taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law  and d indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
fin specifically excludes certain guarantee contracts from its scope 
additionally  certain guarantees are not subject to fin s provisions for initial recognition and measurement but are subject to its disclosure requirements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions are effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  we have evaluated the impact of fin on our financial statements and determined that the recognition provision did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations for in june  the fasb issued sfas no

eitf allowed for an exit cost liability to be recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also requires that liabilities recorded in connection with exit plans be initially measured at fair value 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early adoption encouraged 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors we operate in an intensely competitive environment and our operations are subject to risks and uncertainties 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the loss of  or a significant curtailment of  purchases by any one or more of our principal customers  the cyclical nature of the retail software industry  the inability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property  the inability to attract or retain skilled employees  technological obsolescence of current products and the inability to develop new products  the inability to respond to competitive technology and competitive pricing pressures  and the ability to sustain product revenues upon the introduction of new products 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and differ materially from one quarter to the next  which could have an impact on our stock price 
there can be no assurance that any cash generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  and we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities  or obtain additional lines of credit 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
it may be difficult to sell additional equity or obtain debt financing  and this could result in significant constraints on our ability to grow revenue and develop new products 
you should also carefully consider the additional risks described below when evaluating our company 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial situation 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed by any of these risks 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 
if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our share price may decrease significantly 
our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future 
if this occurs  the price of our stock would likely decline 
factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include the following slowing sales by our distribution and fulfillment partners to their customers  which may place pressure on these partners to reduce purchases of our products  volume  timing and fulfillment of customer orders  customers delaying their purchase decisions in anticipation of new versions of products  introduction of new products by us or our competitors  seasonality  reduction in the prices of our products in response to competition or market conditions  returns and allowance charges in excess of recorded amounts  timing of significant marketing and sales promotions  increased expenditures incurred pursuing new product or market opportunities  inability to adjust our operating expenses to compensate for shortfalls in revenue against forecast  demand for products  and general economic trends as they affect retail and corporate sales 
due to the foregoing factors  among others  our revenue and operating results are difficult to forecast 
our expense levels are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenue 
therefore  our failure to meet revenue expectations would seriously harm our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
further  an unanticipated decline in revenue for a particular quarter may disproportionately affect our profitability because a relatively small amount of our expenses are intended to vary with our revenue in the short term 
we have a history of losses 
we may incur losses in the future 
we sustained recurring losses from operations in each reporting period through december  we reported a net loss of million and net income of million for the fiscal year ended december  and  respectively 
we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  if we are unable to regain profitability  the market price for our stock may decline  perhaps substantially 
our business could be harmed if we do not successfully manage the integration of the businesses that we acquire  including our recently completed acquisition of locusdialog 
as part of our business strategy  we have in the past acquired  and expect to continue to acquire  other businesses and technologies 
our acquisition of the speech and language technology operations of lernout hauspie speech products nv and certain of its affiliates  including l h holdings usa  inc collectively  l h  our acquisition of the speech processing telephony and voice control business units from philips and our acquisition of speechworks international  inc  required substantial integration and management efforts 
our recently completed acquisition of locusdialog  inc  may pose similar challenges 
acquisitions of this nature involve a number of risks  including difficulty in transitioning and integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  including different and complex accounting and financial reporting systems  potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  potential difficulty in successfully implementing  upgrading and deploying in a timely and effective manner new operational information systems and upgrades of our finance  accounting and product distribution systems  difficulty in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and technology  unanticipated expenses and delays in completing acquired development projects and technology integration  management of geographically remote units both in the united states and internationally  impairment of relationships with partners and customers  entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited experience  and potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
as a result of these and other risks  we may not realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions 
any failure to achieve these benefits or failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies could seriously harm our business 
our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of purchase accounting treatment  and the corresponding impact of amortization of other intangibles relating to our acquisitions completed during under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we have accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
under purchase accounting  we have recorded the market value of our common stock or other form of consideration issued in connection with the acquisition and the amount of direct transaction costs as the cost of acquiring the company or business 
we have allocated that cost to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including various identifiable intangible assets such as acquired technology  acquired trade names and acquired customer relationships based on their respective fair values 
intangible assets generally will be amortized over a five to ten year period 
goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to at least an annual impairment analysis  which may result in an impairment charge if the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value 
as a result  purchase accounting treatment of these acquisitions could decrease our net income in the foreseeable future  which could have a material and adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
a large part of our revenue is dependent on continued demand for our products from oem partners 
a significant reduction in oem revenue would seriously harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and stock price 
many of our technologies are licensed to partners that incorporate our technologies into solutions that they sell to their customers 
the commercial success of these licensed products depends to a substantial degree on the efforts of these licensees in developing and marketing products incorporating our technologies 
the integration of our technologies into their products takes significant time  effort and investment  and products incorporating our technologies may not be successfully implemented or marketed by our licensees 
oem revenue represented and of our consolidated revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
a select few of our oem partners account for a majority of our oem revenues 
our partners are not required to continue to bundle or embed our software  and they may choose the software products of our competitors in addition to  or in place of  our products 
a significant reduction in oem revenue would seriously harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and our stock price 
speech technologies may not achieve widespread acceptance by businesses  which could limit our ability to grow our speech business 
the market for speech technologies is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
our ability to increase revenue in the future depends in large measure on acceptance of speech technologies in general and our products in particular 
the continued development of the market for our current and future speech solutions will also depend on the following factors widespread deployment and acceptance of speech technologies  consumer demand for speech enabled applications  development by third party vendors of applications using speech technologies  and continuous improvement in speech technology 
sales of our speech products would be harmed if the market for speech software does not continue to develop or develops more slowly than we expect  and  consequently  our business could be harmed 
we have grown and may continue to grow  through acquisitions  which may result in significant intangible assets  dilution of our existing stockholders  use of cash and other risks 
during  we purchased certain businesses and intellectual property from philips and completed the acquisitions of speechworks and locusdialog  inc we may acquire additional complementary assets  technologies or businesses in the future 
our past acquisitions have given rise to  and future acquisitions may result in  substantial levels of intangible assets that will be amortized or subject to impairment analyses in future years  and our future results will be adversely affected if we do not achieve benefits from these acquisitions commensurate with amortization and potential impairment charges 
for example  our acquisition of caere corporation included a substantial write off of acquired in process research and development costs  and this also may occur as a result of other acquisitions 
in connection with the caere  l h  speechworks and locusdialog acquisitions  we issued million  million  million and million shares of our common stock respectively 
we may continue to issue equity securities for future acquisitions and working capital purposes that could dilute our existing stockholders 
in connection with the l h acquisition  we issued a promissory note for million 
under the terms of the philips acquisition  we paid million euros in cash at closing  subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of the purchase agreement  as amended  agreed to pay an additional million euros in cash prior to december   issued a million euro note due december  and bearing interest per annum and issued a million three year  zero interest subordinated debenture  convertible at any time at philips option into shares of our common stock at per share 
in accordance with the provisions of the agreement  we agreed to a final purchase price adjustment with philips of approximately million  resulting in a corresponding reduction in goodwill 
we received million of the purchase price adjustment prior to december  the remaining million million euros was received on january  while we satisfied our payment obligations related to the additional million euros and million euro note prior to december   future acquisitions may also require us to expend significant funds or incur debt 
if we expend funds or incur additional debt  our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decrease 
the failure to successfully implement  upgrade and deploy in a timely and effective manner new information systems and upgrades of our finance and accounting systems to address certain issues identified in connection with our fiscal year end audit could harm our business 
in connection with its audit of our consolidated financial statements  pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc  our independent auditors  advised in a management letter to our audit committee of four conditions that could adversely affect our ability to initiate  record  process and report financial data consistent with management s assertions 
these conditions include i we may lack the necessary corporate accounting resources to meet the accelerated filing deadline requirements in mandated by the sec  while at the same time staffing the demands of our worldwide oracle implementation and sarbanes oxley requirements  and ii we have a dependence on key personnel in our finance and accounting organization  the loss of whom could impair our ability to perform timely financial reporting  especially prior to the completion of our worldwide oracle implementation and our readiness efforts related to our obligations under section of the sarbanes oxley act of in addition  we discuss the other two conditions raised by pwc later in this document see page 
from through december   we have made seven significant business acquisitions 
as a result  we continue to have several financial systems in use in the company 
the incompatibility between these systems requires significant manual efforts within finance and accounting to complete our financial reporting 
therefore  substantial knowledge of our policies and procedures and the process for initiating  recording  processing  summarizing and reporting financial information is resident in the knowledge of personnel involved in the financial reporting process 
to improve the efficiency and quality of our accounting and financial reporting systems  we commenced  in the third quarter of  a worldwide implementation of the oracle e business suite 
in addition  we have retained a third party consulting firm that is assisting management and staff to formalize and document our business and financial processes and controls in preparation for our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of while we believe that these actions will address the conditions raised in pwc s letter  we have been and will continue to be required to devote substantial resources to these activities during failure to successfully implement these systems or formalize and document these processes and controls in a timely  effective and efficient manner could result in the disruption of our operations  our inability to comply with our sarbanes oxley obligations and the inability to report our financial results in a timely manner 
sales of our document and pdf conversion products and our digital paper management products represented approximately and  of our revenue for the year ended december  and  respectively 
any reduction in revenue from these product areas could seriously harm our business 
historically  a few product areas have generated a substantial portion of our revenues 
for the year ended december   our document and pdf conversion products represented approximately of our revenue and our digital paper management products represented approximately of our revenue 
for the year ended december   our document and pdf conversion products represented approximately of our revenue and our digital paper management products represented approximately of our revenue 
a significant reduction in the revenue contribution from these product areas could seriously harm our business  results of operations  financial condition  cash flows and stock price 
the protection of our proprietary technology and intellectual property is key to our success 
we rely heavily on our proprietary technology  trade secrets and other intellectual property 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we may not be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use 
additionally  our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially the same or superior to ours 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
although the source code for our proprietary software is protected both as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation  regardless of the outcome  can be very expensive and can divert management efforts 
third parties have claimed and may claim in the future that we are infringing their intellectual property 
we could be exposed to significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products if such claims are successful 
like other technology companies  from time to time  we are subject to claims that we or our customers may be infringing or contributing to the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technologies and products 
if it appears necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses for these intellectual property rights 
however  we may not be able to obtain licenses from some or all claimants  the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us  and we may not be able to resolve disputes without litigation 
any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
in the event of a claim of intellectual property infringement  we may be required to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
third parties claiming intellectual property infringement may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to develop and sell our products 
on july   elliott davis davis filed an action against speechworks in the united states district court for the western district for new york buffalo claiming patent infringement 
damages are sought in an unspecified amount 
in addition  on november   davis filed an action against scansoft in the united states district court for the western district for new york buffalo also claiming patent infringement 
damages are sought in an unspecified amount 
speechworks filed an answer and counterclaim to davis s complaint in its case on august  and scansoft filed an answer and counterclaim to davis s complaint in its case on december  we believe these claims have no merit  and we intend to defend the actions vigorously 
on november   allvoice computing plc filed an action against us in the united states district court for the southern district of texas claiming patent infringement 
damages are sought in an unspecified amount 
we filed an answer on december  we believe this claim has no merit and we intend to defend the action vigorously 
on august   we were sued by horst froessl for patent infringement 
damages are sought in an unspecified amount 
we filed an answer and counterclaim on september  we believe this claim has no merit and we intend to defend the action vigorously 
we believe that the final outcome of the current litigation matters described above will not have a significant adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
however  even if our defense is successful  the litigation could require significant management time and could be costly 
should we not prevail in these litigation matters  our operating results  financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and rapidly changing 
we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants and established companies with greater resources 
there are a number of companies that develop or may develop products that compete in our targeted markets  however  there is no one company that competes with us in all of our product areas 
the individual markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and are rapidly changing 
within digital capture  we compete directly with abbyy  iris and newsoft 
within speech  we compete with at t  fonix  ibm  nuance communications and rhetorical 
vendors such as adobe and microsoft offer solutions that can be considered alternatives to some of our solutions 
in addition  a number of smaller companies produce technologies or products that are in some markets competitive with our solutions 
current and potential competitors have established  or may establish  cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their technologies to address the needs of our prospective customers 
the competition in these markets could adversely affect our operating results by reducing the volume of the products we sell or the prices we can charge 
some of our current or potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
they may also devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we do 
the price and performance of our products and technologies may not be superior relative to the products of our competitors 
as a result  we may lose competitive position that could result in lower prices  fewer customer orders  reduced revenue  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
our products and technologies may not achieve market acceptance or sell at favorable prices  which could hurt our revenue  results of operations and the price of our common stock 
some of our customers  such as microsoft  have developed or acquired products or technologies that compete with our products and technologies 
these customers may give higher priority to the sale of these competitive products or technologies 
to the extent they do so  market acceptance and penetration of our products  and therefore our revenue  may be adversely affected 
our success will depend substantially upon our ability to enhance our products and technologies and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and features that meet changing customer requirements and incorporate technological advancements 
if we are unable to develop new products and enhance functionalities or technologies to adapt to these changes  or are unable to realize synergies among our acquired products and technologies  our business will suffer 
our software products may have bugs  which could result in delayed or lost revenue  expensive correction  liability to our clients and claims against us 
complex software products such as ours may contain errors  defects or bugs 
defects in the solutions or products that we develop and sell to our customers could require expensive corrections and result in delayed or lost revenue  adverse client reaction and negative publicity about us or our products and services 
customers who are not satisfied with any of our products could bring claims against us for damages  which  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming to defend  and could result in costly litigation and payment of damages 
such claims could harm our financial results and competitive position 
we rely on a small number of distribution and fulfillment partners  including  digital river  ingram micro and tech data  to distribute many of our products 
any disruption in these channels could harm our results of operations 
our products are sold through  and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from  a network of over channel partners  including value added resellers  computer superstores  consumer electronic stores  mail order houses  office superstores and ecommerce web sites 
we rely on a small number of distribution and fulfillment partners  including  digital river  ingram micro and tech data to serve this network of channel partners 
for the year ended december   two distribution and fulfillment partners  ingram micro and digital river  accounted for and of our consolidated revenue  respectively 
during the year ended december   ingram micro and digital river  accounted for and of our consolidated revenue  respectively 
a disruption in these distribution and fulfillment partner relationships could negatively affect our results of operations in the short term 
any disruption for which we are unable to compensate could have a more sustained impact on our results of operations 
a significant portion of our accounts receivable is concentrated among our three largest distribution and fulfillment partners  ingram micro  inc  tech data corporation  and digital river  inc 
our products are sold through  and a substantial portion of our accounts receivable is derived from  three distribution and fulfillment partners 
at december   ingram micro  tech data and digital river represented  and  of our net accounts receivable  respectively 
at december   ingram micro  tech data and digital river represented  and  of our net accounts receivable  respectively 
in addition  although we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our distribution and fulfillment partners financial condition and maintain reserves for potential credit losses  we do not require collateral 
while  to date  such losses have been within our expectations  we cannot assure you that these actions will be sufficient to meet future contingencies 
if any of these distribution and fulfillment partners were unable to pay us in a timely fashion or if we were to experience significant credit losses in excess of our reserves  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition would be seriously harmed 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales in europe and asia 
our results could be harmed by economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with these and other international regions 
since we sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we anticipate that revenue from international operations will represent an increasing portion of our total revenue 
reported international revenue for both the years ended december  and december  represented and of our consolidated revenue for those periods  respectively 
most of these international revenues are produced by sales in europe and asia 
a number of our oem partners distribute their products throughout the world and do not provide us with the geographical dispersion of their products 
however  based on an estimate that factors our oem partners geographical revenue mix to our revenue generated from these oem partners  international revenue would have represented approximately and of our consolidated revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
therefore  in addition to risks to our business based on a potential downturn in the world economy  a region specific downturn affecting countries in western europe and or asia could have a negative effect on our future results of operations 
in addition  some of our products are developed and manufactured outside the united states 
a significant portion of the development and manufacturing of our speech products are completed in belgium  and a significant portion of our digital capture research and development is conducted in hungary 
in connection with the philips acquisition  we have added an additional research and development location in germany 
in connection with the acquisition of locus dialog  we have added an additional research and development location in montreal  canada 
our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors associated with international sales and operations  including changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements imposed by the united states or by other countries  negative consequences from changes in applicable tax laws  difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations in many countries  difficulties in collecting trade accounts receivable in other countries  and less effective protection of intellectual property 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
because we have international subsidiaries and distributors that operate and sell our products outside the united states  we are exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 
in certain circumstances  we have entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany balances with our foreign subsidiaries 
we use these contracts to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as the gains or losses on these contracts are intended to offset any exchange rate losses or gains on the hedged transaction 
we do not engage in foreign currency speculation 
hedges are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge and are evaluated for effectiveness monthly 
forward exchange contracts hedging firm commitments qualify for hedge accounting when they are designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure and they are effective in minimizing such exposure 
with our increased international presence in a number of geographic locations and with international revenues projected to increase in  we are exposed to changes in foreign currencies including the euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen and the hungarian forint 
changes in the value of the euro or other foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar could adversely affect future revenues and operating results 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our business could be harmed 
if any of our key employees were to leave us  we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience 
our employment relationships are generally at will and we have had key employees leave us in the past 
we cannot assure you that one or more key employees will not leave us in the future 
we intend to continue to hire additional highly qualified personnel  including software engineers and operational personnel  but we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future 
any failure to attract  integrate  motivate and retain these employees could harm our business 
the stockholdings of our two largest stockholders may enable them to influence matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of december   xerox beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock  including warrants exercisable for up to  shares of our common stock and  shares of our outstanding series b preferred stock  each of which is convertible into one share of our common stock 
the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the xerox warrant may increase in accordance with a formula defined in the warrant agreement 
the state of wisconsin investment board swib is our second largest stockholder  owning approximately of our common stock as of december  because of their large holdings of our capital stock relative to other stockholders  xerox and swib  acting individually or together  could have a strong influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
our stock price historically has been and may continue to be volatile 
various factors contribute to the volatility of our stock price  including  for example  quarterly variations in our financial results  new product introductions by us or our competitors and general economic and market conditions 
while we cannot predict the individual effect that these factors may have on the market price of our common stock  these factors  either individually or in the aggregate  could result in significant volatility in our stock price during any given period of time 
moreover  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock often are subject to securities class action litigation 
if we were the subject of such litigation  it could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq national market rules  are resulting in increased general and administrative expenses for companies such as ours 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies  our business may be harmed 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions  which could discourage or prevent a takeover  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include a preferred shares rights agreement  authorized blank check preferred stock  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  limiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at meetings of our stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of directors and for stockholder proposals 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  as a significant portion of our revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro  the canadian dollar  the japanese yen and the hungarian forint 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
we evaluate our foreign currency exposures on an ongoing basis and make adjustments to our foreign currency risk management program as circumstances change 
in certain instances  we have entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as the gains or losses on these contracts are intended to offset the exchange rate losses or gains on the underlying exposures 
we do not engage in foreign currency speculation 
the success of our foreign currency risk management program depends upon the ability of the forward exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency risk associated with the hedged transaction 
to the extent that the amount or duration of the forward exchange contract and hedged transaction vary  we could experience unanticipated foreign currency gains or losses that could have a material impact on our results of operations 
in addition  the failure to identify new exposures and hedge them in a timely manner may result in material foreign currency gains and losses 
in connection with the philips acquisition on january   we entered into a forward hedge in the amount of million to cover our obligation to pay the million euro promissory note philips note issued as part of the acquisition 
on august   we entered into a forward exchange contract to hedge the foreign currency exposure of our million euro note payable to philips 
as both the million euro promissory note and million euro note payable to philips were paid prior to december   the related forward hedge and forward exchange contract have terminated 
on november   we entered into a forward exchange contract to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to million euros of inter company receivables from our belgian subsidiary to the united states 
the contract has a one year term that expires on november  on november   we entered into a forward exchange contract to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to million singapore dollars of inter company receivables from our singapore subsidiary to the united states 
the contract expired on january  while the contract amounts of derivative instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions  they do not represent the amount of our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
because the terms of the derivative instrument and underlying exposure are matched generally at inception  changes in foreign currency exchange rates should not expose us to significant losses in earnings or net cash outflows when exposures are properly hedged
