item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in item herein 
overview background we are a public utility holding company  created on august  as part of a corporate restructuring of reliant energy  incorporated reliant energy in compliance with requirements of the texas electric restructuring law 
we are the successor to reliant energy for financial reporting purposes under the securities exchange act of our operating subsidiaries own and operate electric generation plants  electric transmission and distribution facilities  natural gas distribution facilities and natural gas pipelines 
we are a registered holding company under the public utility holding company act of  as amended act 
for information about the act  please read liquidity and capital resources future sources and uses of cash certain contractual and regulatory limits on ability to issue securities and pay dividends on our common stock 
our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries include centerpoint energy houston electric  llc centerpoint houston  which owns and operates our electric transmission and distribution business in the texas gulf coast area  and centerpoint energy resources corp 
cerc corp  and together with its subsidiaries  cerc  which owns and operates our local gas distribution companies  gas gathering systems and interstate pipelines 
we also have an approximately ownership interest in texas genco holdings  inc texas genco  which owns and operates the texas generating plants formerly belonging to the integrated electric utility that was a part of reliant energy 
we distributed the remaining of the outstanding common stock of texas genco to our shareholders in january at the time of reliant energy s corporate restructuring  it owned an interest in reliant resources  inc reliant resources 
on september   we distributed that interest to our shareholders the reliant resources distribution 
business segments in this section  we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments 
we also discuss our liquidity  capital resources and critical accounting policies 
centerpoint energy is first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on this segment of the energy business 
the results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather  customer growth  cost management and rate proceedings before regulatory agencies 
effective with the full deregulation of sales of electric energy to retail customers in texas beginning in january  power generators and retail electric providers in texas ceased to be subject to traditional cost based regulation 
since that date  we have sold generation capacity  energy and ancillary services related to power generation at prices determined by the market 
the texas generation operations are reported in the electric generation business segment 
our transmission and distribution services remain subject to rate regulation and are reported in the electric transmission distribution business segment as are impacts of generation related stranded costs recoverable by the regulated utility 
although our former retail sales business is no longer conducted by us  retail customers remained regulated customers of our former integrated electric utility  reliant energy hl p  through the date of their first meter reading in sales of electricity to retail customers in prior to this meter reading are reflected in the electric transmission distribution business segment 
our reportable business segments include electric transmission and distribution our electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission and distribution services to approximately million metered customers in a  square mile area of the texas gulf coast that has a population of approximately million people and includes houston 
centerpoint houston transports electricity from power plants to substations and from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in locations throughout the control area managed by the electric reliability council of texas  inc ercot on behalf of retail electric providers 
ercot is an intrastate network which serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in texas 
the ercot market represents approximately of the demand for power in texas and is one of the nation s largest power markets 
transmission services are provided under tariffs approved by the public utility commission of texas the texas utility commission 
operations include construction and maintenance of electric transmission and distribution facilities  metering services  outage response services and other call center operations 
distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the texas utility commission 
electric generation texas genco owns and operates generating units at power generation facilities 
texas genco also owns a interest in the south texas project electric generating station south texas project  a nuclear generating station with two  megawatt mw nuclear generating units 
as of december   the aggregate net generating capacity of texas genco s portfolio of generating assets was  mw  of which  mw of gas fired capacity are currently mothballed 
texas genco sells electric generation capacity  energy and ancillary services in the ercot market 
collectively  texas genco s facilities provide over of the aggregate net generating capacity serving the ercot market 
natural gas distribution cerc owns and operates our natural gas distribution business  which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to  and natural gas transportation for  approximately million residential  commercial and industrial customers in arkansas  louisiana  minnesota  mississippi  oklahoma and texas 
these operations are regulated as natural gas utility operations 
its operations also include non rate regulated retail gas sales to and transportation services for commercial and industrial customers in the six states listed above as well as several other midwestern states 
pipelines and gathering cerc s pipelines and gathering business operates two interstate natural gas pipelines as well as gas gathering facilities and also provides pipeline services 
cerc s pipeline operations provides natural gas transportation  natural gas storage and pipeline services to customers principally in arkansas  louisiana  missouri and oklahoma 
cerc s gathering operations are conducted principally in arkansas  louisiana  oklahoma and texas 
other operations our other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations 
executive summary highlights our operating performance and cash flow for compared to were affected by a million increase in operating income at texas genco due to higher capacity auction prices  continued customer growth with the addition of nearly  metered electric and gas customers since december  or an annualized growth  an increase of million in revenues in the natural gas distribution operations from rate increases  an increase of million in interest expense  an increase of million in operation and maintenance expense related to centerpoint houston s final fuel reconciliation  an increase of million in pension  employee benefit and insurance costs  and a reduction of million in capital expenditures 
net income for includes an million after tax non cash gain per diluted share from the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
as further discussed below under consolidated results of operations 
excluded from the million after tax cumulative effect of accounting change recorded during the three months ended march   is minority interest of million related to the texas genco stock not owned by centerpoint energy 
in  we accessed the capital markets to raise approximately billion 
we used these proceeds to repay maturing debt  refinance higher coupon debt  pay down our short term credit facilities and enhance our liquidity 
centerpoint energy distributed approximately of the million outstanding shares of common stock of texas genco to its shareholders on january  texas genco distribution 
as a result of the texas genco distribution  centerpoint energy recorded an impairment charge of million  which is reflected as a regulatory asset representing stranded costs on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  this impairment charge represents the excess of the carrying value of centerpoint energy s net investment in texas genco over the market value of the texas genco common stock that was distributed 
the financial impact of this impairment was offset by recording a million regulatory asset reflecting centerpoint energy s expectation of stranded cost recovery of such impairment 
since this amount is expected to be recovered in the true up proceeding  centerpoint houston has recorded a regulatory asset  reflecting its right to recover this amount  and an associated payable to us 
any additional impairment or loss that centerpoint energy incurs on its texas genco investment that centerpoint houston expects to recover as stranded investment will be recorded in the same manner 
significant events in during  we expect to complete additional steps in a process that began when texas adopted legislation designed to deregulate and restructure the electric utility industry in the state 
that legislation texas electric restructuring law required integrated electric utilities to separate their generating  transmission and distribution and retail sales functions pursuant to plans approved by the texas utility commission 
the texas electric restructuring law contains provisions that allow our transmission and distribution utility  centerpoint houston  to recover the amount by which the market value of our generating assets  as determined by the texas utility commission under a formula prescribed in the law  is below the regulatory net book value for those assets as of the end of it also allows centerpoint houston to recover certain other transition costs  such as a final fuel reconciliation balance  regulatory assets and the difference between the texas utility commission s projected market prices for generation during and and actual market prices for generation as determined in the state mandated capacity auctions during that period called the ecom true up 
those amounts  and certain other adjustments  are to be determined by the texas utility commission in a proceeding that will begin on march  true up proceeding 
the law requires a final order to be issued by the texas utility commission not more than days after a proper filing is made by the regulated utility  although  under its rules the texas utility commission can extend the day deadline for good cause 
after the texas utility commission determines the amount of the true up components the true up balance that the utility may recover  the utility will recover those amounts through a transition charge added to its transmission and distribution rates 
assuming receipt of a timely final order from the texas utility commission  we expect to begin earning a non cash rate of return on the true up balance in the third quarter of we intend to seek authority from the texas utility commission to securitize all or a portion of the true up balance as early as the fourth quarter of through the issuance of transition bonds and to be in a position to issue those bonds by early transition bonds would be issued through a special purpose entity that would be a subsidiary of centerpoint houston  but they would be non recourse to centerpoint houston 
any portion of the true up balance not securitized by transition bonds will be recovered through a non bypassable competition transition charge 
centerpoint houston will distribute recovery of the true up components not used to repay indebtedness to us through either the payment of dividends or the settlement of intercompany payables 
we can then move funds back to centerpoint houston  either through equity or intercompany debt  in order to maintain centerpoint houston s capital structure at the appropriate levels 
as discussed above  in accordance with the texas electric restructuring law  we expect to seek recovery of substantial amounts for the true up components 
determination of the amounts actually recovered will be made by the texas utility commission in a proceeding in which we expect that various parties will challenge our claims  potentially resulting in an award of less than the full amount to which we believe centerpoint houston is entitled 
an ultimate determination or a settlement at an amount less than that recorded in our financial statements could lead to a charge that would materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
for some time  we have expected to monetize our remaining interest in texas genco in in january  reliant resources did not exercise its option to purchase our interest in texas genco 
we have engaged a financial advisor to assist us in exploring the sale of our interest in texas genco 
any proceeds from the monetization of texas genco are expected to be used to repay indebtedness 
the alternatives for monetization of our remaining interest in texas genco may not be completed in and may result in receipt of proceeds in an amount different from the market valuation placed on texas genco in the true up proceeding 
to the extent that the texas utility commission uses a market value higher than the amount ultimately realized from the sale of texas genco  a loss would be recognized 
the completion of the true up proceeding and recovery of stranded costs is not dependent on the sale of texas genco 
resolution of the true up proceeding and the monetization of our remaining interest in texas genco are the two most significant events facing the company in these events are expected to result in aggregate proceeds of over billion based on the texas utility commission rules 
we have committed to use these proceeds to repay our indebtedness 
either or both events could  however  lead to charges against earnings 
if those charges occur early in the year or are of sufficient magnitude  they could reduce our earnings below the level required for us to continue paying our current quarterly dividends out of current earnings as required under our securities and exchange commission sec financing order 
we expect to file an application with the sec under the act requesting an order authorizing us  in the event we are required to take such a charge against earnings  to pay quarterly dividends out of capital or unearned surplus 
the texas utility commission issued a final order in october october order that established the transmission and distribution utility rates that became effective in january in this order  the texas utility commission found that centerpoint houston had over mitigated its stranded costs by redirecting transmission and distribution depreciation and by accelerating depreciation of generation assets as provided under the transition plan and texas electric restructuring law 
as a result of the october order  centerpoint houston was required to refund billion through excess mitigation credits to certain retail electric customers during a seven year period which began in january  and which amount to approximately million per year 
amounts refunded will be considered in the true up proceeding  and we expect that such refunds will be discontinued as a result of the true up proceeding 
in connection with the implementation of the texas electric restructuring law  the texas utility commission has set a price to beat that retail electric providers affiliated or formerly affiliated with a former integrated utility must charge residential and small commercial customers within their affiliated electric utility s service area 
the true up proceeding provides for a clawback of the price to beat in excess of the market price of electricity if of the price to beat load is not served by a non affiliated retail electric provider by january  pursuant to the texas electric restructuring law and the master separation agreement entered into in connection with the september  spin off of our interest in reliant resources to our shareholders  reliant resources is obligated to pay centerpoint houston for the clawback component of the true up proceeding 
based on an order issued on february  by the texas utility commission  the clawback will equal times the number of residential customers served by reliant resources in centerpoint houston s service territory  less the number of residential customers served by reliant resources outside centerpoint houston s service territory  on january  as reported in reliant resources annual report on form k for the year ended december   reliant resources expects that the clawback payment will be million 
we expect that before  or upon  issuance of a final order in the true up proceeding we will receive the clawback payment from reliant resources  which will reduce the amount of recoverable costs to be determined in the true up proceeding 
the true up proceeding will include the balance from the final fuel reconciliation proceeding for the fuel component of electric rates 
prior to the beginning of competition  fuel costs were a component of electric rates and those costs were reviewed and reconciled periodically by the texas utility commission 
although the final fuel reconciliation is a separate proceeding that is currently underway  the final fuel over or under recovery balance will be included in the true up proceeding  either as a reduction to or increase in the amount to be recovered 
following adoption of the true up rule by the texas utility commission in  centerpoint houston appealed the provisions of the rule that permitted interest to be recovered on stranded costs only from the date of the texas utility commission s final order in the true up proceeding  instead of from january  as centerpoint houston contends is required by law 
on january   the texas supreme court granted our petition for review of the true up rule 
oral arguments were heard on february  the decision by the court is pending 
we have not accrued interest income on stranded costs in our consolidated financial statements  but estimate such interest income would be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we recorded non cash ecom revenue of million in and million in we are no longer permitted under the texas electric restructuring law to record non cash ecom revenue in the reduction in interest costs that should result from the use of proceeds of securitization and monetization to reduce debt  to the extent received in  should help offset the resulting reductions in earnings  but both the amount and timing of these securitization and monetization efforts is a function of the regulatory process described above 
process improvement initiative in late  we launched a company wide process improvement effort designed to examine key aspects of how we conduct our business  and identify  design and implement improvements to enhance service quality  improve customer satisfaction and reduce costs 
in  we identified our core business processes and established process teams 
progress was made in understanding existing processes and identifying opportunities for improvement 
over the next several years  we plan to design and implement processes that will improve productivity and efficiency  reduce our cost structure and enhance service to our customers 
certain factors affecting future earnings our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations 
the magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors including the timing and outcome of the regulatory process leading to the determination and recovery of the true up components and the securitization of these amounts  the timing and results of the monetization of our interest in texas genco  state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments  including deregulation  re regulation and restructuring of the electric utility industry  constraints placed on our activities or business by the act  changes in or application of laws or regulations applicable to other aspects of our business and actions with respect to allowed rates of return  rate structures  recovery of investments  and operation and construction of facilities  termination of accruals of ecom true up after  industrial  commercial and residential growth in our service territory and changes in market demand and demographic patterns  the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices  particularly natural gas  changes in interest rates or rates of inflation  weather variations and other natural phenomena  the timing and extent of changes in the supply of natural gas  commercial bank and financial market conditions  our access to capital  the cost of such capital  receipt of certain approvals under the act  and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts  including availability of funds in the debt capital markets  actions by rating agencies  inability of various counterparties to meet their obligations to us  non payment for our services due to financial distress of our customers  including reliant resources  the outcome of the pending securities lawsuits against us  reliant energy and reliant resources  the ability of reliant resources to satisfy its obligations to us  including indemnity obligations and obligations to pay the price to beat clawback  and other factors discussed in item of this report under risk factors

as a result  there are no meaningful comparisons for these two business segments prior to in  we will no longer be permitted under the texas electric restructuring law to record non cash ecom revenue 
usage volumes for commercial and industrial customers are included in total throughput  however  the majority of these customers are billed on a peak demand kw basis and  as a result  revenues do not vary based on consumption 
compared to the electric transmission distribution business segment reported a decrease in operating income of million for compared to increased revenues from customer growth million were more than offset by transition period revenues that only occurred in million and decreased industrial demand  resulting in an overall decrease in electric revenues from the regulated electric transmission and distribution business of million 
additionally  non cash ecom revenue decreased million as a result of higher operating margins at the electric generation business segment based on the state mandated capacity auctions 
operation and maintenance expenses decreased in compared to primarily due to the absence of purchased power costs that occurred in during the transition period to deregulation million  a decrease in labor costs as a result of work force reductions in million  non recurring contract services expense primarily related to transition to deregulation in million and lower bad debt expense related to transition revenues in million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses related to centerpoint houston s final fuel reconciliation million and an increase in benefits expense primarily due to increased pension costs million 
taxes other than income taxes decreased million primarily due to the absence of gross receipts tax associated with transition period revenue in the first quarter of million 
compared to the electric transmission distribution business segment  reported an increase in operating income of million for as compared to  of which million related to non cash ecom revenue recorded pursuant to the texas electric restructuring law 
electric revenues from the regulated electric transmission and distribution business decreased million primarily as a result of the transition to a deregulated ercot market in throughput declined during as compared to the decrease was primarily due to reduced energy delivery in the industrial sector resulting from self generation by several major customers  partially offset by increased residential usage primarily due to non weather related factors 
additionally  despite a slowing economy  total metered customers continued to grow at an annual rate of approximately during the year 
operation and maintenance expenses decreased in as compared to primarily due to a decrease in factoring expense as a result of the termination of an agreement under which the electric transmission distribution business segment had sold its customer accounts receivable million and decreased transmission line losses in as this became a cost of retail electric providers in million  partially offset by purchased power costs related to operation of the regulated utility during the transition period to deregulation million  an increase in benefits expense million which included severance costs in connection with a reduction in work force by centerpoint houston in and expenses related to centerpoint houston s final fuel reconciliation million 
depreciation and amortization decreased in as compared to primarily as a result of decreased amortization relating to certain regulatory assets million partially offset by increased amortization related to transition property associated with the transition bonds issued in november million 
taxes other than income decreased largely as a result of lower gross receipts taxes million  which became the responsibility of the retail electric providers upon deregulation

as a result  there are no meaningful comparisons for these two business segments prior to compared to our electric generation business segment s operating income increased million in compared to primarily due to increased operating margins million from higher capacity and energy revenues as a result of higher capacity auction prices driven by higher natural gas prices  partially offset by increased fuel costs due to higher natural gas prices and lower sales volumes 
our electric generation business segment was able to partially mitigate the higher cost of natural gas by switching to fuel oil on some of its flexible natural gas units  as well as benefiting from reductions in coal and lignite costs on its base load units resulting from renegotiated supply agreements and increased utilization of spot purchases 
additionally  the sale of surplus air emission allowances  which is expected to recur in  contributed to the increase in operating margins million 
partially offsetting the increase in operating margins was a higher level of operation and maintenance expense primarily related to planned and unplanned outages million and higher pension and insurance expenses million 
these increases in operation and maintenance expense were partially offset by expenses incurred in  which did not recur in  the most significant of which were in connection with an early retirement program and business separation costs million 
compared to our electric generation business segment s operating income decreased million in compared to primarily due to decreased revenues resulting from the change from a regulated environment in to the deregulated ercot market billion 
the electric generation business segment s revenue was derived based on actual recoverable operating expenses plus an allowed regulatory rate of return based on the rate base while its revenue was derived from open market sales of capacity and energy at auction and spot market prices 
additionally  fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices and a reduction in overall demand for output from texas genco s facilities billion 
operation and maintenance expense decreased primarily due to an absence of major maintenance outages at certain of texas genco s plants million in  which was partially offset by costs related to an early retirement program implemented in million  business separation expenses million and computer systems necessary for operation in the deregulated market million 
taxes other than income taxes decreased primarily due to lower tax valuations of generation assets million

these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues as a result of a decrease in the estimate of margins earned on unbilled revenues million 
additionally  operating income was negatively impacted by higher employee benefit expenses primarily due to increased pension costs million  certain costs being included in operating expense subsequent to the amendment of a receivables facility in november as compared to being included in interest expense in the prior year million and increased bad debt expense primarily due to higher gas prices million 
compared to our natural gas distribution business segment s operating income increased million in compared to primarily as a result of improved margins from rate increases in  a increase in throughput and changes in estimates of unbilled revenues and deferred gas costs  which reduced operating margins in million

in october  centerpoint houston was required by the texas utility commission to reverse the amount of redirected depreciation and accelerated depreciation taken for regulatory purposes as allowed under the transition plan and the texas electric restructuring law 
centerpoint houston recorded a regulatory liability to reflect the prospective refund of the accelerated depreciation and in january centerpoint houston began refunding excess mitigation credits  which are to be refunded over a seven year period 
the annual refund of excess mitigation credits is approximately million 
under the texas electric restructuring law  a final determination of these stranded costs will occur in the true up proceeding 
off balance sheet arrangements 
other than operating leases  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
however  we do participate in a receivables factoring arrangement 
in connection with cerc s november amendment and extension of its million receivables facility  cerc corp 
formed a bankruptcy remote subsidiary  which we consolidate  for the sole purpose of buying receivables created by cerc and selling those receivables to an unrelated third party 
this transaction is accounted for as a sale of receivables under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and  as a result  the related receivables are excluded from the consolidated balance sheet 
on june   we elected to reduce the receivables facility to million and in january  the million receivables facility was replaced with a million receivables facility terminating in january for additional information regarding this transaction please read note i to our consolidated financial statements 
long term and short term debt 
our long term debt consists of our obligations and the obligations of our subsidiaries  including transition bonds issued by an indirect wholly owned subsidiary transition bonds 
in and february  we and our subsidiaries completed several capital market transactions which converted a significant amount of our interest payment obligations from floating rates to fixed rates and refinanced current maturities of long term debt 
the proceeds of the debt transactions in were primarily used to refinance existing short term debt with long term debt  refinance maturing debt and pay related debt issuance costs 
our capital market transactions included the following principal interest issuance date borrower security amount rate maturity date in thousands march centerpoint houston general mortgage bonds  march and march and april cerc corp 
senior notes  april april centerpoint energy pollution control bonds  december and may may centerpoint energy convertible senior notes  may may centerpoint houston general mortgage bonds  july may centerpoint energy senior notes  june and july centerpoint energy pollution control bonds  august and october september centerpoint energy senior notes  september september centerpoint houston general mortgage bonds  january november cerc corp 
senior notes  january december centerpoint energy convertible senior notes  january in  we and our subsidiaries also entered into new credit facilities which increased liquidity  reduced financing costs and extended the termination dates of the facilities they replaced 
as of december   we had the following credit facilities 
size of amount facility at outstanding at december  december  type of date executed company termination date facility in millions march  cerc corp 
march  revolver october  centerpoint energy  october  revolver october  centerpoint energy october  term loan december  texas genco  lp december  revolver mandatory quarterly payments through september  of million per quarter 
cerc corp 
is currently in discussions with banks seeking to arrange a replacement revolving credit facility and expects to have such a facility in place prior to the termination date of the existing facility 
in the first quarter of  cerc replaced its million receivables facility with a million committed one year receivables facility 
the bankruptcy remote subsidiary established in continues to buy cerc s receivables and sell them to an unrelated third party 
additionally  in february  million aggregate principal amount of collateralized pollution control bonds due and million aggregate principal amount of collateralized insurance backed pollution control bonds due were issued on behalf of centerpoint houston 
the pollution control bonds are collateralized by general mortgage bonds of centerpoint houston with principal amounts  interest rates and maturities that match the pollution control bonds 
the proceeds were used to redeem two series of collateralized pollution control bonds with an aggregate principal amount of million issued on our behalf 
centerpoint houston s first mortgage bonds which collateralized our payment obligations under the refunded pollution control bonds were retired in connection with the march redemption of the refunded pollution control bonds 
centerpoint houston s notes payable to us were extinguished upon the redemption of the refunded pollution control bonds 
on december   we had temporary external investments of million 
at december   centerpoint energy had a shelf registration statement covering million shares of common stock and cerc corp 
had a shelf registration statement covering million principal amount of debt securities 
cash requirements in our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  and working capital needs 
our principal cash requirements during  assuming we continue to own our interest in texas genco for the full year  include the following approximately million of capital expenditures  an estimated million in refunds by centerpoint houston of excess mitigation credits  dividend payments on centerpoint energy common stock  million of maturing long term debt  including million of transition bonds  and maturity of any borrowings under cerc s million revolving credit agreement 
we expect that revolving credit borrowings and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for our billion credit facility provides that  until such time as the credit facility has been reduced to million  all of the net cash proceeds from any securitizations relating to the recovery of the true up components  after making any payments required under centerpoint houston s term loan  and the net cash proceeds of any sales of the common stock of texas genco that we own or of material portions of texas genco s assets shall be applied to repay borrowings under our credit facility and reduce the amount available under the credit facility 
our billion credit facility contains no other restrictions with respect to our use of proceeds from financing activities 
centerpoint houston s term loan requires the proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds to be used to reduce the term loan unless refused by the lenders 
centerpoint houston s term loan  subject to certain exceptions  limits the application of proceeds from capital markets transactions by centerpoint houston over million to repayment of debt existing in november centerpoint houston will distribute recovery of the true up components not used to repay indebtedness to us through either the payment of dividends or the settlement of intercompany payables 
we can then move funds back to centerpoint houston  either through equity or intercompany debt  in order to maintain centerpoint houston s capital structure at the appropriate levels 
under the orders described under certain contractual and regulatory limits on ability to issue securities and pay dividends on our common stock  centerpoint houston s member s equity as a percentage of total capitalization must be at least  although the sec has permitted the percentage to be below this level for other companies taking into account non recourse securitization debt as a component of capitalization 
impact on liquidity of a downgrade in credit ratings 
as of march   moody s investors service  inc moody s  standard poor s ratings services  a division of the mcgraw hill companies s p  and fitch  inc fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of centerpoint energy and certain subsidiaries moody s s p fitch company instrument rating outlook rating outlook rating outlook centerpoint energy senior unsecured debt ba negative bbb negative bbb negative centerpoint houston senior secured debt first mortgage bonds baa negative bbb negative bbb negative cerc corp 
senior debt ba negative bbb negative bbb negative a negative outlook from moody s reflects concerns over the next to months which will either lead to a review for a potential downgrade or a return to a stable outlook 
an s p rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term 
a negative outlook from fitch encompasses a one to two year horizon as to the likely ratings direction 
on february   moody s announced that it was downgrading our senior unsecured debt to ba from ba moody s explained in its announcement that the action was to reflect the structural differences in rights and claims afforded to our senior secured bank lenders  who benefit from their priority claim on proceeds from the monetization of texas genco and from the up streaming of proceeds resulting from securitization of the true up components at centerpoint houston 
moody s announced that its action concluded a review for possible downgrade of us that it initiated in october moody s retained a negative ratings outlook for us and for our subsidiaries cerc corp 
and centerpoint houston  but their ratings remain unchanged 
we cannot assure you that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency 
we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and long term financing  the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies 
a decline in credit ratings would increase borrowing costs under cerc s million revolving credit facility 
a decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long term debt to be issued in the capital markets and would negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions 
if we were unable to maintain an investment grade rating from at least one rating agency  as a registered public utility holding company we would be required to obtain further approval from the sec for any additional capital markets transactions as more fully described in certain contractual and regulatory limits on ability to issue securities and pay dividends on our common stock below 
additionally  a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts relating to gas purchases  gas price hedging and gas storage activities of our natural gas distribution business segment 
our revolving credit facilities contain material adverse change clauses that could impact our ability to make new borrowings under these facilities 
the material adverse change clauses in our revolving credit facilities generally relate to an event  development or circumstance that has or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on a the business  financial condition or operations of the borrower and its subsidiaries taken as a whole  or b the legality  validity or enforceability of the loan documents 
in september  we issued zero premium exchangeable subordinated notes due zens having an original principal amount of billion 
each zens note is exchangeable at the holder s option at any time for an amount of cash equal to of the market value of the reference shares of time warner inc tw common attributable to each zens note 
if our creditworthiness were to drop such that zens note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens notes were to become illiquid  some zens noteholders might decide to exchange their zens notes for cash 
funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of tw common that we own or from other sources 
we own shares of tw common equal to of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the zens notes 
zens note exchanges result in a cash outflow because deferred tax liabilities related to the zens notes and tw common shares become current tax obligations when zens notes are exchanged and tw common shares are sold 
centerpoint energy gas services  inc cegs  a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp  provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services to industrial and commercial customers which are primarily located within or near the territories served by our pipelines and natural gas distribution subsidiaries 
in order to hedge its exposure to natural gas prices  cegs has agreements with provisions standard for the industry that establish credit thresholds and require a party to provide additional collateral on two business days notice when that party s rating or the rating of a credit support provider for that party cerc corp 
in this case falls below those levels 
as of december   the senior unsecured debt of cerc corp 
was rated bbb by s p and ba by moody s 
we estimate that as of december   unsecured credit limits extended to cegs by counterparties could aggregate million  however  utilized credit capacity is significantly lower 
cross defaults 
under our revolving credit facility and our term loan  a payment default on  or a non payment default that permits acceleration of  any indebtedness exceeding million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default 
pursuant to the indenture governing our senior notes  a payment default by us  cerc corp 
or centerpoint houston in respect of  or an acceleration of  borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations  in the aggregate principal amount of million will cause a default 
as of february   we had issued five series of senior notes aggregating billion in principal amount under this indenture 
a default by centerpoint energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments 
pension plan 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we maintain a non contributory pension plan covering substantially all employees 
employer contributions are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes 
no contributions were made to the plan during at december  and  the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets by million and million  respectively 
in september  we elected to make a million contribution to our pension plan 
as a result  we will not be required to make any contributions to our pension plan prior to changes in interest rates and the market values of the securities held by the plan during could materially  positively or negatively  change our under funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in and beyond 
plan assets used to satisfy pension obligations have been adversely impacted by the decline in equity market values prior to under the terms of our pension plan  we reserve the right to change  modify or terminate the plan 
our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension costs in the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants 
pension costs were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
included in the net pension cost in was million of expense related to reliant resources participants 
for  a pension benefit of million was recorded related to reliant resources participants 
pension benefit and expense for reliant resources participants are reflected in the statement of consolidated operations as discontinued operations 
additionally  we maintain a non qualified benefit restoration plan which allows participants to retain the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on these benefits or on the level of compensation on which these benefits may be calculated 
the expense associated with this non qualified plan was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
included in the cost in and is million and million  respectively  of expense related to reliant resources participants  which is reflected in discontinued operations in the statements of consolidated operations 
the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
as of december   the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was 
we believe that our actual asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of  which is a 
decline from the discount rate assumed in the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligation specific to the characteristics of our plan 
pension expense for  including the benefit restoration plan  is estimated to be million based on an expected return on plan assets of and a discount rate of as of december  if the expected return assumption were lowered by 
from to  pension expense would increase by approximately million 
similarly  if the discount rate were lowered by 
from to  this assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation  pension liabilities and pension expense by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  the assumption change would result in an additional charge to comprehensive income during of million  net of tax 
primarily due to the decline in the market value of the pension plan s assets and increased benefit obligations associated with a reduction in the discount rate  the value of the plan s assets is less than our accumulated benefit obligation 
as a result  we recorded a non cash minimum liability adjustment  which resulted in a charge to other comprehensive income during the fourth quarter of of million  net of tax 
in december  we recorded a minimum liability adjustment in the consolidated balance sheet million decrease in pension liability to reflect a liability equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation  with an offsetting credit of million to equity  net of a million deferred tax effect 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
other factors that could affect cash requirements 
in addition to the above factors  our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts  including gas purchases  gas price hedging and gas storage activities of our natural gas distribution business segment  particularly given gas price levels and volatility  acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain circumstances  as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of suppliers  increased costs related to the acquisition of gas for storage  increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings  various regulatory actions  and the ability of reliant resources and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations as the principal customers of centerpoint houston and texas genco and in respect of reliant resources indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries 
money pool 
we have two money pools through which our participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short term basis 
funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position 
prior to october  we had only one money pool 
following texas genco s certification by ferc as an exempt wholesale generator under the act in october  it could no longer participate with our regulated subsidiaries in the same money pool 
in october  we established a second money pool in which texas genco and certain of our other unregulated subsidiaries can participate 
the net funding requirements of the money pool in which our regulated subsidiaries participate are expected to be met with loans and revolving credit facilities 
except in an emergency situation in which case we could provide funding pursuant to applicable sec rules  we would be required to obtain approval from the sec to issue and sell securities for purposes of funding texas genco s operations via the money pool established in october the terms of both money pools are in accordance with requirements applicable to registered public utility holding companies under the act and under an order from the sec relating to our financing activities and those of our subsidiaries on june  june financing order 
certain contractual and regulatory limits on ability to issue securities and pay dividends on our common stock 
factors affecting our ability to issue securities  pay dividends on our common stock or take other actions that affect our capitalization include covenants and other provisions in our credit or loan facilities and the credit facilities and receivables facility of our subsidiaries and other borrowing agreements  and limitations imposed on us as a registered public utility holding company under the act 
the collateralized term loan of centerpoint houston limits its debt  excluding transition bonds  as a percentage of its total capitalization to 
cerc corp 
s bank facility and its receivables facility limit cerc s debt as a percentage of its total capitalization to and contain an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to interest covenant 
cerc corp 
s bank facility also contains a provision that could  under certain circumstances  limit the amount of dividends that could be paid by cerc corp 
our billion revolving credit and term loan facility limits dividend payments as described above  contains a debt to ebitda covenant  an ebitda to interest covenant and restrictions on the use of proceeds from certain debt issuances and certain asset sales 
these facilities include certain restrictive covenants 
we and our subsidiaries are in compliance with such covenants 
we are a registered public utility holding company under the act 
the act and related rules and regulations impose a number of restrictions on our activities and those of our subsidiaries other than texas genco 
the act  among other things  limits our ability and the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to issue debt and equity securities without prior authorization  restricts the source of dividend payments to current and retained earnings without prior authorization  regulates sales and acquisitions of certain assets and businesses and governs affiliate transactions 
the june financing order is effective until june  additionally  we have received several subsequent orders which provide additional financing authority 
these orders establish limits on the amount of external debt and equity securities that can be issued by us and our regulated subsidiaries without additional authorization but generally permit us to refinance our existing obligations and those of our regulated subsidiaries 
each of us and our subsidiaries is in compliance with the authorized limits 
discussed below are the incremental amounts of debt and equity that we are authorized to issue after giving effect to our capital markets transactions in and the first two months of the orders also permit utilization of undrawn credit facilities at centerpoint energy and cerc 
as of march  centerpoint energy is authorized to issue an additional aggregate million of preferred stock  preferred securities and equity linked securities  million of debt and million shares of common stock  centerpoint houston is authorized to issue an additional aggregate million of debt and an aggregate million of preferred stock and preferred securities  and cerc is authorized to issue an additional million of debt and an additional aggregate million of preferred stock and preferred securities 
the sec has reserved jurisdiction over  and must take further action to permit  the issuance of million of additional debt at centerpoint energy  million of additional debt at cerc and million of additional debt at centerpoint houston 
the orders require that if we or any of our regulated subsidiaries issue securities that are rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro  the security to be issued must obtain an investment grade rating from at least one nrsro and  as a condition to such issuance  all outstanding rated securities of the issuer and of centerpoint energy must be rated investment grade by at least one nrsro 
the orders also contain certain requirements for interest rates  maturities  issuance expenses and use of proceeds 
the act limits the payment of dividends to payment from current and retained earnings unless specific authorization is obtained to pay dividends from other sources 
the sec has reserved jurisdiction over payment of million of dividends from centerpoint energy s unearned surplus or capital 
further authorization would be required to make those payments 
as of december   we had a retained deficit on our consolidated balance sheet 
we expect to pay dividends out of current earnings 
if as a result of the true up proceeding or any other event we are required to take a charge against our net income  our current earnings could be reduced below the level which would enable us to pay the quarterly dividend on our common stock under our current sec financing order 
we expect to file an application with the sec under the act requesting an order authorizing us  in the event that we are required to take such a charge against our net income  to pay quarterly dividends out of capital or unearned surplus 
the june financing order requires that centerpoint houston and cerc maintain a ratio of common equity to total capitalization of thirty percent 
security interests in receivables of reliant resources 
pursuant to a master power purchase and sale agreement as amended with a subsidiary of reliant resources related to power sales in the ercot market  texas genco has been granted a security interest in accounts receivable and or notes associated with the accounts receivable of certain subsidiaries of reliant resources to secure up to million in purchase obligations 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates 
accordingly  these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounting for rate regulation sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
 provides that rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected 
application of sfas no 
to the electric generation portion of our business was discontinued as of june  our electric transmission distribution business continues to apply sfas no 
which results in our accounting for the regulatory effects of recovery of stranded costs and other regulatory assets resulting from the unbundling of the transmission and distribution business from our electric generation operations in our consolidated financial statements 
certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
significant accounting estimates embedded within the application of sfas no 
with respect to our electric transmission distribution business segment relate to billion of recoverable electric generation plant mitigation assets stranded costs and billion of ecom true up as of december  the stranded costs include billion of previously recorded accelerated depreciation and million of previously redirected depreciation as well as million related to the texas genco distribution 
these stranded costs are recoverable under the provisions of the texas electric restructuring law 
the ultimate amount of stranded cost recovery is subject to a final determination  which will occur in  and is contingent upon the market value of texas genco 
any significant changes in our accounting estimate of stranded costs as a result of current market conditions or changes in the regulatory recovery mechanism currently in place could result in a material write down of these regulatory assets 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles we review the carrying value of our long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable  and annually for goodwill as required by sfas no 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market condition and material differences in the value of long lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows  regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
we have engaged a financial advisor to assist in exploring alternatives for monetizing our interest in texas genco  including possible sale of our ownership interest in texas genco 
as a result of our intention to monetize our interest in texas genco  we performed an impairment analysis of texas genco s assets as of december  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
as of december  no impairment had been indicated 
the fair value of our texas genco assets could be materially affected by a change in the estimated future cash flows for these assets 
we estimate future cash flows for texas genco using a probability weighted approach based on the fair value of its common stock  operating projections and estimates of how long we will retain these assets 
changes in any of these assumptions  including the timing of a possible sale  could result in an impairment charge 
unbilled energy revenues revenues related to the sale and or delivery of electricity or natural gas energy are generally recorded when energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
unbilled electric delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes  applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience 
unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes  estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
consequently  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates 
new accounting pronouncements see note n to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of changes in interest rates and energy commodity prices we are exposed to various market risks 
these risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and are inherent in our consolidated financial statements 
most of the revenues and income from our business activities are impacted by market risks 
categories of market risk include exposure to commodity prices through non trading activities  interest rates and equity prices 
a description of each market risk is set forth below commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and price volatilities of commodities  such as natural gas and other energy commodities risk 
interest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level of borrowings and changes in interest rates 
equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of individual equity securities 
management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks 
we manage these risk exposures through the implementation of our risk management policies and framework 
we manage our exposures through the use of derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instrument contracts 
during the normal course of business  we review our hedging strategies and determine the hedging approach we deem appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation 
derivative instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts  which are referred to as over the counter derivatives  and instruments that are listed and traded on an exchange 
derivative transactions are entered into in our non trading operations to manage and hedge certain exposures  such as exposure to changes in gas prices 
we believe that the associated market risk of these instruments can best be understood relative to the underlying assets or risk being hedged 
interest rate risk we have outstanding long term debt  bank loans  mandatory redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely our junior subordinated debentures trust preferred securities  securities held in our nuclear decommissioning trusts  some lease obligations and our obligations under our zero premium exchangeable subordinated notes due zens that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
in  we had interest rate swaps in place in order to hedge portions of our floating rate debt 
our floating rate obligations aggregated billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
if the floating interest rates were to increase by from december  rates  our combined interest expense would increase by a total of million each month in which such increase continued 
at december  and  we had outstanding fixed rate debt excluding indexed debt securities and trust preferred securities aggregating billion and billion  respectively  in principal amount and having a fair value of billion and billion  respectively 
these instruments are fixed rate and  therefore  do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from their levels at december  in general  such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if we were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
centerpoint houston contributed million in to trusts established to fund texas genco s share of the decommissioning costs for the south texas project 
in both and  centerpoint houston contributed million to these trusts 
the securities held by the trusts for decommissioning costs had an estimated fair value of million as of december   of which approximately were fixed rate debt securities that subject us to risk of loss of fair value with movements in market interest rates 
if interest rates were to increase by from their levels at december   the decrease in fair value of the fixed rate debt securities would be approximately million 
in addition  the risk of an economic loss is mitigated 
any unrealized gains or losses are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
as a regulatory asset liability because we believe that centerpoint houston s future contributions  which are currently recovered through the ratemaking process  will be adjusted for these gains and losses 
for further discussion regarding the recovery of decommissioning costs pursuant to the texas electric restructuring law  please read note a to our consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  upon adoption of sfas no 
effective january   the zens obligation was bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component 
the debt component of million at december  is a fixed rate obligation and  therefore  does not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of the debt component would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from levels at december  changes in the fair value of the derivative component  million at december   are recorded in our statements of consolidated operations and  therefore  we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the underlying risk free interest rate 
if the risk free interest rate were to increase by from december  levels  the fair value of the derivative component would increase by approximately million  which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated operations 
as of december   we had an interest rate swap having a notional amount of million to fix the interest rate applicable to floating rate debt 
at december   the swap could be terminated at a cost of million 
the swap  which expired in january  did not qualify as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
 and was marked to market in our consolidated balance sheets with changes reflected in interest expense in the statements of consolidated operations 
a decrease of in the december  level of interest rates would have no impact 
for information regarding the accounting for interest rate swaps  please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
equity market value risk we are exposed to equity market value risk through our ownership of million shares of tw common  which are held by us to facilitate our ability to meet our obligations under the zens 
please read note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effect of adoption of sfas no 
on our zens obligation and our historical accounting treatment of our zens obligation 
a decrease of from the december  market value of tw common would result in a net loss of approximately million  which would be recorded as a loss in our statements of consolidated operations 
as discussed above under interest rate risk  centerpoint houston contributes to trusts established to fund texas genco s share of the decommissioning costs for the south texas project  which held debt and equity securities as of december  the equity securities expose us to losses in fair value 
if the market prices of the individual equity securities were to decrease by from their levels at december   the resulting loss in fair value of these securities would be approximately million 
currently  the risk of an economic loss is mitigated as discussed above under interest rate risk 
commodity price risk from non trading activities to reduce our commodity price risk from market fluctuations in the revenues derived from the sale of natural gas and related transportation  we enter into forward contracts  swaps and options non trading energy derivatives in order to hedge some expected purchases of natural gas and sales of natural gas a portion of which are firm commitments at the inception of the hedge 
non trading energy derivatives are also utilized to fix the price of future operational gas requirements 
we use derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the commodity exposure inherent in our businesses 
the stand alone commodity risk created by these instruments  without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge  is described below 
we measure the commodity risk of our non trading energy derivatives using a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis performed on our non trading energy derivatives measures the potential loss in earnings based on a hypothetical movement in energy prices 
a decrease of in the market prices of energy commodities from their december  levels would have decreased the fair value of our non trading energy derivatives by million 
a decrease of in the market prices of energy commodities from their december  levels would have decreased the fair value of our non trading energy derivatives by million 
the above analysis of the non trading energy derivatives utilized for hedging purposes does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on our physical purchases and sales of natural gas to which the hedges relate 
furthermore  the non trading energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio  reducing overall risks within limits 
therefore  the adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of non trading energy derivatives held for hedging purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions  assuming the non trading energy derivatives are not closed out in advance of their expected term  the non trading energy derivatives continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk  and as applicable  anticipated underlying transactions settle as expected 
if any of the above mentioned assumptions ceases to be true  a loss on the derivative instruments may occur  or the options might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date  whichever comes first 
non trading energy derivatives designated and effective as hedges  may still have some percentage which is not effective 
the change in value of the non trading energy derivatives that represents the ineffective component of the hedges is recorded in our results of operations 
we have established a risk oversight committee  comprised of corporate and business segment officers  that oversees commodity price and credit risk activities  including trading  marketing  risk management services and hedging activities 
the committee s duties are to establish commodity risk policies  allocate risk capital  approve trading of new products and commodities  monitor risk positions and ensure compliance with the risk management policies and procedures and trading limits established by our board of directors 
our policies prohibit the use of leveraged financial instruments 
a leveraged financial instrument  for this purpose  is a transaction involving a derivative whose financial impact will be based on an amount other than the notional amount or volume of the instrument
