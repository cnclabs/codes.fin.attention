industry overview worldwide semiconductor industry sales were billion in  an increase of from we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by the world semiconductor trade statistics group to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the total market in the areas we provide semiconductor components 
the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market since year ended december  worldwide semiconductor industry sales percent change total addressable market sales percent change in billions in billions based on shipment information published by wsts  an industry research firm 
wsts collects this information based on product shipments  which is different from our revenue recognition policy as described in critical accounting policies revenue recognition contained elsewhere in this report 
we believe the data provided by wsts is reliable  but we have not independently verified it 
wsts periodically revises its information 
we assume no obligation to update such information 
our total addressable market comprises the following specific wsts product categories a discrete products all discrete semiconductors other than sensors  rf and microwave power transistors modules  rf and microwave diodes  rf and microwave ss transistors  power fet modules  igbt modules and optoelectronics  b standard analog products amplifiers  voltage regulators and references  comparators  assp consumer  assp computer  assp automotive and assp industrial and others  and c standard logic products general purpose logic and mos general purpose logic only 
although we categorize our products as power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components  wsts uses different product categories 
following the unprecedented semiconductor industry revenue declines of  the semiconductor industry began to show signs of stability in and grew more robust in worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew by in and in sales in our total addressable market grew by in and in  reflecting increases in volume and slowing rates of price declines during the latter part of the the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our total addressable market of approximately during through these are projections and may not be indicative of actual results 
other industry data also indicate that the market for our products has begun to expand after the recent and prolonged downturn 

table of contents business overview we classify our products broadly as power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components 
we design  manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products 
our power management semiconductor components control  convert  protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices 
our data management semiconductor components provide high performance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems 
our standard semiconductor components serve as building block components within virtually all electronic devices 
these various products fall into the logic  analog  and discrete categories used by wsts 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical 
during a down cycle  unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem  resulting in revenue declines 
in response to such declines  manufacturers have shut down production capacity 
when new applications or other factors have eventually caused demand to strengthen  production volumes have eventually stabilized and then grown again 
as market unit demand has reached levels above capacity production capabilities  shortages have begun to occur  which typically has caused pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers  thus prompting further capacity expansion 
such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand  which has triggered another similar cycle 
we believe we have entered into a cycle of rising volume and prices  as our manufacturing capacity utilization has increased to over  our book to bill ratio has exceeded in each quarter of and we have been able to selectively increase prices on some products where there are market shortages 
these recent trends are in sharp contrast to the last three years during which we had to consistently reduce our costs in order to generate sufficient cash flow to fund investments in new products and expand production capabilities in lower cost areas of the world 
cost savings and restructuring activities since the fourth quarter of  we have been implementing profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and as a result  we expect to rank  as compared to our primary competitors  among the lowest in terms of cost structure 
as a result of the elements of a program that we started in june and completed in the fourth quarter of the plan  we achieved approximately million of annualized cost savings  based on a comparison of our cost structure during the first quarter of to our cost structure during the third quarter of as a result of additional cost cutting commenced in the fourth quarter of  which was completed during the fourth quarter of the plan  we believe that we achieved an estimated million of cost savings in  as compared to our cost structure during the third quarter of  and we expect to achieve an estimated million of annual costs savings beginning in from the plan 
these savings are as a result of our manufacturing rationalization plan  reductions in non manufacturing personnel and other cost controls 
our manufacturing rationalization plan included movement of our manufacturing operations from high cost regions in north america to lower cost regions in asia and central europe 
as a result  approximately of our cost of goods sold in related to our manufacturing operations outside of north america 
more recently  we announced that we intend to phase out our manufacturing operations in east greenwich  ri and our assembly and test operations in the czech republic by the end of new product innovation as a result of the success of our research and development initiatives  we introduced new products in and new products in the primary emphasis of our new product development efforts is on power management and high frequency clock and data management solutions  which we expect to be among the highest 
table of contents margin product families within our portfolio 
the portion of our revenue attributable to new products has increased over the last three years  even though our overall revenue has declined during this period 
we define new product revenue as revenue from the sale of products that we have introduced in the three years prior to and during the period measured 
debt reduction and financing activities since we became an independent company as a result of our recapitalization  we have had relatively high levels of long term debt as compared to our principal competitors 
our long term debt includes significant amounts under our senior bank facilities  which contained minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio covenants with which we were not in compliance as of june  we obtained a waiver in respect of such non compliance and any future non compliance through and amended our senior bank facilities to make these covenants less restrictive through  however  in connection with such waiver and amendment  we added minimum cash and ebitda covenants and agreed to pay additional supplemental interest and obtain a million equity investment from our principal stockholder 
during and the first half of  we completed two debt refinancing transactions and further amended our senior bank facilities in connection therewith to extend a portion of our debt maturities  reduce the supplemental interest associated with our bank amendment and make the related financial covenants less restrictive on the whole 
we issued million principal amount of second lien senior secured notes due and million principal amount of first lien senior secured notes due  the net proceeds of which were used to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities 
we incurred million of offering expenses and increased our weighted average cost of borrowing as a result 
in addition  as part of the related amendments to our senior bank facilities  we converted million of our million revolving facility into a new term loan facility 
during the second half of  we began undertaking measures to reduce our long term debt  reduce the related interest costs and  in some cases  extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility 
in september  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share  the net proceeds of which were used to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities 
in connection with this offering  we amended our senior bank facilities to  among other things  extend the average maturity of the term loans through a refinancing of million of such loans and replace our million revolving facility with a new million revolving facility 
in november  we further amended our senior bank facilities to  among other things  reduce the interest rate on our outstanding term loans by 
in november  we extended the maturity of our million loan facility with a chinese bank for an additional three years under the same terms and conditions 
in december  we prepaid approximately million of loans under our senior bank facilities with the proceeds from a new loan facility with a chinese bank that bears interest at libor plus  as compared to libor plus under our senior bank facilities 
in february  we further reduced our long term debt as result of our sale of approximately million shares at a public offering price of per share  the net proceeds of which were used to redeem million principal amount of our first lien senior secured notes due and million principal amount of our second lien senior secured notes due at a redemption price of of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
the remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the offering we further amended our senior bank facilities to permit us to use the proceeds of this offering within days of completion to purchase  redeem or retire a portion of our senior subordinated notes due and our first lien senior secured notes and second lien senior secured notes 
the details of each of these financing events are outlined in the following sections

table of contents revenues revenues were  million   million and  million in  and  respectively 
the decline from to and from to were primarily due to declines in average selling prices of approximately and respectively  in each case partially offset by volume and mix changes 
as previously described  during and continuing through the first part of the decline in average selling prices was due to overcapacity and lower demand in the semiconductor industry 
the revenues by product line are as follows dollars in millions year ended december  as a of revenue year ended december  as a of revenue year ended december  as a of revenue power management and standard analog mos power devices high frequency clock and data management standard components revenues certain amounts may not total due to rounding of individual components although revenues from our power management and standard analog product line declined from to and from to  revenues in this product line as a percentage of total revenues increased from to as a result of our strategic focus of research and development and marketing efforts on the power management market 
in  weakness in the automotive sector has contributed to the absolute dollar and percentage declines in this product line 
revenues from mos power devices declined from to but increased in to exceed levels 
as a percentage of revenues  this product line grew in each of and  as compared to the previous year  primarily as a result of revenues from successful new product designs and strength in the computing sector 
revenues from high frequency clock and data management products declined substantially between and due to weakness in the networking sector driven by an excessive supply of routing and networking equipment 
in  this sector started to grow again primarily in the automated test equipment market  causing an increase in revenues both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
revenue from standard components declined steadily from to and from to this product line consists of many products that are available from numerous competitors in the marketplace and is thus heavily influenced by pricing pressures and general market conditions 
in addition  we took steps in to exit non profitable portions of this business  accounting for a portion of the revenue decline between and the revenue declines from to and from to are also partially attributable to our focus on other product lines during these periods 
revenues by geographic area as a percentage of revenues were as follows year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  americas asia pacific europe total 
table of contents a majority of our end customers  served directly or through distribution channels  are manufacturers of electronic devices 
in recent years  there has been a trend toward moving such manufacturing activities to lower cost regions  particularly in asia 
our shift in revenues by geographic area reflects this trend 
gross profit our gross profit was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  our gross margin was  and in  and  respectively 
although declines in average selling prices had a detrimental impact on our gross margin during and and reduced the need for inventory reserves in and  we were able to offset these effects through cost savings from our restructuring programs and the reduced need for inventory reserves in and since the fourth quarter of  we have been implementing profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and  as a result  we expect to rank  as compared to our primary competitors  among the lowest in terms of cost structure 
as a result of the elements of a program that we started in june and completed in the fourth quarter of the plan  we achieved approximately million of annualized cost savings of which million related to cost of sales  based on a comparison of our cost structure during the first quarter of to our cost structure during the third quarter of as a result of additional cost cutting commenced in the fourth quarter of  which was completed during the fourth quarter of the plan  we believe that we achieved an estimated million of cost savings in  as compared to our cost structure during the third quarter of  and we expect to achieve an estimated million of annual costs savings beginning in from the plan 
these savings are as a result of our manufacturing rationalization plan  reductions in non manufacturing personnel and other cost controls 
our manufacturing rationalization plan included movement of our manufacturing operations from high cost regions in north america to lower cost regions in asia and central europe 
as a result  approximately of our cost of goods sold in related to our manufacturing operations outside of north america 
more recently  we announced that we intend to phase out our manufacturing operations in east greenwich  ri and our assembly and test operations in the czech republic by the end of as a result of these actions  we expect to achieve modest savings in  as operations transition to other manufacturing facilities 
during  we expect cost savings related to these closures to be between million and million  as compared to annualized costs in the third quarter of the following table summarizes the annual cost savings from the plan by type and by the applicable caption contained in our consolidated statement of operations in millions reduced employee costs reduced depreciation other cost savings total cost of sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative the following table summarizes the estimated annual cost savings from the plan that we expect following by type of cost and by the applicable caption contained in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in millions reduced employee costs other cost savings total cost of sales general and administrative 
table of contents the actions taken to achieve the cost savings described above were centered around the following key initiatives  which we expect to continue to be a focus in consolidation of manufacturing sites to improve economies of scale  transfer of production to lower cost regions  increase die manufacturing capacity in a cost effective manner by moving production from to wafers and increasing the number of die per square inch  reduce the number of new product platforms and process flows  and  focus production on profitable product lines 
these plans have included  among other actions  phasing out manufacturing operations at our guadalajara  mexico facility and transferring some of the manufacturing activities performed at our aizu  japan and seremban  malaysia facilities to some of our other facilities or to third party contractors 
more recently  we announced that we intend to phase out our manufacturing operations in east greenwich  ri and our assembly and test operations in the czech republic by the end of in many cases  the volume from closed operations has been or is being shifted to our existing facilities in order to improve capacity utilization and take advantage of economies of scale 
facilities closures and production shifts have resulted in some reductions in our manufacturing capacity  but we do not expect these reductions to affect our ability to meet our foreseeable production needs 
operating expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million  representing  and of revenues in  and  respectively 
the primary emphasis of our new product development efforts has been  and continues to be  in the expected high growth market applications of power management and high frequency clock and data management solutions  with over of our overall research and development investments focused in these areas 
selling and marketing expenses were million  million and million  representing  and of revenues in  and  respectively 
restructuring efforts in selling and marketing  including the downsizing of our sales force  closing of sales offices as well as our regional sales headquarters and centralizing and relocating our order entry functions to lower cost regions  were largely enacted by the middle of internal sales and marketing personnel and field application engineers as well as external sales representatives promote our products 
we plan to make investments in our sales and marketing systems to identify new customers as well as to expand our penetration of existing customers in selected product areas 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  representing  and of revenues in  and  respectively 
personnel reductions of approximately and the relocation of functions to lower cost regions accounted for the majority of the decrease between and savings from these efforts  as well as continued personnel reductions and functional relocations  accounted for the further decrease between and based on our revenue estimates for and the fact that most of our cost savings in this area have been realized  we expect that any further decreases in general and administrative expenses would be modest and would be primarily attributable to our transition to new information technology platforms 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
effective january   we eliminated the amortization of goodwill see note significant accounting policies of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

table of contents interest expense interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase between and was attributable to the increased supplemental interest charges resulting from our august amendments to our senior bank facilities  and a full year of interest on the draw on our revolving credit facility that occurred in june this supplemental interest ceased to accrue at the end of march  however  the resulting interest savings was offset by our refinancing of portions of our senior bank facilities with higher interest rate bearing notes 
see liquidity and capital resources financing for a description of our refinancing activities 
our weighted average interest rate on long term debt including current maturities was  and per annum in  and  respectively 
loss on debt prepayment loss on debt prepayment totaled million and million in and  respectively  representing the write off of debt issuance costs and certain third party costs incurred with respect to debt refinancings that occurred during those periods 
see liquidity and capital resources financing for a description of our refinancing activities

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the and provisions related to income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations 
the amount was greatly influenced by our decision to reserve the deferred tax benefits relating to our domestic net operating losses to the amount that could be recovered via carry back 
this decision resulted in an increase of million in our valuation allowance that was partially offset by deferred tax benefits recognized for certain operating losses incurred outside the united states

in the normal course of our business  we enter into various operating leases for equipment including our mainframe computer system  desktop computers  communications  foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 
our other long term commitments consist of estimated payments relating to our us and foreign pension plans 
see note employee benefit plans of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
under our current assumptions  we expect pension expense to be approximately million over the remaining life of the us plan with a related cash funding requirement of

upon the termination of the us pension plan  we are under an obligation to ensure that the plan has assets sufficient to pay accrued benefits 
the remaining obligation in the table above also includes approximately million of estimated funding requirements for our foreign pension plans 
our series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock is redeemable at the holder s option anytime after september  the preferred stock has a cumulative dividend payable quarterly in cash  at the rate of per annum or  if greater during the relevant quarterly period  in an amount equal to the value of the dividends that would be paid on the common stock then issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock  compounded to the extent not paid  and subject to restrictions under the company s senior bank facilities  senior subordinated notes and other documents relating to the company s indebtedness 
the amount shown in the table above assumes no conversion of the preferred stock or redemption until the earliest redemption date of september  we are required to accrete the value of the preferred stock to its redemption value  and any resulting non cash charge would reduce net income applicable to common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share 
as a result  net income applicable to common stock may be reduced by any such non cash charges resulting from changes in the market price of our common stock 
for further information see note redeemable preferred stock of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million at december  we believe we have sufficient cash to meet our liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
our senior bank facilities include a million revolving facility 
letters of credit totaling million were outstanding under the revolving facility at december  we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility is less than million 
we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements 
some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to intellectual property infringement  property damage including environmental contamination  personal injury  failure to comply with applicable laws  our negligence or willful misconduct  or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 
we are a party to various agreements with motorola  a former affiliate  which were entered into in connection with our separation from motorola 
pursuant to these agreements  we have agreed to indemnify motorola for losses due to  for example  breach of representations and warranties and covenants  damages arising from assumed liabilities or relating to allocated assets  and for specified environmental matters 
our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount and payment by us is conditioned on motorola making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract  which procedures typically allow us to challenge motorola s claims 
we provide for indemnification of directors  officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements  certificates of incorporation  by laws  articles of association or similar organizational documents  as the case may be 
we maintain directors and officers insurance  which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
in addition to the above  from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisors and also provides indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 
while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification  other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to 
table of contents predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
sources and uses of cash we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements  including outlays for research and development  to make capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions and investments  and to pay debt service  including principal and interest and capital lease payments 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances 
in the near term  we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand  and targeted asset sales 
additionally  as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 
we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include factors that affect our results of operations and cash flows  including changes in demand for our products  competitive pricing pressures  effective management of our manufacturing capacity  our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses  the impact of our restructuring programs on our productivity  and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business  and factors that affect our access to bank financing and the debt and equity capital markets that could impair our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise  including interest rate fluctuations  our ability to maintain compliance with financial covenants under our existing credit facilities  and other limitations imposed by our credit facilities or arising from our substantial leverage 
our ability to service our long term debt  to remain in compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital  capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to  among other things  our future operating performance as well as to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  some of which may beyond our control 
if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations  we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives 
there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or  if available  will be at rates or prices acceptable to us 
we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash balances will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through december  to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely impacted 
operations our operational cash flows are affected by the ability of our operations to generate cash  and our management of our assets and liabilities  including both working capital and long term assets and liabilities 
each of these components is discussed herein ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a key indicator that management uses to evaluate our operating performance

this adjusted ebitda computation excludes certain restructuring and other charges and contains other differences from the ebitda as defined above 
therefore  ebitda in the above table is not representative of the adjusted ebitda used to determine our debt covenant compliance 
working capital working capital fluctuates depending on end market demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables  inventory and payables 
in times of escalating demand  our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing inputs and increase production 
our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs  which may require us to use cash for severance payments  asset transfers  and contract termination costs 
our working capital  including cash  was million at december   and has fluctuated within percent of this balance at quarter end for each of the last eight quarters 
the components of our working capital at december  and are set forth below  followed by explanations for changes between and that are greater than million december  change current assets cash and cash equivalents receivables  net inventories  net other current assets deferred income taxes total current assets current liabilities accounts payable accrued expenses income taxes payable accrued interest deferred income on sales to distributors current portion of long term debt total current liabilities net working capital the increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributable to an increase in sales during the last two months of as compared to the last two months of revenue growth could cause further growth in our receivable portfolio  unless such growth can be offset by reduced credit terms or improved collection rates 
the increase in inventory is attributable to an increase in production at the end of necessitated by increased backlog 
improved demand could cause a further increase in inventory if we expand production in response 
the decrease in other current assets in is primarily due to the accelerated settlement of certain value added tax vat amounts in europe and other claims as well as a reduction in prepaid items due to favorable vendor contract negotiations 
the increase in accounts payable in relates to our efforts to extend payment terms with our significant suppliers  as well as an increase in production at the end of continued growth in the semiconductor market could cause a reversal in this trend of extended payment terms as we compete with other semiconductor manufacturers for access to production materials 

table of contents the decrease in accrued expenses is attributable to a decrease in restructuring related reserves as we continue to make severance and contract termination payments  and the accelerated settlement of certain vat payables in europe described above 
the decrease in accrued interest is attributable to the payment of supplemental interest of million in the first quarter of of which a majority was outstanding at december   partially offset by accruals associated with our first lien senior secured notes interest payable semiannually in march and september  and prepayment of loans under of our senior bank facilities with the proceeds thereof 
the effect of this refinancing activity is further described in the financing activities below 
the decrease in current portion of long term debt relates to the effects of our refinancing activities as described in financing activities below 
long term assets and liabilities our long term assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  and capitalized debt issuance costs 
our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to efficiently utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently 
accordingly  we have reduced our capital expenditures during and we do not expect that our capital expenditure reductions will have a negative impact on our ability to service our customers  as we believe that near term access to additional manufacturing capacity  should it be required  could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  there was an excess supply of used semiconductor production equipment in the marketplace  and we were able to purchase additional equipment at discounted prices 
we will continue to look for opportunities to make similar strategic purchases in the future as we plan to invest approximately million in for additional capacity 
although our debt covenants contain certain restrictions that limit our amount of future capital expenditures  we do not believe that these restrictions will have a significant impact on our future operating performance 
our long term liabilities  excluding long term debt  consist primarily of liabilities under our foreign and domestic defined benefit pension plans 
our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum legal required amount in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate 
this annual amount is dependent upon many actuarial assumptions see note employee benefit plans to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
key financing events overview set forth below is a summary of the key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years 
since we became an independent company as a result of our recapitalization  we have had relatively high levels of long term debt as compared to our principal competitors 
our long term debt includes significant amounts under our senior bank facilities  which contained minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio covenants with which we were not in compliance as of june  we obtained a waiver in respect of such non compliance and any future non compliance through and amended our senior bank facilities to make these covenants less restrictive through  however  in connection with such waiver and amendment  we added minimum cash and ebitda covenants and agreed to pay additional supplemental interest and obtain a million equity investment from our principal stockholder 

table of contents during and the first half of  we completed two debt refinancing transactions and further amended our senior bank facilities in connection therewith to extend a portion of our debt maturities  reduce the supplemental interest associated with our bank amendment and make the related financial covenants less restrictive on the whole 
we issued million principal amount of second lien senior secured notes due and million principal amount of first lien senior secured notes due  the net proceeds of which were used to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities 
we incurred million of offering expenses and increased our weighted average cost of borrowing as a result 
in addition  as part of the related amendments to our senior bank facilities  we converted million of our million revolving facility into a new term loan facility 
during the second half of  we began undertaking measures to reduce our long term debt  reduce related interest costs and  in some cases  extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility 
in september  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share  the net proceeds of which were used to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities 
in connection with this offering  we amended our senior bank facilities to  among other things  extend the average maturity of the term loans through a refinancing of million of such loans and replace our million revolving facility with a new million revolving facility 
in november  we further amended our senior bank facilities to  among other things  reduce the interest rate on our outstanding term loans by 
in november  we extended the maturity of our million loan facility with a chinese bank for an additional three years under the same terms and conditions 
in december  we prepaid approximately million of loans under our senior bank facilities with the proceeds from a new loan facility with a chinese bank that bears interest at libor plus  as compared to libor plus under our senior bank facilities 
in the first quarter of  we expect to further reduce our long term debt as a result of the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds are expected to be used to redeem million principal amount of our first lien senior secured notes due and million principal amount of our second lien senior secured notes due at a redemption price of of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
the remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the offering we further amended our senior bank facilities to permit us to use the proceeds of this offering within days of completion to purchase  redeem or retire a portion of our senior subordinated notes due and our first lien senior secured notes and second lien senior secured notes

september waiver under senior credit facilities and issuance of convertible preferred stock to texas pacific group at june   we were not in compliance with minimum interest expense coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio covenants under our senior bank facilities 
on august   we received a waiver in respect of this noncompliance at june  and in respect of any future noncompliance with these covenants through december  in connection with this waiver  we amended our senior bank facilities to  among other things  reduce the minimum interest expense coverage requirement and increase the maximum leverage ratio requirement through december   add minimum cash and ebitda requirements through december   increase the required interest rate spreads applicable to outstanding borrowings referred to below as supplemental interest and change certain mandatory prepayment requirements 
as a condition to the waiver and amendment  we were required to obtain million through an equity investment from an affiliate of texas pacific group  our principal stockholder 
we satisfied this requirement on

see note long term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we used million of net cash proceeds from the sale of the second lien senior secured notes to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities 
because the remaining principal amount of loans outstanding under our senior bank facilities was reduced below million as a result of this refinancing  the supplemental interest charges thereon described in note long term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report were reduced from to

table of contents permit the redemption of up to of the senior secured first lien notes out of the net proceeds of equity offerings  and convert million of the outstanding loans under our revolving credit facility into a new tranche of term loans 
we used million of net cash proceeds from the sale of the notes to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities  including million of which proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and permanently reduce the commitments thereunder by such amount 
in connection with this refinancing  we wrote off million of debt issuance costs 
september public offering of common stock and amendment to senior bank facilities on september   we issued approximately million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds of the offering were million after deducting the underwriters discount of million and offering expenses of million  including million that were unpaid as of december  
we used the net proceeds to prepay million of our senior bank facilities and to fund million of costs associated with our amendment to our senior bank facilities  as described below

the loan facility is comprised of two million tranches 
the first tranche has a year term with a balloon payment due december  the second tranche has a three year term with scheduled principal payments through december  which is extendible for an additional three years under certain circumstances 
each tranche bears interest at a rate of libor plus per annum  payable quarterly as compared to libor plus under our senior bank facilities 
february public offering of common stock and amendment to senior bank facilities on february   we and our principal stockholder  texas pacific group  completed a public offering of common stock pursuant to which we issued approximately million shares at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately million after deducting the underwriters discounts of million and offering expenses of million

table of contents as of december   we were in compliance with the various covenants and other requirements contained in the credit agreement relating to our senior bank facilities and the indentures relating to our first lien senior secured notes due  second lien senior secured notes due and our senior subordinated notes due we believe that we will be able to comply with the various covenants and other requirements contained in such credit agreement and indentures through december  our debt agreements contain  and any future debt agreements may include  a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  including guarantees  incur liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  make investments  loans or advances  make some acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  make capital expenditures  pay dividends  redeem capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments  pay dividends from semiconductor components industries  llc to on semiconductor corporation  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  enter into new lines of business  issue some types of preferred stock  and enter into transactions with our affiliates 
in addition  our senior bank facilities require that we maintain or achieve a minimum consolidated adjusted ebitda  as defined  and a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents 
any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 
cash management our ability to manage cash is limited  as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements  contractual obligations  debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements 
while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases  we must invest in capital on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 
accounting changes during the second quarter of  we changed our method of accounting for net unrecognized actuarial gains or losses relating to our defined benefit pension obligations 
historically  we amortized our net unrecognized actuarial gains or losses over the average remaining service lives of active plan participants  to the extent that such net gains or losses exceeded the greater of of the related projected benefit obligation or plan assets 
effective january   we will no longer defer any actuarial gains or losses but will recognize such gains and losses during the fourth quarter of each year  which is the period our annual pension plan actuarial valuations are prepared 
we believe that this change is to a preferable accounting method as actuarial gains or losses will be recognized currently in income rather than being deferred 

table of contents the impact of this change for periods prior to january  was a charge of million or per share  both before and after income taxes  and has been reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations for the effect of the change in was to decrease the loss before cumulative effect of accounting change by million or per share  both before and after income taxes  and to increase the net loss by million or per share  both before and after income taxes 
absent the accounting change  the million of net unrecognized actuarial losses at december  would have been recognized as an operating expense in future periods 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill and require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized 
sfas no 
also requires that  upon adoption of sfas no 
 we reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill based on certain criteria 
sfas no 
primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas no 
prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and require that such assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired  require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill and remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
goodwill amortization expense totaled million in sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with the related carrying amount including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the reporting unit s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step test must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of such goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
our goodwill at january  totaled million and relates to the april acquisition of cherry semiconductor corporation cherry 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 we discontinued amortization of the cherry goodwill at the beginning of during the first quarter of  we identified our various reporting units  which correspond with our four product lines  and allocated our assets and liabilities to such reporting units 
the goodwill relating to the cherry acquisition was specifically identified with and included in our power management and standard analog reporting unit 
during the second quarter of  we completed the first step of its transitional goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair value of the power management and standard analog reporting unit as of january  exceeded the reporting unit s carrying amount by a substantial amount 
as a result  an impairment of the cherry goodwill as of that date was not indicated and completion of the second step test was not required 
we updated our goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of and and determined that a related impairment did not exist 
as mentioned below in critical accounting policies and estimates  effective january   we changed our accounting method for recognizing revenue on sales to distributors 
recognition of revenue and related gross profit on sales to distributors is now deferred until the distributor resells the product 
we believe that this change better aligns reported results with  focuses us on  and allows investors to better understand end user demand for 
table of contents the products that we sell through distributors 
our new revenue recognition policy is commonly used in the semiconductor industry 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change for periods prior to january  was a charge of million million  or per share  net of income taxes 
the accounting change resulted in an increase in revenues of million and a decrease in our net loss before cumulative effect of accounting change of million  or per share  for the year ended december  also effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which establishes standards for the accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
our interest rate swaps in effect at january  were designated as cash flow hedges  were measured at fair value and recorded as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded a charge of million to accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of january  this charge consisted of a million adjustment to record our interest rate swaps in the consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair values as well as the write off of an approximate million pretax deferred charge included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  relating to the payment made in december for the early termination of an interest rate protection agreement relating to a portion of the amounts outstanding under our senior bank facilities 
in addition to hedging a portion of our interest rate exposure  we use forward foreign currency contracts to reduce our overall exposure to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows 
the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities with gains and losses offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying assets or liabilities 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not impact our accounting and reporting for these derivative instruments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note significant accounting policies of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contain a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations 
we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue 
we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to original equipment manufacturers  electronic manufacturing service providers  and distributors 
we recognize revenue on sales to original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers when title passes to the customer net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances 
effective january   we changed our revenue recognition policy for distributor sales so that the related revenues are now deferred until the distributor resells the product to the end user 
this change eliminated the need to provide for estimated sales returns from distributors 
title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction  reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize the related revenue and margin when the distributor sells the products to the end user 
although payment terms vary  most distributor agreements require payment within days 
sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience 
given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products  our actual returns and allowances do not fluctuate significantly from period to period  and our returns and allowances provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 

table of contents inventories 
we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand 
projected end user demand is generally based on sales during the prior twelve months 
these provisions can influence our results from operations 
for example  when demand falls for a given part  all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved  impacting our cost of sales and gross profit 
if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold  we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin 
however  the vast majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded 
although we do sell some products that have previously been written down  such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 
deferred tax valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided  the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
in the fourth quarter of  a valuation allowance was established for our domestic deferred tax assets and a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets 
additionally  throughout and  no incremental domestic deferred tax benefits were recognized 
our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property  plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results 
we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset 
the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests 
in recent years  most of our assets that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned  sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities 
in some instances  these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value 
when material  these gains are recorded in the restructuring  asset impairment and other  net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
goodwill 
we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the reporting unit s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
to date  our goodwill has not been considered to be impaired based on the results of this first step 
defined benefit plans 
we maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees 
for financial reporting purposes  net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate for plan obligations  assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees 
all of these assumptions are based upon management s judgment  considering all known trends and uncertainties 
actual results that differ from these assumptions would impact the future expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans 

table of contents convertible redeemable preferred stock 
we account for the difference between the carrying amount of our convertible redeemable preferred stock and the redemption value by increasing the carrying amount for periodic accretion so that the carrying amount equals the redemption value at the earliest available redemption date 
the periodic accretion amount changes as our stock price changes and as additional dividends accrue 
based on the average closing price of our common stock over the last trading days preceding december  of  the accretion charge  in respect to the redemption feature  for the fourth quarter of was million 
for every one dollar increase in the average closing price used in the accretion calculation  the accretion charge we would record in the first quarter of will increase by approximately million 
contingencies 
we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
based on the available information  we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and estimable

all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
trends  risks and uncertainties related to our business we have experienced declines in revenues and operating losses  and we may experience additional declines in revenues and operating losses in the future 
our historical financial results have been  and our future financial results are anticipated to be subject to substantial fluctuations 
our revenues for were  million  compared to  million for and  million in this decline was due primarily to declines in the average selling prices for our products 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the most recent downturn in our business has been most pronounced with respect to our high frequency clock and data management products 
revenues from high frequency clock and data management products represented million  million and million  or  and of the total revenues  in  and  respectively 
reduced end user demand  continued price declines  excess inventory  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business in the near term and we may experience additional declines in revenue and operating losses in the future 
in order to return to profitability  we must successfully implement our business plan  including our cost reduction initiatives 
however  we also currently face an environment of uncertain demand and pricing pressure in the markets our products address 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to return to profitability or that we will be able to sustain our profitability  if achieved 

table of contents we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry  which is subject to significant downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
the industry has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the end user products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience such downturns in the future 
the most recent downturn  which began in the fourth quarter of  was severe and prolonged  and it is uncertain whether recent improvements in semiconductor industry performance will continue or whether such improvements will benefit us to the same extent as they benefit other industry participants 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry may also be severe and prolonged 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry  or any failure of the industry to fully recover from its recent downturn  could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the s and continuing into  the semiconductor industry enjoyed unprecedented growth  benefiting from the rapid expansion of the internet and other computing and communications technologies 
during  we like many of our customers and competitors were adversely affected by a general economic slowdown and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the end user products that incorporate our integrated circuits and standard semiconductors 
the terrorist attacks of september  also further depressed economic activity and demand for end user products 
the impact of slowing end customer demand was compounded by higher than normal levels of equipment and component inventories among our original equipment manufacturer  subcontractor and distributor customers  resulting in increasing pricing pressure 
we expect that factors including  but not limited to  economic uncertainty and downturns relating to the threat or actual occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks  reduced demand for end user products  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and changes in our revenue mix could adversely impact our operating results in the near term 
our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors  including our level of capacity utilization 
semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment  leading to high fixed costs  including depreciation expense 
if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 
the decline in product orders and shipments in resulted in reduced capacity utilization of our facilities as we have attempted to match production with anticipated customer demand 
as a percentage of revenues  gross margin was for  compared to for and in although our gross margin as a percent of revenues improved between and  gross margin declined sequentially in the fourth quarter of  the first quarter of and the third quarter of  in each case as a result of pricing pressure 
increased competition and other factors may lead to further price erosion  lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 
the failure to implement  as well as the completion and impact of  our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business 
between and the end of  we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives in response to the significant downturn in our industry 
these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions  transitioning higher cost external supply to internal manufacturing  working with our material suppliers to further lower costs  personnel reductions  reductions in employee compensation  temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead 
however  we cannot assure you that these cost reduction initiatives will  in and of themselves  return us to profitability 
we recorded restructuring charges of million in  million in and million in to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives 
these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments 
the impact of these restructuring actions on our ability to 
table of contents compete effectively is subject to risks and uncertainties 
because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business  the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated 
even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings  there may be other unforeseeable factors that could adversely impact our profitability and business 
if we are unable to implement our business strategy  our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes  without limitation  plans to maintain and refine our product portfolio  continue to develop leading edge customer support services  expand further our just in time delivery capabilities  increase our die manufacturing capacity in a cost effective manner  reduce further the number of our product platforms and process flows  continue to manage our existing portfolio of products aggressively  rationalize our manufacturing operations  relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions  reduce selling and administrative expenses  reduce capital expenditures  actively manage working capital  develop new products in a more efficient manner  and focus on the development of power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management products 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations 
in particular  we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential  increase our volume or revenue  rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 
our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably 
each of these factors depends on our ability  among other things  to finance our operating and product development activities  maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations  relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations  access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a cost effective and timely manner  protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and finance personnel 
several of these and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy  such as risks associated with international operations  the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities  increased competition  legal developments and general economic conditions  are beyond our control 
in addition  circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 
we may require additional capital in the future  and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  together with the cash that we expect to generate from our operations and sales of assets in the ordinary course of business  will be sufficient to meet our planned capital needs for the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to fund our future activities or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
as of march   we have million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility 
subject to the restrictions contained in our senior bank facilities and the indentures governing our first lien senior secured notes due  our second lien senior secured notes due and our senior subordinated notes due  we may be able to raise these funds by selling securities to the public or selected investors  or by borrowing money 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly  reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development  make selective dispositions of our assets or obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets  or otherwise impair our ability to remain competitive 

table of contents we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 
the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products 
we are committed to maintaining spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 
the primary emphasis of our new product development is in the power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management solutions  with over of our overall research and development investment targeted in these areas 
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of  and payment for  our products could adversely affect our business 
our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers 
generally  our customers may cancel orders days prior to shipment without incurring significant penalty 
we routinely purchase inventory based on customers estimates of demand for their products  which is difficult to predict 
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers  or both  as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 
during  the markets in which our customers operate were characterized by a dramatic decline in end user demand and continued high levels of channel inventories  which reduced visibility of future demand for our products and  in some cases  led to delays or defaults in payments for our products 
in and the first half of  short customer lead times prevailed given the over capacity in the industry 
these and other factors adversely affected our revenues during this period 
an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us  and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 
rapidly changing technologies and industry standards  along with frequent new product introductions  characterize the industries that are currently the primary end users of semiconductors 
as these industries evolve and introduce new products  our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and cost effective manner by designing  developing  manufacturing  marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and end users and adapt to such changes in a timely and cost effective manner 
nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or end users could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 
the semiconductor industry  particularly the market for semiconductor components  is highly competitive 
as a result of the recent economic downturn  competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified as manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production 
table of contents overcapacity and high inventory levels 
although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines  we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches 
in addition  companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 
the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness 
many of our competitors may have certain advantages over us  including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products  longer independent operating histories and presence in key markets  patent protection  and greater name recognition 
because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits  we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits  application specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits  as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 
we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price  quality  technical performance  product features  product system compatibility  customized design  strategic relationships with customers  new product innovation  availability  delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support 
gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used  such as personal computers  industrial and telecommunications equipment  consumer electronics and automotive goods 
our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control  including industry and general economic trends 
unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency  our future profitability could be adversely affected 
manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
from time to time  we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities  transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  transferring production to other facilities  upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues 
our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 
we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing technology and equipment to remain competitive 
in view of industry conditions in recent years  we reduced our capital expenditures from million in  to million in in  however  our capital expenditures totaled million 
we may be required to increase our future capital expenditures to meet increased demand 
semiconductor manufacturing has historically required  and in the future is likely to continue to require  a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive  as new and enhanced semiconductor processes 
table of contents are developed which permit smaller  more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices 
we maintain certain of our own manufacturing  assembly and test facilities  which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
in addition  our principal credit agreement limits the amount of our capital expenditures 
if we were to lose one of our large customers  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
product sales to our ten largest customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
many of our customers operate in cyclical industries  and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered 
generally  our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products 
we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services  or increases in the prices of such goods or services  could adversely affect our operations and productivity 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates 
our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials  including silicon wafers  copper lead frames  mold compound  ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases 
generally  our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations  and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a just in time basis 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate  shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 
in addition  for some of our products  such as our new silicon germanium sige technology  we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials 
the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited 
we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules 
disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 
we also use third party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities  primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods 
these contract manufacturers  including amkor  psi  ait  ase  kec  hynix  liteon  chartered and phenitec  accounted for approximately  and of our cost of sales in  and  respectively 
our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts  and in some cases require longer term commitments in the early stages of the relationship 
our operations could be adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated  the cost of such services increased significantly  the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect 
in the case of motorola  we agreed to continue providing manufacturing services to each other including motorola s manufacturing of our emitter coupled logic products for limited periods of time following our 
table of contents recapitalization 
under our agreements with motorola  the prices of these services are fixed at levels that are intended to approximate each party s cost of providing the services 
we fulfilled our minimum commitments to purchase manufacturing services from motorola in we could be adversely affected if we are unable to relocate these manufacturing operations to our own facilities or to other third party manufacturers on cost effective terms or make other satisfactory arrangements prior to the time when these agreements expire 
acquisitions and strategic alliances may harm our operating results or cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities or dilute our stockholders 
we may in the future acquire and form strategic alliances relating to other businesses  products and technologies 
successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require  among other things  efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
the difficulties of integration and alignment may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  the complexity of the technologies being integrated and aligned and the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
the integration and alignment of operations following an acquisition or alliance requires the dedication of management resources that may distract attention from the day to day business  and may disrupt key research and development  marketing or sales efforts 
in addition  we may issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances  which could be dilutive to existing stockholders 
we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances  which could harm our operating results 
without strategic acquisitions and alliances we may have difficulty meeting future customer product and service requirements 
our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 
approximately  and of our total revenues in and  and of our total revenues in were derived from the americas  the asia pacific region and europe including the middle east  respectively 
we maintain significant operations in seremban  malaysia  carmona  the philippines  aizu  japan  leshan  china  roznov  the czech republic  and piestany  the slovak republic 
in addition  we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asia pacific region 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets 
risks inherent in doing business on an international level include  among others  the following economic and political instability including as a result of the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  transportation delays  power supply shortages and shutdowns  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other labor problems  currency convertibility and repatriation  taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel  and other risks relating to the administration of or changes in  or new interpretations of  the laws  regulations and policies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
our activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates  hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange 
while our sales are 
table of contents primarily denominated in us dollars  worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 
if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 
our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and finance personnel 
the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive 
for example  analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain  and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components 
we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel 
as employee incentives  we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting 
at times  our stock price has declined substantially  reducing the effectiveness of these incentives 
loss of the services of  or failure to effectively recruit  qualified personnel  including senior managers and design engineers  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business 
some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties  and litigation could arise in the future 
if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use  our business could be adversely affected 
we rely on patents  trade secrets  trademarks  mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies 
some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications  and we cannot assure you that any of the substantial number of us and foreign patents and pending patent applications that we employ in our business  including those that motorola assigned  licensed or sublicensed to us in connection with our recapitalization  will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  abandoned or licensed to others  the license rights granted by motorola in connection with our recapitalization will provide competitive advantages to us  any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought  any of the trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  know how or mask works that motorola has assigned  licensed or sublicensed to us in connection with our recapitalization will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  abandoned or licensed to others  or any of our pending or future trademark  copyright  or mask work applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought 
in addition  our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies  duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable  limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 
also  we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing third party patents or other intellectual property rights 
motorola has agreed to indemnify us for a limited period of time with respect to some claims that our activities infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
if necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies 
litigation could cause us to incur significant expense  by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or 
table of contents technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor 
in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation  we may be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use  sale or importation of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies  discontinue the use of processes  or obtain licenses to the infringing technologies 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms 
any such development  acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 
we will also seek to protect our proprietary technologies  including technologies that may not be patented or patentable  in part by confidentiality agreements and  if applicable  inventors rights agreements with our collaborators  advisors  employees and consultants 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 
we are party to securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 
in july  three stockholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us  certain of our former officers  current and former directors and various investment banking firms who acted as underwriters in connection with our initial public offering in may in april  the plaintiffs filed a consolidated  amended complaint that supercedes the individual complaints originally filed 
the amended complaint generally alleges that our offering documents failed to disclose certain underwriting fees and commissions and underwriter tie ins and other arrangements with certain customers of the underwriters that impacted the price of our common stock in the after market 
the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages 
on july   together with other issuer defendants  we filed a collective motion to dismiss the class action lawsuit 
on february   as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws  the court dismissed these claims with prejudice 
as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws  the court denied the motion to dismiss these claims 
in addition  the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the current and former directors and officers who were named as individual defendants in the litigation 
in june  upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors  we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation 
formal settlement documents for submission to the court are currently being drafted 
if this proposed settlement is ultimately finalized and then submitted to and approved by the court  it would result in a dismissal  with prejudice  of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elect to participate in the proposed settlement  together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this securities litigation 
any conclusion of this litigation in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the cost to us of defending the litigation  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of this litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace 
because the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile  we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future 

table of contents environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water 
our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health  which  among other things  regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances 
motorola has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola s ownership  occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our recapitalization 
we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances 
however  we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs 
in addition  the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities related to events or activities occurring after our recapitalization 
based on information currently available to us  we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  and any liability for currently known environmental conditions  will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
however  we cannot predict changes in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations  the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced  administered or interpreted  our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities  or the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims  including the cost of clean up of currently unknown environmental conditions 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington dc on september   or threats or occurrences of international armed conflict or other terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
on september  the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope 
the threat or occurrences of international armed conflict or other terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the market in which we operate and our profitability 
the terrorist attacks have caused instability in the global financial markets and future or threatened terrorist attacks or occurrences of international armed conflict could result in greater economic instability 
warranty claims  product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury or property damage or both 
in addition  if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in their recall 
as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design  original equipment manufacturers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls 
a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established 
table of contents reserves  or a requirement that we participate in a product recall  would have adverse effects that could be material on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
trends  risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations 
as of december   we had total long term indebtedness of  million including current maturities  but excluding unused commitments and interest expense of million for the year ended december  also  we may incur additional debt in the future  subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to you  including our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our debt  which reduces the funds available to us for our operations  some of our debt is and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates  our debt agreements contain  and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain  financial and restrictive covenants  and our failure to comply with them may result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us  our level of indebtedness will increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions  our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the semiconductor industry  and our substantial leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage vis vis our competitors who have less leverage relative to their overall capital structures 
we may incur more debt  which could exacerbate the risks described above 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness  but do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so 
if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels  the related risks that we and they now face could intensify 
some of the debt we may incur may be secured by the same collateral securing certain of our existing indebtedness 
the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 
our debt agreements contain  and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  including guarantees  incur liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  make investments  loans or advances  
table of contents make some acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  make capital expenditures  pay dividends  redeem capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments  pay dividends from semiconductor components industries  llc to on semiconductor corporation  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  enter into new lines of business  issue some types of preferred stock  and enter into transactions with our affiliates 
in addition  our senior bank facilities require that we maintain or achieve a minimum consolidated ebitda and a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents 
any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 
our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness  including as a result of events beyond our control  could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 
if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately 
we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments  either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or  if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control  that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities 
further  if we are unable to repay  refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt  the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness 
in addition  any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments  including the notes 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling additional assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
the terms of our financing agreements contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
as of march   we have million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility 
as of january   we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility is less than million 
we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible  that any assets could be sold  or  if sold  of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales  or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all  or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

table of contents trends  risks and uncertainties related to our common stock fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability  and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations 
a large portion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter 
factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include the timing and size of orders from our customers  including cancellations and reschedulings  the timing of introduction of new products  the gain or loss of significant customers  including as a result of industry consolidation  seasonality in some of our target markets  changes in the mix of products we sell  changes in demand by the end users of our customers products  market acceptance of our current and future products  variability of our customers product life cycles  changes in manufacturing yields or other factors affecting the cost of goods sold  such as the cost and availability of raw materials and the extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity  changes in the prices of our products  which can be affected by the level of our customers and end users demand  technological change  product obsolescence  competition  or other factors  cancellations  changes or delays of deliveries to us by our third party manufacturers  including as a result of the availability of manufacturing capacity and the proposed terms of manufacturing arrangements  our liquidity and access to capital  and our research and development activities and the funding thereof 
holders of our common stock may experience dilution and the price of our common stock may decline as a result of the issuance of stock in the future 
in september  we sold  shares of our series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock to tpg on holdings llc  an affiliate of the texas pacific group 
each share of preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder into approximately  shares of our common stock as of the issue date  excluding shares into which the preferred stock is convertible due to accumulated and unpaid dividends and subject to customary anti dilution adjustments 
under the anti dilution provisions  the conversion price is subject to downward adjustment in the event we issue common stock  or derivative securities entitling the holder to subscribe for or acquire common stock  at a price below the then current conversion price or market price 
holders of preferred stock are entitled to cumulative dividends  payable quarterly in cash  at a rate of per annum or if greater during the relevant quarterly period  in an amount equal to the value of the dividends that would be paid on our common stock then issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock  subject to applicable restrictions imposed by our principal credit facility 
in the event dividends are not paid  the dividends will accumulate on a compounded basis and the number of shares of common stock into which the preferred stock is convertible will increase proportionately 
there is a possibility that the preferred stock will be converted at a price per share that is less than the then current market price of our common stock 
if this were to occur  it may cause substantial dilution to our existing common stockholders 
additionally  we registered the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 
table of contents preferred stock under the securities act for public resale 
therefore  in the event that the preferred stock is converted  a substantial number of shares of our common stock may be sold into the market  which could decrease the trading price of our common stock and encourage short sales by the selling shareholder or others 
short sales could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock 
in addition to the preferred stock  we may issue more stock in the future  which may cause dilution and a decline in the price of our common stock 
our stock price may be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 
the stock markets in general  and the markets for high technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  changes in market valuations of similar companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  capital commitments  new products or product enhancements  loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions  and additions or departures of key personnel 
as of march   the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has ranged from a high of on may  to a low of on october  tpg  as our principal stockholder  controls our company  which will limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters submitted for a vote of the stockholders 
affiliates of texas pacific group own  shares of our common stock and  shares of series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock 
as of march   these shares represented over of the total voting power of our capital stock 
as a result  texas pacific group  through its affiliates  will be able to elect all of our directors and  as a result  control matters requiring board approval  control matters submitted to a stockholder vote  including mergers and consolidations with third parties and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets  and otherwise control or influence our business direction and policies 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation provides that the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which relate to business combinations with interested stockholders  do not apply to us 
provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company  which could decrease the value of our stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions create a board of directors with staggered terms  permit only our board of directors or the chairman on our board of directors to call special meetings of stockholders  
table of contents establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock  which is preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and that our board of directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval  and require the approval by holders of at least of our outstanding common stock to amend any of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws 
although we believe these provisions make a higher third party bid more likely by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
at december   our long term debt including current maturities totaled  million 
we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt  which totaled million 
we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt  however  from time to time  we have entered into interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap to reduce this exposure 
as of december   we had an interest rate swap covering million of our variable interest rate debt 
a basis point increase in interest rates would not materially change our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months 
a majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  as a multinational business  we also conduct certain of these activities through transactions denominated in a variety of other currencies 
we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge firm commitments and reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows 
gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments 
this strategy reduces  but does not eliminate  the short term impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
for example  changes in exchange rates may affect the foreign currency sales price of our products and can lead to increases or decreases in sales volume to the extent that the sales price of comparable products of our competitors are less or more than the sales price of our products 
our policy prohibits speculation on financial instruments  trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures  or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure
