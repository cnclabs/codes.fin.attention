recognition of franchise related revenue initial franchise revenue is recognized when our company has performed substantially all of its obligations as franchisor 
franchise royalties are recognized when earned as promulgated in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for franchise fee revenue 
franchise related revenue consists of royalty revenue and franchise fees  which include initial franchise fees and area development fees 
franchise related revenue for fiscal was approximately million  a increase when compared to franchise related revenue of approximately million for the same period in  primarily reflecting increased royalties 
royalties  which are based on a percent of net sales  increased  reflecting the annualization of franchise restaurants that opened in fiscal in addition to the franchise restaurants opened during fiscal there were franchise operated restaurants open at december   compared to at december  during fiscal  we expect to realize higher franchise related revenue from company owned restaurants sold to a franchise partner in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition to the opening of to new franchise restaurants throughout fiscal asset impairment and restructuring charges in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate restaurant sites and long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of restaurant sites to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the restaurant site to its fair value  as determined by the discounted future net cash flows expected to be generated on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
any impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the restaurant site exceeds its fair value 
restaurant sites to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value on a restaurant by restaurant basis  less estimated costs to sell 
our december  consolidated balance sheet reflects approximately million of assets held for sale  which include the land and building for our mesquite location that was recently closed 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment and restructuring charges of approximately million related to five units  two of which were subsequently closed and two of which were subsequently sold to a franchisee 
no asset impairment charges were recorded on company owned units during fiscal or fiscal deferred tax asset deferred taxes recognize the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recorded for financial statement purposes and such amounts measured in accordance with tax laws 
realization of the net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax temporary differences are contingent on future taxable earnings 
during fiscal  our deferred tax asset was reviewed for expected utilization using a more likely than not approach as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  by assessing the available positive and negative evidence surrounding its recoverability 
we believe that the realization of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not based on the expectations that our company will generate the necessary taxable income beginning in fiscal results of operations revenue our revenue consists of restaurant sales  franchise related revenue and licensing and other revenue 
our franchise related revenue is comprised of area development fees  initial franchise fees  and continuing royalty payments 
our area development fee consists of a non refundable payment equal to  per unit upon the signing of the area development agreement 
since the fee to secure the territory is non refundable  we recognize this fee upon receipt 
our initial franchise fee is typically  per restaurant  of which  is recognized immediately when a franchise agreement is signed and the remaining  is recognized upon either the signing of a lease or upon receipt of a builder s permit  and at which time we have substantially performed all of our services 
franchise royalties are equal to a percentage of weekly net sales  currently at 
licensing revenue includes royalties from a retail line of business  including sauces and seasonings 
other revenue includes opening assistance and training we provide to our franchise partners 
comparable sales represent net sales for restaurants open year round for months or more 
costs and expenses components of operating expenses include food and beverage costs  operating payroll and employee benefits  occupancy costs  repair and maintenance costs  supplies and advertising and promotion 
certain of these costs are variable and will increase with sales volume 
the primary fixed costs are corporate and restaurant management and occupancy costs 
our experience is that when a new restaurant opens  it incurs higher than normal levels of labor and food costs until operations stabilize  usually during the first three months of operation 
as restaurant management and staff gain experience following the opening  labor scheduling  food cost management and operating expense control are improved to levels similar to those at our more established restaurants 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that provide an infrastructure to support existing operations and support future growth 
salaries  employee benefits  legal fees  consulting fees  travel  rent  depreciation  general insurance and marketing expenses are major items in this category 
a breakdown of our restaurant and total company operating results were as follows amounts in s restaurant operations fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year restaurant sales  net    restaurant costs and expenses food and beverage costs    labor and benefits    operating expenses    depreciation and amortization    total costs and expenses    income from restaurant operations    total company fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year total revenue    total costs and expenses food and beverage costs    labor and benefits    operating expenses    depreciation and amortization    asset impairment and restructuring charges  pre opening expenses  general and administrative    loss income from total company operations   fiscal year compared to fiscal year total revenue total revenue of approximately million for fiscal increased million or over revenues of approximately million for fiscal restaurant sales restaurant sales increased by approximately million or to approximately million for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year the increase in sales was due primarily to the annualization of sales on restaurants that opened late in as well as our openings 
franchise related revenue franchise related revenue consists of royalty revenue and franchise fees  which include initial franchise fees and area development fees 
franchise related revenue for fiscal were approximately million  a increase when compared to approximately million for the same period in  primarily reflecting increased royalties 
royalties  which are based on a percent of net sales  increased  reflecting the annualization of franchise restaurants that opened in fiscal in addition to the franchise restaurants opened during fiscal there were franchise operated restaurants open at december   compared to at december  during fiscal  we expect to realize higher franchise related revenue from three company owned restaurants sold to a franchise partner in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition to the opening of to new franchise restaurants throughout fiscal licensing and other revenue licensing revenue includes royalties from a retail line of business  including sauces  seasonings and prepared meats 
other revenue includes opening assistance and training we provide to our franchise partners 
for fiscal year  the licensing royalty income was  flat to fiscal during fiscal  we expect to see licensing revenue remain relatively flat  due to the elimination of the refrigerated segment of our business  offset by continued market penetration of our sauces and seasonings 
the amount of other revenue will be dependent on the level of opening assistance we will be required to provide during franchise openings 
same store net sales it is our policy to include in our same store net sales base  restaurants that are open year round and have been open for at least months 
at the end of fiscal  there were restaurants included in this base 
same store net sales for fiscal decreased approximately  compared to fiscal s decrease of approximately 
we believe that the decrease in same store net sales reflects our decision  during the third quarter of fiscal  to eliminate routine discounting throughout our company owned restaurants 
although discounting during fiscal had increased restaurant traffic  the majority of the incremental sales derived had substantially lower margins 
we believe that the decision to discontinue discounting was the right decision to protect our brand for the long term 
same store net sales are expected to continue to remain soft  at a minimum  through the second quarter of average weekly net sales weighted average weekly net sales for our company owned and franchise operated restaurants during fiscal were  and  respectively 
during fiscal  weighted average weekly net sales for our company owned and franchise operated restaurants were  and  respectively 
food and beverage costs food and beverage costs for fiscal were approximately million or of net restaurant revenue compared to approximately million or of net restaurant revenue for fiscal the improvement primarily reflects a favorable pork contract and the improved pricing we received 
approximately of our purchases are on contract 
contracts negotiated for overall  however  have resulted in less favorable pricing 
our pork contract renewal resulted in a contracted price increase in pork products 
in addition  we recently renewed our poultry and hamburger contracts  which resulted in a price increase in poultry and a increase in hamburger 
our brisket contract renews in july and we are watching the beef market closely 
as a result of the above negotiations  we anticipate that food costs  as a percent of net restaurant revenues  will increase approximately basis points for fiscal over the prior year 
we believe that we have an opportunity to mitigate the impact that the recently renewed food contracts have on our margin 
in we will focus on increasing our adult beverage sales  which are currently of our dine in sales and on average carry basis points higher margin than food 
we are currently working with a consultant that is assisting us in developing this program  which we are expecting to roll out during the second quarter of fiscal labor and benefits labor and benefits at the restaurant level were approximately million or of net restaurant revenue in fiscal compared to approximately million or of net restaurant revenue in fiscal the increase in labor and benefits as a percentage of restaurant revenue reflects a increase in benefits costs  partially offset by a lower level of bonus payout at the restaurant level 
full service restaurants that operate in states without a tip credit such as minnesota experience a higher wage rate for dining room labor than do restaurants located in states where a tip credit is available to reduce wages paid to food servers 
the migration toward full service dining in the majority of our restaurants is part of our strategy for increasing unit level revenue  but may result in higher labor costs 
during fiscal  we are expecting labor and benefits as a percentage of net revenues to remain relatively flat to fiscal operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal were approximately million or of net restaurant revenue  compared to approximately million or of net restaurant revenue for fiscal the increase in operating expenses reflects significant investments made at the restaurant level to upgrade and repair stores that had been neglected  in addition to higher utilities related to increased gas pricing 
repair and maintenance costs for fiscal year were million compared to  for fiscal the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant revenue for fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to lower average restaurant revenues against slightly higher fixed costs 
during fiscal  operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues are expected to decrease from the percentage in fiscal  primarily due to lower levels of repairs and maintenance costs and further leverage of fixed costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for fiscal was approximately million  or of total revenue  compared to approximately million  or of total revenue for fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization reflects investments in store openings  restaurant level enhancements  catering vehicles and continuing investments in information systems 
during fiscal  depreciation and amortization is expected to remain relatively flat to fiscal levels as depreciation from asset additions are offset by assets that will be fully depreciated during fiscal asset impairment and restructuring charges during fiscal we recorded asset impairment and restructuring charges equal to approximately million on five restaurant locations  two of which were subsequently sold and two of which were subsequently closed 
as of december   we had approximately million of assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet related to one of the restaurants in texas that was closed 
pre opening expenses pre opening expenses were  or of total revenue for fiscal compared to approximately million or of total revenue for fiscal these expenses reflect the opening of three restaurants during fiscal as compared with eight in fiscal we do not anticipate opening any company owned restaurants during fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses totaled million or of total revenue in fiscal compared to million or of total revenue in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses reflects severance and recruiting costs related to changes in management and additions at the board level  consulting expenses associated with the development of our media plan and our new smoke house prototype and increases in the corporate infrastructure to support system wide restaurant growth 
during fiscal  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase both in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue due to investments in the corporate infrastructure to support the growth in franchise operations in addition to our company owned restaurant base 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  totaled million or of total revenue for fiscal compared to million or of total revenue for fiscal this line item represents interest expense from capital lease obligations  notes payable and financing lease obligations 
the increase in expense from fiscal to fiscal is the result of lower capitalization of construction period interest on fewer openings in than in as a result of no anticipated openings of company owned restaurants for fiscal  in addition to our levels of fixed rate debt  for fiscal  we are expecting interest expense to remain flat to fiscal levels 
other expense  net other expense  net of approximately  reflects losses related to expenses of an unopened site and early extinguishments of debt associated with the early payoff of a note  partially offset by gains attributable to the sale of three units in georgia to a franchisee 
in comparison  during fiscal we realized other income of approximately  related to the gains attributable to the sale of three units in wisconsin to a franchisee

pursuant to an agreement governing the joint venture  the participants in the joint venture formed a delaware limited liability company named fumume  llc 
on february   we disposed of our interest in fumume  llc 
the equity in loss from unconsolidated affiliate was million for fiscal  reflecting losses in the isaac hayes blues clubs  in addition to transaction costs associated with our divestiture of those clubs 
we are no longer participating in any revenue or expenses of the joint venture and we do not have any further obligations with regard to the joint venture

this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
the changes in this statement will result in a more complete depiction of an entity s liabilities and equity and will  thereby  assist investors and creditors in assessing the amount  timing  and likelihood of potential future cash outflows and equity share issuances 
reliability of accounting information will be improved by providing a portrayal of an entity s capital structure that is unbiased  verifiable  and more representational than information reported prior to issuance of this statement 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we currently do not have instruments impacted by the adoption of this statement and therefore the adoption did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  and addresses consolidation of business enterprises of variable interest entities 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created or obtained after january  and it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  during fiscal we sold of our atlanta stores to a franchisee  and recorded a note receivable for approximately million 
we reviewed the transaction in accordance with fin  and determined that we did not have a variable interest entity that would require consolidation under fin on july   president bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of the act  which immediately impacts securities and exchange commission registrants  public accounting firms  lawyers and securities analysts 
this legislation is the most comprehensive since the passage of the securities act of and securities exchange act of it has far reaching effects on the standards of integrity for corporate management  board of directors  and executive management 
the act will require additional disclosures  certifications and procedures 
we do not expect any material adverse effect on our company as a result of the passage of this legislation 
in november  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin addresses the disclosure requirements of a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin were effective for our company for the year ending december  the liability recognition requirements will be applicable prospectively to all guarantees issued or modified after january  we currently do not have guarantees within the scope of this pronouncement  and therefore this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our company s financial position or results of operations

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred versus the date our company commits to an exit plan 
in addition  sfas no 
states the liability should be initially measured at fair value 
the requirements of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  during fiscal year  our company incurred approximately  in restructuring disposal expenses related to the closing of two units in texas 
there were no costs associated with disposal or exit activity in or financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december   our company held cash and cash equivalents of approximately million compared to approximately million as of december  our working capital was approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million at december  our quick ratio  which measures our immediate short term liquidity  was at december  compared to at december  the year over year change in our working capital and quick ratio was primarily due to cash generated from operations

for fiscal  sources of cash generation were primarily from increased accounts payable and decreases in accounts receivable 
net cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily from net income 
net cash used for investing activities for each of the last three fiscal years was approximately million  million and million 
in fiscal  we used cash of million to fund losses and exit from our fumume  llc partnership and million for capital expenditures on construction of three new company owned restaurants and to upgrade existing facilities 
the use of cash was partially offset by payments on notes receivable and cash proceeds from the sale of assets

net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was primarily from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock 
on november   our company issued  shares of common stock in a private equity placement at a value of per share  and received net cash proceeds after commissions and expenses of approximately million 
the proceeds were used primarily to develop new restaurants and for general corporate purposes 
at december   we were a party to a credit agreement with a bank that provided approximately million of borrowing capability to us  of which approximately  was outstanding at december  this agreement was secured by substantially all of our property  and in addition was guaranteed by and secured by certain of the assets of our former chairman  david anderson 
for fiscal year  the credit agreement carried an interest rate of above the prime rate  and provided for borrowing up to a maximum of of the value of a collateral pool which consisted of our property and certain of the property pledged to secure the credit agreement by mr

on march  we completed a million transaction with the landlord at the chicago location that terminated our obligation under the lease 
losses of approximately million related to the exit of this investment were recorded during fiscal when we continue our expansion  we anticipate that additional financing will likely be required 
we anticipate that future development and expansion will be real estate funded or financed primarily through currently held cash and short term investments  and proceeds from forms of financing such as leases  mortgages or other credit facilities 
there are no assurances  however  that additional financing required for expansion will be available on terms acceptable or favorable to us 
we do not anticipate financing through the sale of additional equity 
in addition to commitments we have related to our lease obligations  we also have required payments to be made on our outstanding debt

inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations include food and beverage and labor costs 
in addition  our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs and utilities and these costs are subject to inflationary increases 
we are also subject to interest rate changes based on market conditions 
we believe low inflation rates have contributed to relatively stable costs 
there is no assurance  however  that low inflation rates will continue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and long term debt 
our company includes as cash and cash equivalents certificates of deposits and all other investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash 
our company s cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in our cash and cash equivalents 
the total outstanding long term debt of our company as of december  was million 
of the outstanding long term debt  approximately million consists of a variable interest rate while the remainder was subject to a fixed interest rate 
our company does not see the variable interest rate long term debt as a significant interest rate risk 
some of the food products purchased by us are effected by commodity pricing and are therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors that are outside of our control 
to mitigate this risk in part  we have fixed price purchase commitments from our vendors 
in addition  we believe that substantially all of our food is available from alternate sources which helps to control food commodity risks 
we believe we have the ability to increase or vary menu options offered in response to a food product price increase
