item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading operator in the trillion automotive retailing industry 
through a series of acquisitions  we operate dealership franchises in california  colorado  florida  georgia  louisiana  massachusetts  new jersey  new mexico  oklahoma and texas 
through our dealerships and internet sites  we sell new and used cars and light trucks  arrange related financing  vehicle service and insurance contracts  provide maintenance and repair services  and sell replacement parts 
we also operate collision service centers 
we have diverse sources of automotive retailing revenues  including new car sales  new truck sales  used car sales  used truck sales  manufacturer remarketed vehicle sales  parts sales  service sales  collision repair service sales  financing fees  vehicle service contract fees  insurance fees and after market product sales 
sales revenues from new and used vehicle sales and parts and service sales include sales to retail customers  other dealerships and wholesalers 
finance and insurance revenues include fees from arranging financing  vehicle service and insurance contracts  net of a provision for anticipated chargebacks 
our total gross margin varies as our merchandise mix the mix between new vehicle sales  used vehicle sales retail and wholesale  parts and service sales  collision repair service sales and finance and insurance revenues changes 
our gross margin on the sale of products and services varies significantly  with new vehicle sales generally resulting in the lowest gross margin and finance and insurance revenues generally resulting in the highest gross margin 
when our new vehicle sales increase or decrease at a rate greater than our other revenue sources  our gross margin responds inversely 
factors such as seasonality  weather  cyclicality and manufacturers advertising and incentives may impact our merchandise mix  and therefore influence our gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of incentive based compensation for sales  finance and general management personnel  salaries for administrative personnel and expenses for rent  marketing  insurance and utilities 
we believe that a majority of our selling  general and administrative expenses are variable  allowing us to adjust our cost structure based on business trends 
it takes several months to adjust our cost structure when business volume changes significantly 
interest expense consists of interest charges on interest bearing debt  which is generally based on variable rates 
we receive interest assistance from several of our manufacturers 
this assistance  which is reflected as a reduction of cost of sales  has ranged between and of floorplan interest expense over the past three years  mitigating the impact of interest rate changes on our financial results 
we have grown our business through acquisitions 
over the past five years  we have purchased dealership franchises with annual revenues of approximately billion  disposed of dealership franchises with annual revenues of approximately million and been granted new dealership franchises by the manufacturers 
our acquisition target for is to complete platform and tuck in acquisitions of dealerships that have approximately billion in annual revenues 
current business trends during the last three years  new vehicle sales have ranged between million and million units in the united states 
industry analyst estimates for are predicting new vehicle unit sales of approximately million units 
the used vehicle market has been negatively impacted by aggressive manufacturer incentives on new vehicles during and we expect the used vehicle market to be stable in as we anticipate the new vehicle market improving and increases in manufacturer incentives abating 
due to the increase in vehicles in operation  and the increasing complexity of the vehicles  we expect to see growth in the parts and service market for franchised automobile dealers 
we expect the interest rate environment in to be flat at the beginning of the year with minor increases in the last six months of the year

year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  diluted earnings per share increased  or  to from 
the increase in net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily the result of the accretive impact of acquisitions  organic growth in parts and service  improved used vehicle inventory valuations  which resulted in lower expected losses being reserved  and a reduction in our tax liability as we successfully resolved certain tax contingencies 
offsetting these positives were negative new and used vehicle same store revenues  higher interest expense from our new senior subordinated note issuance and very unfavorable results from our atlanta operations 
revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december   from  million for the year ended december  the growth in total revenues came from acquisitions  which were partially offset by a same store revenues decline of million 
new vehicle revenues increased million  as acquired operations offset a same store decline of million 
the same store revenues decreased reflecting a less robust vehicle market in  particularly with respect to our ford and mitsubishi dealerships  as these manufacturers lost market share nationally during additionally  revenues were down at a toyota dealership in houston due to increased competitive pressures in that market 
our used vehicle retail revenues declined million as revenues from acquired operations were offset by a million decline in our same store sales 
the same store sales decline was due primarily to high levels of manufacturer incentives on new vehicle sales  which reduced the price difference to the customer between a late model used vehicle and a new vehicle  thus switching more customers to new vehicles 
wholesale sales increased million 
the decline in retail sales required us to wholesale more vehicles to keep inventory turns on target and inventory levels in line with expected retail sales volumes 
the increase in parts and service revenues of million included a same store revenues increase of million 
the same store revenues increase was driven by increased customer pay parts and service sales and wholesale parts sales  which were driven by expanded wholesale parts operations in oklahoma city 
retail finance fee revenues increased million  with a million same store decrease partially offsetting the revenues contributed by acquisitions 
the same store decline was caused primarily by a decline in retail unit sales  partially offset by the impact of a favorable interest rate environment 
vehicle service contract fee revenues increased million  of which million was from the recognition of revenues related to contracts requiring revenue deferral over the life of the contracts 
during we did not sell any contracts requiring revenue and cost deferral 
we expect the deferred revenues balance at december   and the associated deferred costs  to be recognized over the next four years 
the increases were partially offset by same store sales decreases of million 
the same store decline is due to the decline in retail unit sales  partially offset by increased revenues per unit sold 
the increased revenues per unit sold was driven by the receipt of increased annual incentives on vehicle service contract sales  increased sales training and our customers increased ability and willingness to finance vehicle service contract purchases due to the low interest rates available 
other finance and insurance revenues increased million  of which million was from the recognition of revenues related to contracts requiring revenue deferral over the life of the contracts 
the deferred revenues consist primarily of amounts related to sales of credit life and accident and health insurance contracts  which are reinsured by a company we own 
the remainder is related to certain products sold in two platforms in prior years 
the platforms did not sell a significant number of contracts requiring revenue and cost deferral during  thus  we expect the majority of the remaining deferred revenues  and associated deferred costs  to be recognized over the next four years 
the increases were partially offset by same store sales declines of million 
the same store decrease is driven primarily by a decline in retail unit sales 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to an increase in the gross margin from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december   and increased revenues 
the gross margin increased  as lower margin new and used vehicle revenues decreased as a percentage of total revenues  and finance and insurance revenues  per retail unit sold  increased 
although our new vehicle gross profit per retail unit remained consistent with the prior year  the gross margin on new vehicle retail sales declined to from due to an increase in the average selling price of vehicles sold 
our used vehicle gross profit per retail unit sold increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  our used vehicle retail gross margin increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase per retail unit sold and the increase in the retail gross margin were due primarily to increased gross margins in the florida market and improved used vehicle valuations at year end  which resulted in reduced valuation reserves 
our used vehicle inventory is required to be carried at the lower of cost or estimated market value at the end of each reporting period 
valuation reserves are provided against the inventory balance based on a detailed review of our inventory  actual subsequent sales of the inventory  our historical loss experience and our consideration of current market trends 
as a result  a million reserve for estimated used vehicle losses was established at december   as compared to a million reserve at december  the net decline of million in the used vehicle valuation reserve  based on billion of used vehicle sales  was due to the application of losses incurred retailing and wholesaling used vehicles during against the reserve 
based on a detailed review of our used vehicle inventory at december   subsequent sales of this inventory and economic trends indicating an improved used vehicle market  we determined that million was the appropriate used vehicle valuation reserve in the current environment  and it was not necessary to charge used vehicle cost of sales to establish the used vehicle valuation reserve at the same level as at december  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the additional operations acquired 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of gross profit to from due primarily to below expected operating performance in our atlanta and dallas operations and adjustments to variable expenses lagging the decline in sales volume 
interest expense 
floorplan and other interest expense  net  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to an increase in the average balance of debt outstanding partially offset by a decline in interest rates 
during  our average debt outstanding increased due to increased floorplan borrowings and the issuance  in august  of million of senior subordinated notes 
floorplan borrowings increased due to acquisitions completed during and  and an increase in our average new vehicle inventory supply to days during from days during partially offsetting the factors increasing the average floorplan borrowings outstanding was the use of the proceeds from our senior subordinated notes offering to temporarily pay down our floorplan notes payable 
interest expense on our floorplan notes payable and acquisition borrowings under the bank credit facility is based on libor plus a spread 
during  there was an approximately basis point reduction in the average libor rate as compared to the prior year 
other income expense  net 
other income increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to a net gain of million on the disposal of dealership assets in  as compared to million of losses recorded on the repurchases and retirements of a portion of our senior subordinated notes during provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to a million reduction in our estimated tax liabilities as a result of the favorable resolution of tax contingencies during as various state and federal tax audits were concluded  providing certainty and resolution on various formation  financing  acquisition and structural matters 
in addition  various other tax exposures of acquired companies have been favorably resolved 
the impact of the change in our reserve was to reduce our effective tax rate for to as compared to for we expect our effective tax rate in future years to be between and

year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december   from  million for the year ended december  the growth in total revenues came from acquisitions  which were partially offset by a same store revenues decline of million 
new vehicle revenues increased million  as acquired operations offset a same store decline of million 
the same store revenues decreased slightly  which reflected a less robust vehicle market in  as compared to the near record new vehicle sales in  for all automobile retailers in the united states 
our used vehicle retail revenues declined million as revenues from acquired operations were offset by an million decline in our same store sales 
the same store sales decline was due to high levels of manufacturer incentives on new vehicle sales  which reduced the price difference to the customer between a late model used vehicle and a new vehicle  thus switching more customers to new vehicles 
wholesale sales increased million 
the decline in retail sales required us to wholesale more vehicles to keep inventory turns on target and inventory levels in line with expected retail sales volumes 
the increase in parts and service revenues of million was from acquired operations as our same store sales declined million 
the primary driver of the same store sales decline was the ford firestone tire recall  which caused a one time increase in warranty and associated repairs at our ford dealerships during also contributing to the decrease was increased business during the summer months of  due to the damage caused by tropical storm allison  in houston 
these declines offset the same store increases we had in other areas of our operations 
retail finance fee revenues increased million  with a million same store decrease partially offsetting the revenues contributed by acquisitions 
the same store decline was caused primarily by zero percent financing offered by many of the manufacturers for our customers  which began late in and continued throughout  which reduced the amount of fees we earned for arranging the financing 
vehicle service contract fee revenues increased million  with same store sales increasing million 
included in the revenues from acquired dealerships is million of deferred revenues recognized on dealer obligor contracts written prior to our acquisitions of the dealerships 
at the date of acquisition  we moved the dealerships to administrator obligor contracts 
other finance and insurance revenues increased million  with same store sales contributing million 
the same store increases were driven by the introduction and sale of new products  in addition to our training programs 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to an increase in the gross margin from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december   and increased revenues 
the gross margin increased  as lower margin new and used vehicle revenues decreased as a percentage of total revenues  and increased finance and insurance revenues  per retail unit sold  offset the decline in the new and used vehicle gross margins 
the gross margin on new retail vehicle sales declined to from  partially due to a reduction in floorplan assistance received from our manufacturers as a result of the decline in interest rates during the year  which reduced our gross profit by million and our gross margin by basis points 
floorplan assistance is a purchase discount and is recorded as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales 
performance below expectations and prior year levels in our dallas operations accounted for approximately basis points of the decline in our new vehicle margin 
also  generally  the gross profit per retail unit does not vary with changes in the selling prices of the vehicles 
as such  the increase in our average selling price per new vehicle sold negatively impacted our new vehicle gross margin by basis points 
the gross margin on retail used vehicle sales increased to from as our dealerships worked to increase the gross profit per unit sold to offset the impact of the reduction of retail used vehicle sales 
our wholesale losses increased  as we wholesaled more vehicles  in light of the decline in the retail sales volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the additional operations acquired and increased compensation and benefits 
compensation and benefits are largely incentive based and constitute approximately of total expenses  and increased due to increased gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of gross profit to from due primarily to below expected operating performance in our atlanta and dallas operations 
excluding the gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses of our atlanta and dallas operations  our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profit would have been in depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decline was due to the implementation of sfas no 
 which resulted in the elimination of goodwill amortization expense 
interest expense 
floorplan and other interest expense  net  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a decline in interest rates and a lower average balance of debt outstanding 
during the year ended december   there was an approximately basis point reduction in our floorplan financing rate as compared to the prior year 
during october  we completed a million stock offering and used the proceeds initially to pay down borrowings under our credit facility 
by the end of the third quarter of  we had reborrowed the amounts used to pay down the floorplan portion of our credit facility 
we had no borrowings under the acquisition portion of our credit facility during other income expense  net 
other expense increased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to million of losses recorded on the repurchases and retirements of a portion of our senior subordinated notes 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations  our credit facilities which include floorplan facilities and an acquisition facility and equity and debt offerings 
the following table sets forth selected historical information from our statements of cash flows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    cash flows total cash at december   was million 
operating activities 
net income plus depreciation and amortization is generally a good indicator of our operating cash flow as revenues are converted into cash in a very short timeframe  typically less than two weeks  and there are very few deferred expenses 
additionally  while our inventory balances can change dramatically from period to period  there is typically little impact on cash flow from operations as changes in contracts in transit  vehicle receivables and floorplan notes payable generally combine to offset the impact of the inventory change 
for the three year period ended december   we generated million in net cash from operating activities  primarily driven by net income plus depreciation and amortization 
investing activities 
during  the million of cash used for investing activities was primarily attributable to the use of million of cash in acquisitions  net of cash balances obtained in the acquisitions  and million for purchases of property and equipment 
approximately million of the property and equipment purchases were for the purchase of land and construction of new or expanded facilities 
offsetting these uses was million received from the sales of property and equipment and million received from the sale of one dealership franchise during during  the million of cash used for investing activities was primarily attributable to the use of million of cash in acquisitions  net of cash balances obtained in the acquisitions  and million for purchases of property and equipment 
approximately million of the property and equipment purchases were the purchase of land and construction of new or expanded facilities 
offsetting these uses was million received from the sales of three dealership franchises during during  million of cash was used for investing activities primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment and cash paid in acquisitions  net of cash balances obtained in the acquisitions  partially offset by proceeds from sales of franchises 
during  we used approximately million in purchasing property and equipment  of which  approximately million was for the purchase of land and construction of new or expanded facilities 
financing activities 
we used approximately million in financing activities during  primarily for payments on our credit facility  using the proceeds from our issuance of senior subordinated notes in august and cash flows from operations 
additionally  we spent million for repurchases of common stock 
during  we obtained approximately million from financing activities  primarily borrowings under our credit facility 
we reborrowed amounts available under our credit facility that were paid down with the proceeds from our stock offering in october additionally  we spent million repurchasing a portion of our senior subordinated notes and million for repurchases of common stock 
during  we used approximately million in financing activities 
the uses were primarily attributable to payments made on our revolving credit facility and repurchases of common stock  largely offset by the proceeds of our common stock offering 
in october  we completed an offering of million shares of our common stock  with net proceeds from the offering  after expenses  of approximately million 
the proceeds from the offering  as well as cash flows from operations  were used to reduce the outstanding balance under our credit facility by million working capital 
at december   we had working capital of million  which is approximately million higher than we believe we need to operate our existing business 
on march   we used approximately million of this excess working capital to fund the redemption of our senior subordinated notes 
we expect to use the remaining excess working capital to fund acquisitions and anticipated capital expenditures 
historically  we have funded our operations with internally generated cash flow and borrowings 
while we cannot guarantee it  based on current facts and circumstances  we believe we have adequate cash flow coupled with borrowing capacity under our credit facility to fund our current operations and capital expenditures and acquisitions budgeted for if our capital expenditure or acquisition plans for as outlined below change  we may need to access the private or public capital markets to obtain additional funding 
changes in our working capital are driven primarily by changes in floorplan notes payable outstanding 
borrowings on our new vehicle floorplan notes payable  subject to agreed upon pay off terms  are equal to of the factory invoice of the vehicles 
borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan notes payable  subject to agreed upon pay off terms  are limited to of the aggregate book value of our used vehicle inventory 
at times  as at december   we have made payments on our floorplan notes payable using excess cash flow from operations and the proceeds of debt and equity offerings 
as needed  we reborrow the amounts later  up to the limits on the floorplan notes payable discussed above  for working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures or general corporate purposes 
stock repurchase in february  the board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our stock  subject to management s judgment and the restrictions of our various debt agreements 
our agreements  subject to other covenants  allow us to use a percentage of our cumulative net income to repurchase stock and pay dividends 
during we repurchased approximately  shares for approximately million 
as of december   million remained under the board of directors authorization 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures include expenditures to extend the useful life of current facilities and expenditures to start or expand operations 
historically  our annual capital expenditures exclusive of new or expanded operations have approximately equaled our annual depreciation charge 
expenditures relating to the construction or expansion of dealership facilities  generally  are driven by new franchises being granted to us by a manufacturer  significant growth in sales at an existing facility or manufacturer imaging programs 
during  we plan to invest approximately million to expand existing facilities  prepare four new facilities for operations and purchase equipment for new and expanded facilities 
we have agreed to sell three of the new facilities completed during expected total proceeds from the sales of these construction projects is estimated at approximately million  resulting in net capital expenditures for new and expanded operations of million 
upon sale we will begin leasing the facilities from the buyer  resulting in an estimated incremental annual rent expense of million  per year 
acquisition financing our acquisition target for is to complete platform and tuck in acquisitions that have approximately billion in annual revenues 
we expect the cash needed to complete our acquisitions will come from excess working capital  operating cash flows of our dealerships and borrowings under our credit facility 
depending on the market value of our common stock  we may issue common stock to fund a portion of the purchase price of acquisitions 
we purchase businesses based on expected return on investment 
generally  the purchase price is approximately to of the annual revenue 
thus our targeted acquisition budget of billion is expected to cost us between and million  which is expected to be funded with a blend of cash and the issuance of common stock 
since december   we have completed acquisitions of four franchises 
one of the acquisitions  with three franchises  is a new platform in new jersey 
the other franchise was acquired in a tuck in acquisition and will complement platform operations in central texas 
the aggregate consideration paid in completing these acquisitions was approximately million in cash  net of cash received   shares of common stock and the assumption of million of inventory financing 
credit facilities during june  we completed an amendment to our existing million credit facility and entered into a new credit facility with ford motor credit company 
the two facilities provide us with billion of borrowing capacity 
million credit facility 
the amendment to our existing credit facility extended the term until june and provides million of financing  consisting of two tranches of the facility is for floorplan financing the floorplan tranche and is for working capital and acquisition financing the acquisition tranche 
the acquisition tranche  which bears interest at a rate of libor plus a margin varying between and basis points  determined based on a ratio of debt to equity  totals million 
the amount available to be borrowed under the acquisition tranche is dependent upon a calculation based on our cash flow 
the floorplan tranche bears interest at rates of libor plus basis points for new vehicle inventory and libor plus basis points for used vehicle inventory 
the credit facility also contains various covenants including financial ratios  such as fixed charge coverage  interest coverage and a minimum net worth requirement  among others  as well as other requirements that must be maintained 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the lending group is comprised of major financial institutions  including two manufacturer captive finance companies 
as of february   million was available  after deducting million for outstanding letters of credit  to be drawn under the acquisition tranche for working capital  acquisition or floorplan financing and letters of credit 
the credit facility allows up to of net income to be used for cash dividends and stock repurchases 
ford motor credit facility 
simultaneous with the amendment of the above described credit facility  we entered into a separate floorplan financing arrangement with ford motor credit company fmcc facility to provide financing for our entire ford  lincoln and mercury new vehicle inventory 
the arrangement provides for up to million of financing for the inventory at an interest rate of prime plus basis points minus certain incentives  and matures in june we expect the net cost of these borrowings  after all incentives  to approximate our floorplan cost under the million credit facility 
the following table summarizes our outstanding borrowings and total commitments under our credit facilities outstanding unused total at december  commitments commitment in millions floorplan tranche acquisition tranche total bank facility fmcc facility total credit facilities  the outstanding balance at december  includes million of letters of credit 
for a more detailed discussion of our credit facilities  please read notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate swaps 
on july   one of our interest rate swaps  with a notional amount of million  reached its termination date 
therefore  at this time  we have only one interest rate swap outstanding  with a notional amount of million that converts the interest rate on a portion of our floorplan borrowings from the day libor based rate to a fixed rate of plus the applicable spread 
senior subordinated notes offering during august  we completed a private offering of million of senior subordinated notes due net proceeds from the offering were million and were used to temporarily pay down floorplan borrowings under the floorplan tranche of our credit facility  currently bearing interest at 
as of march   we have reborrowed approximately million in completing acquisitions and million in the redemption of all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the senior subordinated notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our dealership subsidiaries and contain various provisions that permit us to redeem the notes at our option and a requirement that we repurchase all of the notes upon a change of control 
additionally  the notes contain various covenants  including financial ratios  such as cash flow coverage  as well as other requirements that must be maintained  such as limitations on the payment of dividends and repurchase of stock  among others 
for a more detailed discussion of our notes please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements and obligations and commitments the following is a summary of our off balance sheet arrangements and future contractual cash obligations as of december  thereafter total in millions off balance sheet arrangements leases        contractual commitments capital expenditures    on balance sheet obligations debt   floorplan notes payable   other long term obligations total obligations and commitments        excludes interest payments 
we lease various real estate  facilities and equipment under long term operating lease agreements 
generally  the leases have year total terms with initial terms of years and three five year option periods  at our option 
additionally  we generally have an option to purchase the real estate and facilities at the end of the lease term  and a right of first refusal  giving us the opportunity to purchase the real estate and facilities if the owner reaches an agreement to sell them to a third party 
our credit facilities are currently set to mature in june the credit facilities provide commitments for inventory financing up to million  of which we had borrowed million at december  payments  generally  are required to be made on the floorplan notes payable as the vehicles are sold 
the acquisition tranche of our credit facility also provides commitments for a revolving credit line for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  up to million  of which million was outstanding under letters of credit at december  on march   we completed the redemption of all of our senior subordinated notes 
the amount necessary to complete the redemption was obtained through borrowings under the floorplan tranche of our credit facility 
the face value of million is included in the debt line in the thereafter column in the preceding table 
discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant estimates made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate to reserves for inventory valuations and future chargebacks on finance and vehicle service contract fees  and valuation of intangible assets 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
below is a discussion of what we believe are our critical accounting policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our accounting policies 
inventories new  used and demonstrator vehicles are stated at the lower of cost or market 
vehicle inventory cost consists of the amount paid to acquire the inventory  plus reconditioning cost  cost of equipment added and transportation cost 
additionally  we receive interest assistance from some of our manufacturers 
the assistance is accounted for as a vehicle purchase price discount and is reflected as a reduction to the inventory cost on the balance sheet and as a reduction to cost of sales in the income statement as the vehicles are sold 
parts and accessories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market 
as the market value of our inventories typically declines with the passage of time  valuation reserves are provided against the inventory balances based on the historical loss experience and market trends 
additionally  used vehicles present added complexity to the inventory valuation process 
there is no standardized source for determining exact values  as each vehicle and each market we operate in  is unique 
as such  these factors are also considered in determining the appropriate level of valuation reserves 
retail finance and vehicle service contract revenues recognition we arrange financing for customers through various institutions and receive financing fees based on the difference between the loan rates charged to customers over predetermined financing rates set by the financing institution 
in addition  we receive fees from the sale of vehicle service contracts to customers 
we may be charged back chargebacks for unearned financing fees or vehicle service contract fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
the revenues from financing fees and vehicle service contract fees in administrator obligor states are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles and a reserve for future chargebacks is established based on historical operating results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
in dealer obligor states  revenues from vehicle service contract fees and related direct costs are deferred and recognized over the life of the contracts 
due to changes in state law during  none of the states we currently operate in are dealer obligor states 
intangible assets in june  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets was issued 
sfas no 
changes the treatment of goodwill by no longer amortizing goodwill  however  other identifiable intangible assets are to be separately recognized and amortized  as applicable 
the statement requires  at least annually  an assessment for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets by applying a fair value based test 
we complete the required assessment at the end of each calendar year  and at such other times as required by events or circumstances at a reporting unit indicating a potential reduction of fair value below book value 
in performing the assessment  we estimate the fair value of our intangibles using a calculation based on the historical and expected cash flows of the dealerships  market trends and conditions  review of completed transactions and current market valuations 
a portion of our intangible assets relates to franchise value  which is considered to have an indefinite life  with goodwill accounting for the remainder 
we adopted this statement effective january  adoption did not result in an impairment of any intangible assets  based on the new fair value based test  however  changes in facts and circumstances surrounding this estimate could result in an impairment of intangible assets in the future 
legal proceedings from time to time our dealerships are named in claims involving the manufacture of automobiles  contractual disputes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
currently  no legal proceedings are pending against or involve us that  in our opinion  could be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  the results of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  and changes in facts and circumstances could impact our estimate for reserves for legal proceedings 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for a portion of the claims related to our employee medical benefits and property casualty insurance programs  requiring us to make estimates regarding expected claims to be incurred 
these estimates  for the portion of claims not covered by stop loss insurance  are based on certain actuarial assumptions  and our historical claims experience 
changes in the frequency or severity of claims could impact our reserve for claims 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rate exposure through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
additionally  interest rate swaps may be used to adjust our exposure to interest rate movements 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
all interest rate swaps are non trading and qualify for hedge accounting 
liability expected maturity date fair value at december  dollars in millions thereafter total variable rate debt current average interest rates non current average interest rates 
total variable rate debt 
interest rate swaps average pay rate fixed average receive rate variable net variable rate debt based on day libor and prime as of december  the average rate shown includes the spread charged on our floorplan notes payable 
the swap s variable rate is based on day libor 
at december   our variable rate floorplan notes payable have decreased since the prior year due to decreased leverage on the inventory partially offset by increases in inventory levels 
a basis point increase in interest rates would have increased floorplan interest expense million for the year ended december   before the impact of our interest rate swaps 
we have had no other significant balances outstanding under variable rate borrowing agreements 
at times  we have used interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
currently  we have one interest rate swap outstanding  with a notional amount of million and converting day libor to a fixed rate 
another swap  with a notional amount of million  expired at the end of july as the swaps hedged our floorplan interest rate exposure  the impact on interest expense is included in floorplan interest expense in our statements of operations 
a basis point increase in interest rates would have reduced the cost of the swaps and  thus  would have reduced our floorplan interest expense by million for the year ended december  the swap currently outstanding expires at the end of october as such  depending on interest rate levels during the last two months of  and whether we enter into other interest rate swaps  our floorplan interest expense could be impacted 
the net result on floorplan interest expense of a basis point increase in interest rates would have been an increase of million  after combining the increase in expense on our borrowings and the decrease in expense from our swaps 
additionally  we receive floorplan interest assistance from the majority of our manufacturers 
this assistance  which has ranged from approximately to of our floorplan interest expense over the past three years  totaled million during and million during we treat this interest assistance as a vehicle purchase price discount  and reflect it as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales as new vehicles are sold 
approximately half of the assistance we receive varies with changes in interest rates and thus mitigates the impact of interest rate changes
