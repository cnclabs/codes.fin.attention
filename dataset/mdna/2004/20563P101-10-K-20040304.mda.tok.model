item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the company reported net income of million  or 
per diluted share  in compared to net income of 
million  or 
per diluted share  in and million  or 
per diluted share  in as more fully described below  the company s diluted earnings per share increased from to due primarily to the net effects of i lower operating income in  ii lower interest expense in and iii a lower effective income tax rate in the company s diluted earnings per share decreased from to due primarily to the net effects of i lower operating income in  ii a gain on the sale of a plant facility in  iii lower interest expense in and iv a higher effective income tax rate in fluctuations in currency exchange rates as compared to the prior year positively impacted sales by million but negatively impacted cost of goods sold by million and operating profit by million 
the impact on net sales is primarily due to the weakening us dollar in relation to the euro and canadian dollar 
the impact on operating income is primarily from the company s canadian operations  where the majority of net sales are denominated in us dollars while the majority of expenses are denominated in canadian dollars 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not significantly affect the company s results in as compared to compx is continuing its focus on opportunities to improve its cost structure 
o in the fourth quarter of  the company retooled its byron center  michigan precision slide facility to improve the efficiency of manufacturing several product lines 
the company began to realize the favorable benefit of this retooling in its operating results in the first quarter of  and expects the improvement will continue during resulting from higher volumes and improved manufacturing efficiency 
o in the first half of  the company consolidated its two canadian plants into a single facility 
the company began to realize the favorable benefit of this consolidation and resulting reduced cost structure in its operating results in the fourth quarter of o during the third quarter of  compx initiated a restructuring of its regout subsidiary in europe and incurred a million charge 
the company expects to begin realizing the favorable benefits from restructuring actions in its operating results by the second quarter of cash provided by operating activities improved to million in from million in working capital management was a significant contributor to the improvement in cash flow 
specifically  the company continues to implement lean manufacturing initiatives which have reduced days in inventory from at the beginning of to at the end of the year  resulting in a positive cash flow from inventory of million 
this along with other measures have enabled the company to pay down million of debt in and an additional million in january critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  the recoverability of other long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets and the realization of deferred income tax assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical financial statement judgment risks of its business are attributable to four primary areas o will customer accounts receivable on the books be collected at full book value o will inventory on hand be sold with a sufficient mark up to cover the cost to produce and ship the product o will future cash flows of the company be sufficient to recover the net book value of long lived assets o will future taxable income be sufficient to utilize recorded deferred income tax assets the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates  as noted above  used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and are applicable to all of the company s operating segments o allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company takes into consideration the current financial condition of the customers  the age of outstanding balances and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowances 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  increased allowances may be required 
o inventory reserves 
the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
the company also considers the age and the quantity of inventory on hand in estimating the reserve 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  increased inventory reserves may be required 
o net book value of long lived assets 
the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  whenever it determines that recovery of the long lived asset is not probable 
the determination is made in accordance with applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  property and equipment is not assessed for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
during  impairment indicators were present only with respect to the company s thomas regout bv operations 
the company completed an impairment review of such net property and equipment and related net assets as of september  such analysis indicated no impairment was present as the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with such segment exceeded the carrying value of such segment s net assets 
significant judgment is required in estimating such undiscounted cash flows 
such estimated cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that such operations will achieve the future cash flows reflected in its projections 
based on the company s latest annual impairment review of goodwill of the reporting units during the third quarter of  no goodwill impairments were deemed to exist 
based on this review  the estimated fair value of the compx security products segment exceeded the net carrying value by  compx waterloo by  and thomas regout by 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair value of these three reporting units are determined based on discounted cash flow projections 
significant judgment is required in estimating such cash flows 
such estimated cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that such operations will achieve the future cash flows reflected in its projections 
in addition to its internal cash flow projections  the company used a third party valuation specialist in reviewing the net assets of its thomas regout bv operations  including goodwill and net property and equipment  for impairment 
o deferred income tax assets 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realizable under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized 
this would result in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in estimate is made 
results of operations the company s operating segments are defined as components of its operations about which separate financial information is available that is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker in determining how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the company has three operating segments compx security products  compx waterloo and thomas regout 
the compx security products segment  with manufacturing facilities in south carolina and illinois  manufactures locking mechanisms and other security products for sale to the office furniture  banking  vending  computer and other industries 
the compx waterloo segment  with facilities in canada  michigan and taiwan  and the thomas regout segment  with facilities in the netherlands  both manufacture and distribute a complete line of precision ball bearing slides for use in office furniture  computer related equipment  tool storage cabinets and other applications 
additionally  the compx waterloo segment manufactures and distributes ergonomic computer support systems for office furniture 
historically  the company has aggregated the compx waterloo and thomas regout operating segments into a single reportable segment because of similar economic characteristics  products  customer types  production processes  and distribution methods 
due to the continued weakness in the european office furniture market and the divergence in operating income between the two segments  the company has determined that these two segments no longer have similar economic characteristics  and accordingly the company no longer aggregates the compx waterloo and thomas regout operating segments 
aggregated segment amounts reported for compx waterloo thomas regout in previous periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
intersegment sales are intercompany shipments from thomas regout to compx waterloo 
net sales and operating income years ended december  change in millions net sales compx waterloo compx security products thomas regout intersegment sales total net sales operating income loss compx waterloo 
nm compx security products thomas regout nm total operating income operating income loss margin compx waterloo compx security products thomas regout total operating income margin nm not meaningful year ended december  compared to year ended december  currency 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states in canada  the netherlands and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the canadian dollar  the euro and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations principally in canada are denominated in the non us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar values of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect the compx waterloo and thomas regout segments  and do not materially affect the compx security products segment 
during  currency exchange rate fluctuations of the canadian dollar and the euro positively impacted the company s sales comparisons with principally with respect to slide products  and negatively impacted the company s operating income comparisons 
net sales were positively impacted while operating income was negatively impacted by currency exchange rates in the following amounts by segment as compared to the currency exchange rates in effect during compx compx security thomas waterloo products regout total impact on net sales    impact on operating income   net sales 
net sales increased million  or  in compared to principally due to the strengthening of the euro and canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar  combined with a strong fourth quarter for security products 
in addition to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  net sales increased in as compared to due to higher sales volumes of security products  and precision slide products in north america partially offset by lower sales volumes of ergonomic products and lower sales volumes of precision slide products in europe 
net sales of slide products in increased as compared to  while net sales of security products increased and net sales of ergonomic products decreased during the same period 
the percentage changes in slide and ergonomic products includes the impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales of security products are generally denominated in us dollars 
costs of goods sold 
the company s cost of goods sold increased in compared to in line with the increase in net sales during the same period 
cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales was even with as cost improvement initiatives  such as improving facility efficiency  offset expenses of approximately  to consolidate the two kitchener  ontario plants into a single facility during  the negative impact of the aforementioned changes in currency exchange rates and increases in the cost of steel  the primary raw material for the company s products 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries  commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense declined slightly from of net sales in to in restructuring charge 
due to continued operating losses at the company s thomas regout subsidiary in europe resulting from the continued downturn in the european office furniture market  the company commenced a strategic analysis of the thomas regout segment during the third quarter of as part of the ongoing analysis of these operations  the company determined that it should significantly reduce headcount in the operations in order to be competitive 
prior to the end of september  the company finalized and communicated to the employees a restructuring plan detailing the cost to terminate approximately employees  and accordingly the company has recognized a million restructuring charge related to the headcount reduction 
the million represents severance to be paid to the terminated employees  which is expected to be paid through the end of the second quarter of the company expects the restructuring to result in annual cost savings of approximately million to million which is expected to begin to positively impact financial results in the second quarter of charges 
the company recorded a pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of of million  the majority of which was non cash in nature 
the fourth quarter charge relates to a retooling of the company s precision slide manufacturing facility in byron center  michigan and includes a million loss on disposal of equipment  reflected in other general corporate income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 
the remainder of the charge is reflected in cost of goods sold 
an additional fourth quarter pre tax charge of approximately million was recorded to cost of goods sold to adjust for various changes in estimates with respect to obsolete and slow moving inventory  inventory overhead absorption rates and other items 
approximately million of this charge related to the compx waterloo segment with the remaining 
million relating to the compx security products segment 
operating income 
operating income for decreased million  or compared to and operating margins decreased to in compared to for continued reductions in manufacturing  fixed overhead and other overhead costs combined with the impact of the fourth quarter charge partially offset the effects of the changes in currency exchange rates  changes in product mix  the cost of the european restructuring  and increases in certain raw material costs primarily steel 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  currency 
the effect of changes in currency exchange rates from to was not material to sales or operating income of the company or any of its segments 
net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  in compared to principally due to continued weak demand for the company s component products sold to the office furniture market resulting from continued weak economic conditions in the manufacturing sector in north america and europe 
net sales of slide products in decreased as compared to  while net sales of security products decreased and net sales of ergonomic products decreased during the same period 
cost of goods sold 
the company s cost of goods sold decreased only in compared to despite the decrease in net sales during the same period 
therefore  the company s gross margin percentage decreased significantly from in to in the disproportionate change in cost of goods sold and its effect on gross margins was primarily due to lower revenues from sales of slide and ergonomic products and the resulting impact of spreading fixed factory costs over lower volume 
in addition  steel cost increases following the steel tariff imposed by the united states government increased the company s raw material cost  most of which was not immediately recoverable through sales price increases in such steel cost increases resulted in additional raw material costs to compx of approximately million compared to steel raw material pricing 
the compx waterloo segment was most significantly impacted by the steel cost increases  while the effects on the compx security products segment were minimal 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries  commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense was in and in charges 
in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a million charge for headcount reductions of about employees in compx s european operations substantially all of which had been implemented by december  of the million charge  as adjusted for changes in currency exchange rates  approximately 
million was paid in  million was paid in and 
million was paid in january in addition  approximately million in pre tax charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of these charges are predominately comprised of million related to various changes in estimates with respect to reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory  approximately 
million related to allowances for doubtful accounts  with the remainder related to other items 
of the million charges  approximately million related to the compx security products segment   related to the compx waterloo segment  and  related to the thomas regout segment 
operating income 
operating income for decreased million  or compared to and operating margins decreased to in compared to for continued reductions in manufacturing  fixed overhead and other overhead costs partially offset the effects of the decline in net sales in and the impact of the fourth quarter charge previously discussed 
however  operating margins in continued to be adversely impacted by the decline in volume levels  unfavorable changes in the sales mix  increases in certain raw material costs primarily steel and general competitive pricing pressures 
through december   goodwill was amortized by the straight line method over not more than years 
upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january   goodwill is no longer subject to periodic amortization 
the company would have reported operating income of approximately million in if the goodwill amortization included in the company s reported operating income had not been recognized 
general the company s profitability primarily depends on its ability to utilize its production capacity effectively  which is affected by  among other things  the demand for its products and its ability to control its manufacturing costs  primarily comprised of labor costs and raw materials such as zinc  copper  coiled steel and plastic resins 
raw material costs represent approximately of the company s total cost of sales 
during and  worldwide steel prices increased following the steel tariff imposed by the united states government 
the company occasionally enters into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not commit the company to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows the company to stabilize raw material purchase prices to a certain extent  provided the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities are met 
the company enters into such arrangements for zinc  coiled steel and plastic resins and anticipates further significant changes in the cost of these materials  primarily coiled steel  from their current levels for the next year 
materials purchased on the spot market are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
due to the competitive nature of the markets served by the company s products  it is often difficult to recover such increases in raw material costs through increased product selling prices 
consequently  overall operating margins may be affected by such raw material cost pressures 
other general corporate income expense  net as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements  other general corporate income expense  net primarily includes interest income  losses on disposal of property and equipment and net foreign currency transaction gain and loss 
in  loss on disposal of property and equipment included approximately million related to the retooling of the company s precision slide manufacturing facility in byron center  michigan 
the remainder of the pre tax charge  
million  is reflected in cost of goods sold and related to the cost of moving and installing machinery and equipment as well as the disposal of obsolete inventory 
interest income decreased in compared to due primarily to lower interest rates earned on funds available for investment combined with a lower level of funds available for investment 
in  a curtailment gain of approximately 
million was included in other general corporate income  net 
this curtailment gain  more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  relates to the cessation of benefits provided under compx s defined benefit plan which covered substantially all full time employees of thomas regout international bv as of december   certain obligations related to the terminated plan had not yet been fully settled and are reflected in accrued pension costs 
in  such obligations were settled and the company reported a 
million settlement gain 
interest expense interest expense declined 
million in compared to due primarily to lower average levels of borrowing on compx s revolving bank credit facility  partially offset by higher interest rates 
interest expense declined million in compared to due to lower average interest rates and lower levels of outstanding indebtedness 
interest expense in is expected to be lower compared to due to the reduction in the outstanding indebtedness 
provision for income taxes the principal reasons for the difference between compx s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax rates vary by jurisdiction country and or state  and relative changes in the geographic mix of compx s pre tax earnings can result in fluctuations in the effective income tax rate 
net income in was negatively impacted by an increase in the effective income tax rate primarily as a result of lower income levels and an increased proportion of foreign sourced dividend income taxed at a higher effective tax rate 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective january   the company no longer recognizes periodic amortization of goodwill 
under gaap  generally there is no income tax benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes attributable to goodwill amortization 
accordingly  ceasing to periodically amortize goodwill beginning in resulted in a reduction in the company s overall effective income tax rate in as compared to  partially offsetting the increased effective tax rate on foreign sourced income 
other reflected in the results of operations is a million gain on the sale leaseback of the company s manufacturing facility in the netherlands  which is discussed more fully below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions compx is a party to certain transactions with related parties 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
outlook the company expects that weak market conditions will continue in the office furniture market  the primary end market for the company s products  during while the business and institutional furniture manufacturer s association bifma international has predicted a growth in furniture shipments for  the total volume of shipments is expected to be below the highest annual volume set in if the prediction is correct  would be the first year of office furniture industry growth since however  competitive pricing pressures are expected to continue to be a challenge as foreign manufacturing  particularly in china  gains market share 
the company expects steel prices to continue to rise in as much as to  or more 
the company has initiated price increases on certain of its products and will continue to focus on cost improvement initiatives  utilizing lean manufacturing techniques and prudent balance sheet management in order to minimize the impact of lower sales to the office furniture industry and to develop value added customer relationships with additional focus on sales of the company s higher margin ergonomic computer support systems to improve operating results 
the company currently expects to realize annual cost savings of to million as the result of the current thomas regout headcount reduction 
however  the company continues with its ongoing strategic analysis of the operations  and additional actions could be taken in the future that could result in charges for asset impairment  including goodwill  and other costs in future periods 
these actions  along with other activities to eliminate excess capacity  are designed to position the company to more effectively concentrate on both new product and new customer opportunities to improve company profitability 
liquidity and capital resources summary 
the company s primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is its cash flow from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends if declared 
from time to time  the company will incur indebtedness  primarily for short term working capital needs or to fund capital expenditures 
from time to time  the company may also sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to repay indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold or to fund capital expenditures 
at december   the company s indebtedness aggregated million  all of which matures in january in january  the company repaid million of such indebtedness  using available funds on hand 
because the maturity date of the indebtedness isn t until  the company does not expect it will be required to use any of its cash flow from operating activities generated during to repay indebtedness  although it may chose to do so 
cash provided by operating activities improved to million in from million in working capital management was a significant contributor to the improvement in cash flow 
specifically  the company continues to implement lean manufacturing initiatives which have reduced days in inventory from at the beginning of to at the end of the year  resulting in a positive cash flow from inventory of million 
this along with other measures have enabled the company to pay down million of debt in and an additional million in january consolidated cash flows operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  for  and have generally been similar to the trend in the company s earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in compared to due to an increased amount of assets put into service over the past year and a half relating to specific customer volume combined with the impact of changes in currency exchange rates but decreased in compared to due primarily to the cessation of amortization of goodwill 
see notes and changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such changes in assets and liabilities generally tend to even out over time 
however  year to year relative changes in assets and liabilities can significantly affect the comparability of cash flows from operating activities 
in  accounts receivable  inventory  and accounts payable all declined as a result of the decline in sales volume 
in  the declines in accounts receivable and accounts payable are again the result of the lower sales volumes  but the inventory decrease is relatively more significant as the company began to realize some of the benefit of its lean manufacturing initiatives 
for  the increase in sales volumes resulted in higher accounts receivable and accounts payable balances while the company continued to actively reduce inventory levels 
investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  million in cash was provided from the sale leaseback of the company s plant facility in the netherlands 
other cash flows from investing activities in each of the past three years related principally to capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in the past three years emphasized manufacturing equipment which utilizes new technologies and increases automation of the manufacturing process to provide for increased productivity and efficiency 
capital expenditures in through relate primarily to general equipment upgrades  modernization  and capacity increases relating to specific customer volume 
pursuant to the sale leaseback of the company s plant facility in maastricht  the netherlands  compx sold the manufacturing facility for million cash consideration in december  and compx simultaneously entered into a leaseback of the facility with a nominal monthly rental for between and months depending on when the alternative location has cleared all regulatory hurdles 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to the agreement  compx is also obligated to acquire up to acres from the municipality for approximately million within the next four years 
acquisition at this property is subject to the municipality meeting certain conditions which have not yet been met 
capital expenditures for are estimated at approximately million  the majority of which relate to projects that emphasize improved production efficiency 
firm purchase commitments for capital projects in process at december  approximated 
million 
financing activities 
net cash used by financing activities totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
total cash dividends paid in each of and were million 
per share and in was million 
per share 
the company suspended its regular quarterly dividend in the second quarter of the company borrowed a net million under its revolving bank credit facility in  and repaid a net million and million under such facility during and  respectively 
in addition  in january the company further reduced the outstanding balance under the revolving bank credit facility by million 
the company s million secured revolving bank credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of the company s united states assets and at least of the ownership interests in the company s first tier non united states subsidiaries 
provisions contained in the revolving bank credit agreement could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness prior to its stated maturity for reasons other than defaults from failing to comply with typical financial covenants 
for example  the company s credit agreement allows the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
the terms of the credit agreement could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other than certain operating leases discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  neither compx nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates are parties to any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other management believes that cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under the credit agreement  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service 
to the extent that the company s actual operating results or other developments differ from the company s expectations  compx s liquidity could be adversely affected 
the company periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  its capital expenditure requirements  dividend policy and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of its common stock  modify its dividend policy or take a combination of such steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  the company may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations in the component products industry 
in the event of any such transaction  the company may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing the indebtedness of the company or its subsidiaries 
contractual obligations 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company is obligated to make future payments under certain debt and lease agreements  and is a party to other commitments 
the following table summarizes these obligations as of december  payments due by period less than total year years years in thousands long term debt   capital lease obligations and other operating leases   purchase obligations   fixed asset acquisitions   total contractual cash obligations     the purchase obligations consist of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations  primarily commitments to purchase raw materials 
fixed asset acquisitions include firm purchase commitments for capital projects and the obligation to purchase up to acres from the municipality of maastricht within the next four years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company periodically uses currency forward contracts to manage a portion of foreign exchange rate risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency 
otherwise  the company does not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor does the company enter into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
other than the contracts discussed below  the company was not a party to any forward or derivative option contract related to foreign exchange rates or interest rates at december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  substantially all of the company s outstanding indebtedness were variable rate borrowings 
such borrowings at december  related principally to million million at december  in borrowings under the company s secured revolving bank credit agreement 
the outstanding balances at december  and which approximate fair value had a weighted average interest rate of and  respectively 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility are due in january the remaining indebtedness outstanding at december  and is not material 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products outside the united states principally canada  western europe and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the non us dollar  principally the canadian dollar  the euro and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations principally in canada are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
certain of compx s sales generated by its canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
to manage a portion of the foreign exchange rate market risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  at december  compx held a series of short term forward exchange contracts maturing through february to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars at exchange rates of cdn 
to cdn 
per us dollar 
at each balance sheet date  outstanding currency forward contracts are marked to market with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently 
the difference between the estimated fair value and the face value of all such outstanding forward contracts at december  is not material 
at december   the actual exchange rate was cdn 
per us dollar 
at december  compx had entered into a series of short term forward exchange contracts maturing through january to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars at an exchange rate of cdn 
per us dollar 
other 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events or losses 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties some of which are listed in business general
