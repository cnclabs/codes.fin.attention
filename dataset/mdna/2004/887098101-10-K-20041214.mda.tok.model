operating strategy the bank is a community oriented bank which has traditionally offered a wide variety of savings products to its retail customers while concentrating its lending activities on real estate loans 
the primary elements of the bank s operating strategy include emphasize residential mortgage lending and residential construction lending 
the bank has historically attempted to establish itself as a niche lender in its primary market areas by focusing a part of its lending activities primarily on the origination of loans secured by one to four family residential dwellings  including an emphasis on loans for the construction of residential dwellings 
in an effort to meet the credit needs of borrowers in its primary area  the bank actively originates one to four family mortgage loans that do not qualify for sale in the secondary market under fhlmc guidelines 
the bank has also been an active participant in the secondary market  originating residential loans for sale to the fhlmc on a servicing retained basis 
the bank occasionally retains fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans in its portfolio for yield and asset liability management purposes 
diversify primary market area by expanding branch office network 
in an effort to lessen its dependence on the grays harbor county market whose economy has historically been tied to the timber and fishing industries  the bank has opened branch offices in pierce  king  thurston and kitsap counties 
thurston  pierce  king and kitsap counties contain the olympia  bremerton  and seattle tacoma metropolitan areas and their economies are more diversified with the presence of government  aerospace and computer technology industries 
subsequent to september   the bank acquired two branches in lewis county from venture bank as part of a seven branch acquisition 
for additional information see item  business recent developments and market area 
limit exposure to interest rate risk 
in recent years  a majority of the loans that the bank has retained in its portfolio generally have periodic interest rate adjustment features or have been relatively short term in nature 
loans originated for portfolio retention primarily have included arm loans and short term construction loans 
longer term fixed rate mortgage loans have generally been originated for sale in the secondary market 
management believes that the interest rate sensitivity of these adjustable rate and short term loans more closely match the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s funding sources than do other longer duration assets with fixed interest rates 
emphasize the origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
the bank established a business banking division in for the purpose of increasing the bank s origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
originally  three lenders were hired to staff the division 
currently  a division manager and six lenders are active in the origination of commercial loans 
increase the consumer loan portfolio 
in the bank hired a consumer loan specialist to increase the origination of consumer loans 
the consumer loans generated since that time have been secured primarily by real estate 
the bank expects to continue expanding its portfolio of consumer loans 
pursue low cost core deposits and deposit related fee income 
the bank has placed an emphasis on attracting commercial and personal checking accounts 
these transactional accounts typically provide a lower cost of funding than certificates of deposit accounts and generate non interest fee income 
the bank implemented a checking account acquisition program in to increase these transactional accounts 
subsequent to september   the bank increased its transaction account base by acquiring seven branches and the related deposits from venture bank

market risk and asset and liability management general 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investment  deposit and borrowing activities 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the bank manages other risks  such as credit quality and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk that could potentially have the largest material effect on the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
the bank does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instruments nor does it engage in hedging activities or derivative instruments 
furthermore  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates 
the bank has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s interest earning assets by retaining in its portfolio  short term loans and loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustments 
the bank relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits  compared to brokered deposits  reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the bank promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms of up to six years 
the bank has adopted a strategy that is designed to substantially match the interest rate sensitivity of assets relative to its liabilities 
the primary elements of this strategy involve originating arm loans for its portfolio  maintaining residential construction loans as a portion of total net loans receivable because of their generally shorter terms and higher yields than other one to four family residential mortgage loans  matching asset and liability maturities  investing in short term securities  originating fixed rate loans for retention or sale in the secondary market  and retaining the related loan servicing rights 
sharp increases or decreases in interest rates may adversely affect the bank s earnings 
however  based on a rate shock analysis prepared by the fhlb seattle  an increase in interest rates of up to basis points would increase the bank s projected net interest income  primarily because a larger portion of the bank s interest rate sensitive assets than interest rate sensitive liabilities would reprice within a one year period 
similarly  further decreases in interest rates would negatively affect net interest income  as repricing would have the opposite effect 
management has sought to sustain the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
pursuant to this strategy  the bank actively originates adjustable rate loans for retention in its loan portfolio 
fixed rate mortgage loans generally are originated for the immediate or future resale in the secondary mortgage market 
at september   adjustable rate mortgage loans and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities constituted million or  of the bank s total combined mortgage loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio 
although the bank has sought to originate arm loans  the ability to originate such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers preferences 
particularly in lower interest rate environments  borrowers often prefer fixed rate loans 
consumer loans and construction and land development loans typically have shorter terms and higher yields than permanent residential mortgage loans  and accordingly reduce the bank s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at september   the construction and land development  and consumer loan portfolios amounted to million and million  or and of total loans receivable including loans held for sale  respectively 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
management of the bank monitors the bank s interest rate sensitivity through the use of a model provided for the bank by the fhlb seattle 
the model estimates the changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income in response to a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the model first estimates the level of the bank s npv market value of assets  less market value of liabilities  plus or minus the market value of any off balance sheet items under the current rate environment 
in general  market values are estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows of each instrument by appropriate discount rates 
the model then recalculates the bank s npv under different interest rate scenarios 
the change in npv under the different interest rate scenarios provides a measure of the bank s exposure to interest rate risk 
the following table is provided by the fhlb seattle based on data at september  net interest income current market value projected interest rate estimated change change estimated change change scenario value from base from base value from base from base dollars in thousands base   computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan repayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
furthermore  the computations do not reflect any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  the bank would be expected to experience a decrease in npv and a decrease in net interest income 
in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  a decrease in npv and a increase in net interest income would be expected 
based upon the modeling described above  the bank s asset and liability structure generally results in decreases in npv and decreases in net interest income in a declining interest rate scenario 
this structure also generally results in increases in net interest income in a rising interest rate environment 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could possibly deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
comparison of financial condition at september  and total assets total assets increased million to million at september  from million at september  primarily due to increases of million in total loans  million in cash and due from financial institutions  million in investment securities and million in fed funds sold 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in interest bearing deposits in banks 
the net asset growth was primarily funded by increased deposits and fhlb advances 
premises and equipment premises and equipment increased  to million at september  from million at september  primarily due to the opening of a new branch in gig harbor during the year 
for additional information on premises and equipment  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
cash and due from financial institutions  interest bearing deposits in banks  and federal funds sold cash and due from financial institutions  interest bearing deposits in banks  and federal funds sold decreased by million to million at september  from million at september  the decrease was a result of using a portion of these short term deposits to fund loan growth  to fund the company s stock repurchase program  and to fund the purchase of additional investment securities 
investments  mortgage backed securities and fhlb stock investments  mortgage backed securities and fhlb stock increased by million to million at september  from million at september   as additional us agency securities and mortgage backed securities were purchased 
for additional details on investments and mortgage backed securities  see item  business investment activities and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
loans receivable and loans held for sale  net of allowance for loan losses net loans receivable  including loans held for sale  increased by million to million at september  from million at september  the increase in the portfolio was primarily a result of increases of million in commercial real estate loans  million in consumer loans  million in one to four family mortgage loans  million in land loans  million in construction loans net of undisbursed portion  and million in commercial business loans 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in multi family loans 
loan originations totaled million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september  the bank sold million in fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september  loan originations and loan sales were higher in primarily due to the robust refinance activity of single family mortgage loans attributed to the low interest rate environment 
for additional information on loans  see item  business lending activities and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
real estate owned real estate owned reo and other repossessed items decreased  to  at september  from million at september  the balance decreased as ten properties were sold and four properties were added to reo status during the year 
for additional information on reos  see item  business lending activities nonperforming assets and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
deposits deposits increased by million to million at september  from million at september   primarily due to increases of million in now checking accounts  million in non interest bearing accounts  and million in money market accounts 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in certificate of deposit accounts and million in savings accounts 
the bank continues to focus on attracting transaction accounts rather than higher rate certificate of deposit accounts 
transaction accounts represent a stronger core deposit relationship than other types of deposit accounts 
for additional information of deposits  see item  business deposit activities and other sources of funds and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
borrowings borrowings increased by million to million at september  from million at september  the increased borrowings were used to fund a portion of the bank s loan portfolio growth 
for additional information on borrowings  see item  business deposit activities and other sources of funds borrowings and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity decreased by million to million at september  from million at september   primarily due to the repurchase of  shares of the company s stock for million  the payment of million in dividends to shareholders and a  decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
partially offsetting these decreases to equity  were net income of million and a million increase to additional paid in capital from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of shares associated with the bank s benefit plans 
also increasing shareholders equity were decreases of  and  in the equity components related to unearned shares issued to the management recognition and development plan mrdp and the esop  respectively  as more shares vested under the mrdp and were released under the esop 
on february   the company announced a plan to repurchase  shares of the company s stock 
this marked the company s twelfth stock repurchase plan 
as of september   the company has repurchased  of these shares at an average price of per share 
cumulatively the company has repurchased  of the  shares that were issued when the company went public in january at an average price of per share 
comparison of financial condition at september  and total assets total assets increased million to million at september  from million at september  this change is reflected primarily in a million increase in investments and interest bearing deposits in banks and a million increase in premises and equipment 
premises and equipment premises and equipment increased million to million at september  from million at september  the increase is primarily related to the opening of two new branches silverdale and olympia  the opening of a new facility to house the bank s loan servicing department and escrow department  and the purchase of equipment in conjunction with the bank s technology improvement initiatives 
for additional information on premises and equipment  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
cash and due from financial institutions cash and due from financial institutions and interest bearing deposit balances in banks increased to million at september  from million at september  the increase is primarily due to investing the proceeds from increased customer deposits 
investments  mortgage backed securities and fhlb stock investments  mortgage backed securities and fhlb stock increased million to million at september  from million at september  as proceeds from increased customer deposits were invested 
for additional details on investments and mortgage backed securities  see item  business investment activities and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
loans receivable and loans held for sale  net of allowance for loan losses net loans receivable  including loans held for sale  decreased slightly to million at september  from at september  the composition of the portfolio continued to migrate away from the bank s historical dependence on one to four family mortgage loans as the percentage of one to four family mortgage loans decreased to at september  from at september  the lower levels of one to four family mortgage loans were partially offset by increased levels of construction loans  commercial real estate loans  and consumer loans 
during the year one to four family mortgage loans decreased by million and multi family mortgage loans decreased by million 
however  net construction loans increased by million  commercial mortgage loans increased by million  and consumer loans increased by million 
loan volume was very strong during the year ended september  as the bank originated loans of million and sold million in fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans 
management elected to sell a majority of the fixed rate residential loans originated rather than adding them to the bank s portfolio due to the low interest rate environment 
for additional information on loans  see item  business lending activities and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements conained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
real estate owned reo and other repossessed items increased  to million at september  from  at september  the balance increased as nine properties totaling million were added to reo status and seven properties totaling  were sold during the year 
for additional information  see item  business lending activities nonperforming assets and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
deposits deposits increased by million to million at september  from million at september   primarily due to increases of million in now checking accounts  million in passbook savings accounts  and million in non interest bearing accounts 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in money market accounts and million in certificate of deposit accounts 
the bank chose not to compete for high rate certificate of deposit accounts  electing instead to focus on attracting transaction accounts that typically provide more of a core deposit relationship with customers 
for additional information on deposits  see item  business deposit activities and other sources of funds and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
borrowings borrowings decreased  to million at september  from million at september  due to scheduled amortization payments on fhlb advances 
for additional information on borrowings  see item  business deposit activities and other sources of funds borrowings and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased by million to million at september  from million at september  the components of shareholders equity were primarily affected by net income of million  the repurchase of  shares of the company s stock for million and the payment of million in dividends to shareholders 
also affecting shareholders equity was a million increase to additional paid in capital from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of shares associated with the bank s benefit plans 
also increasing shareholders equity were a  decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income  and decreases of  and  in the equity components related to unearned shares issued to the mrdp and esop  respectively  as more shares vested under the mrdp and were released under the esop 
on february  the company announced a plan to repurchase  shares of the company s stock 
this marked the company s eleventh stock repurchase plan 
as of september   the company had purchased  of these shares and cumulatively had repurchased  of the  shares that were issued when the company went public in january comparison of operating results for years ended september  and net income net income for the year ended september  was million  or per diluted share per basic share compared to million  or per diluted share per basic share for the year ended september  the lower earnings were primarily the result of decreased income from loan sales and increased non interest expenses  which were partially offset by increased net interest income 
specifically  the per share decrease in earnings for the year ended september  was a result of the million million net of income tax per diluted share decrease in non interest income and the   net of income tax per diluted share increase in non interest expense 
these items were partially offset by a million  net of income tax per diluted share increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses and a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding due to share repurchases  which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately the company also incurred expenses of approximately   net of income tax in connection with the acquisition of seven venture bank branches 
the transaction closed on october  and the company estimates that it will incur approximately   net of income tax in additional acquisition related expenses during the first quarter of the next fiscal year 
the company believes that the transaction will be accretive net of the initial transaction expenses within one year following full integration of the new branches into the bank s system 
however  during the initial two quarters  net income may be negatively impacted by the acquisition as a portion of the acquired deposits will be invested in short term investments with lower yields 
as the acquired deposits are deployed into loans  the transaction will contribute to earnings 
the company believes that this acquisition brings solid potential to generate long term earnings growth and increase shareholder value 
for additional information on the acquisition of venture bank branches  see item  business recent developments 
net interest income net interest income increased  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a decrease in the company s funding costs 
total interest expense decreased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as the company s total cost of funds decreased to from 
interest expense on deposits decreased million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  primarily due to lower average rates paid on interest bearing accounts and a change in the composition of average interest bearing deposits 
in  certificates of deposits  the company s highest cost of deposits  comprised of average interest bearing deposits 
in  certificates of deposit comprised of average interest bearing deposits 
the change in the composition of the deposit base is a result of the continued focus on attracting transaction accounts rather than higher rate certificates of deposit 
interest expense on fhlb advances decreased  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a reduction in the average outstanding fhlb advances to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  partially offsetting the decreased interest expense was a decrease in interest income 
total interest income decreased  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a reduction in average yields on earning assets 
the yield on earning assets was for the year ended september  compared to for the year ended september  as a result of these changes  the net interest margin increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses for the year ended september  decreased by  to  from  for the year ended september  the provision for loan losses was lower primarily due to changes in the loss factors used in the allowance for loan loss analysis and a lower level of net charge offs experienced 
for the years ended september  and  net charge offs were  and  respectively 
the bank has established a systematic methodology for determining the provision for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis the bank performs and analysis taking into consideration historic loss experience for various loan segments  changes in economic conditions  delinquency rates  and other factors to determine the level of allowance for loan losses needed 
the allowance for loan losses had a net increase of  to million at september  from million at september  the increased level of the allowance for loan losses was primarily due to a larger loan portfolio loans receivable and loans held for sale  which increased million to million at september  from million at september  partially offsetting the increased allowance tied to loan portfolio growth  were changes in the loss factors used in the allowance for loan loss analysis for certain categories 
based on the trends in the historical charge off and improved economic conditions  the loss factors used in the allowance for loan loss analysis for one to four family loans  multi family loans  commercial real estate loans  land loans  and commercial business loans were decreased during the year 
based on the systematic methodology  management deemed the allowance for loan losses of million at september  of loans receivable and of non performing loans adequate to provide for probable losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at that date 
for additional information  see item  business lending activities allowance for loan losses 
non interest income total non interest income decreased million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a million decrease in income from loan sales gain on sale of loans and servicing income on loans sold  a  decrease in gain on sale of securities  a  decrease in escrow fees  a  decrease in loan application fees  an  decrease in atm transaction fees  an  decrease in services charges on deposits  and a  decrease in boli income 
income from loan sales decreased as mortgage banking activity slowed and the bank began holding some fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans in its portfolio 
the bank sold million in fixed rate one to four mortgages during the year ended september  compared to million for the same period a year ago 
non interest expense total non interest expense increased by  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase is primarily a result of a  increase in employee expenses  a  increase in audit and sarbanes oxley related expenses  an  increase in premises and equipment expenses  and  in expenses related to the bank s acquisition of venture bank branches 
the increased employee expenses are primarily due to a larger employee base  annual salary adjustments  and increased medical insurance costs 
the number of full time equivalent employees increased during the year to at september  from at september  as the bank opened a new branch in gig harbor and increased staffing levels in several other departments 
as a result of the increased non interest expenses  the company s efficiency ratio increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  primarily as a result of lower income before taxes 
the effective tax was for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  comparison of operating results for years ended september  and net income net income for the year ended september  was million  or per diluted share per basic share compared to million  or per diluted share per basic share for the year ended september  the lower earnings for the current year were primarily a result of increased non interest expenses related to technology improvements  higher employee costs resulting from a larger employee base  and higher premises and equipment expenses due to additional branches and remodeling costs 
the increased expenses were  however  partially offset by higher non interest income  largely related to mortgage loan sales and earnings on bank owned life insurance 
during the year a number of technology enhancements were implemented to provide additional opportunities to serve and expand the bank s customer base 
the bank converted to the kirchman bankway core processing system from its in house supported system  and changed its internet banking system  its loan platform system and its atm service provider 
the technology related conversion expenses totaled   net of income tax and reduced earnings by per diluted share 
the majority of the company s planned technology related conversion expenses occurred during the year ended september  however  the company does anticipate additional conversion expenses related to employee overtime  additional equipment upgrades  and continued training to occur during the quarters ended december  and march  as additional aspects of the technology upgrades are fully implemented 
while the technology upgrades reduced profitability in the short term  the company believes the investment will be beneficial to its customers and ultimately to its long term investors 
net interest income net interest income decreased  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  total interest income decreased million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a reduction in average yields on earning assets 
the yield on earning assets was for the year ended september  compared to for the year ended september  in addition to overall lower market rates  the yield on earning assets was also reduced by a change in the composition of total earning assets 
in  loans  the company s highest yielding class of assets  comprised of average earning assets 
in  loans comprised of average earning assets 
this change was largely influenced by the decision to sell many of the loans originated during this low interest rate cycle 
that had the effect of increasing the gain on loans sold  at the expense of interest income 
the impact of lower average yields was  however  partially offset by increased levels of average earning assets 
total interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the average cost of funds for each of the bank s deposit account types for the current period was lower than a year ago 
the overall cost of funds decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  as a result of these changes  the net interest margin decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the provision for loan losses was lower in primarily because the bank experienced a lower level of net charge offs in for the years ended september  and  net charge offs were  and  respectively 
the bank has established a systematic methodology for determining the provision for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis the bank performs an analysis taking into consideration historic loss experience for various loan segments  changes in economic conditions  delinquency rates  and other factors to determine the level of allowance for loan losses needed 
the allowance for loan losses had a net increase of  to million at september  from million at september  the increased level of allowance for loan losses was primarily due to an increased level of loans classified as substandard and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
the level of loans classified as substandard increased the level of allowance for loan losses deemed necessary by the analysis as the aggregate amount of substandard loans increased million to million at september  from million at september  also contributing to the higher allowance for loan loss level were changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
the combined percentage of construction and commercial real estate loans in the portfolio increased to at september  from at september   while the percentage of one to four family mortgage loans declined to at september  from at september  construction lending and commercial real estate lending typically involve a greater degree of risk than one to four family residential mortgage lending and therefore construction loans and commercial real estate loans have been assigned a loss factor that is greater than the loss factor assigned to one to four family residential mortgage loans 
estimated loss factors used in the allowance for loan loss analysis are established based in part on historic charge off data by loan category and economic conditions 
based on the trends in the historical charge off analysis  the loss factors used in the allowance for loan loss analysis for credit cards were increased during the year ended september  and the loss factors for commercial business loans were decreased 
based on the systematic methodology  management deemed the allowance for loan losses of million at september  of loans receivable and of non performing loans adequate to provide for estimated losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at that date 
for additional information  see item  business lending activities allowance for loan losses included herein 
non interest income for the year ended september  non interest income increased million to million from million for the year ended september  this increase is primarily due to a  increase in boli income  a  increase in gain on sale of loans  a  increase in security sale gains  and a  increase in service charges on deposits 
the increased boli income is a result of having a full year s earnings on the boli investment that was made in september the increased loan sale gains are primarily the result of a larger volume of mortgage banking activity due to the strong refinance demand  which was prompted by a decline in interest rates to historically low levels 
the bank sold million in fixed rate one to four family mortgages during the year ended september  compared to million for the previous year 
non interest expense for the year ended september  non interest expense increased by million to million from million for the year ended september  the increase is primarily a result of increased employee expenses  increased premises and equipment expenses and technology enhancement expenses 
during the year  the company converted to the kirchman bankway core processing system from its in house supported system  and changed its internet banking system  its loan platform system and its atm service provider 
the technology enhancements were undertaken to provide additional opportunities to serve and expand the bank s customer base 
the technology related conversion expenses totaled  for the year ended september  and are reflected in the income statement under other non interest expenses  premises and equipment expenses  and salaries and employee benefit expenses 
while the technology upgrades reduced profitability in the short term  the company believes the investment will be beneficial to its customers and ultimately to its long term investors 
salary and benefit expenses increased primarily due to a larger employee base as the bank opened two new branches during the year and increased staffing levels in several other departments 
the number of full time equivalent employees increased during the year to at september  from at september  premises and equipment expense increased during the year primarily due to the additional branches opened  expenses associated with remodeling the bank s loan center  and the technology related expenses previously discussed 
as a result of the increased non interest expenses  the company s efficiency ratio increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  primarily as a result of lower income before taxes and an increased level of tax exempt income 
the effective tax rate was for the year ended september  and for september  the lower effective rate was primarily a result of the increased level of tax exempt income from the bank owned life insurance program that was implemented in september average balances  interest and average yields cost the earnings of the company depend largely on the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities  as well as the relative amount of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liability portfolios 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest earning assets and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and average yields and costs 
such yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average weekly balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods presented 
average balances are derived from weekly balances 
management does not believe that the use of weekly balances instead of daily balances has caused any material difference in the information presented
