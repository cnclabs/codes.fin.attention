residential mortgage loan closings during the fourth quarter of were million compared to billion during the fourth quarter of credit risk management extending credit to businesses and consumers exposes the company to credit risk 
credit risk is the risk that the principal balance of a loan and any related interest will not be collected due to the inability of the borrower to repay the loan 
the company manages credit risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to consistent underwriting standards  guidelines and limitations established by senior management 
written loan policies establish underwriting standards  lending limits and other standards or limits as deemed necessary and prudent 
various approval levels  based on the amount of the loan and whether the loan is secured or unsecured  have also been established 
loan approval authority ranges from the individual loan officer to the directors loan committee 

table of contents republic bank has established loan review and quality control functions to conduct ongoing  independent reviews of the lending process 
this group ensures adherence to established policies and procedures  monitors compliance with applicable laws and regulations  provides objective measurement of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  and ensures that proper documentation exists 
the following discussion summarizes the underwriting policies and procedures for the major categories within the loan portfolio and addresses the company s strategies for managing the related credit risk 
commercial loans credit risk associated with commercial loans is primarily influenced by prevailing economic conditions and the level of underwriting risk the company is willing to assume 
to manage credit risk when extending commercial credit  the company focuses on adequately assessing the borrower s ability to repay and by obtaining sufficient collateral 
to minimize credit risk  the company concentrates its commercial lending efforts on commercial real estate loans 
at december   commercial real estate loans accounted for of total commercial loans 
emphasis is also placed on loans that are government guaranteed  such as sba loans 
commercial loans are generally secured by the borrower s assets at a or less loan to value ratio and by personal guarantees 
management closely monitors the composition and quality of the total commercial loan portfolio to ensure that significant credit concentrations by borrower or industry do not exist 
residential real estate mortgage loans the company originates fixed rate and variable rate residential mortgage loans which are secured by the underlying unit family residential property 
at december   these loans accounted for of total portfolio loans 
credit risk in this area of lending is minimized by the assessment of the creditworthiness of the borrower  including debt to income ratios  credit bureau scores and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan to value ratios of generally no more than 
residential mortgage loans granted in excess of the loan to value ratio criterion are generally insured by private mortgage insurance  unless otherwise guaranteed or insured by the federal or state government 
credit risk is further reduced since the majority of the company s fixed rate mortgage loan production is sold to investors in the secondary market without recourse 
installment loans credit risk in the installment loan portfolio is controlled through consistent adherence to conservative underwriting standards that consider  but are not necessarily limited to  debt to income levels  past payment tendencies as evidenced by credit bureau reports  and loan to value ratios as to any collateral 
asset quality non performing assets non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  restructured loans and other real estate owned oreo 
oreo represents real estate properties acquired by the company through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure 
commercial loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is days or more past due  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
residential real estate mortgage loans and installment loans are placed in non accrual status at the time the loan is four scheduled payments past due or days or more past the maturity date of the loan 
in all cases  loans may be placed on non accrual status earlier when  in the opinion of management  reasonable doubt exists as to the full  timely collection of interest or principal 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest accruals cease and any uncollected interest is charged against current income 
interest subsequently received on non accrual loans is applied against the principal balance

the company believes the risk allocated allowance for loan losses attributable to these loans is adequate under present economic conditions and circumstances 
approximately million  or  of total loans at december  were to days delinquent  compared to million  or of total loans at december  the company also maintains a list of potential problem loans classified as watch and substandard  but excluding non accrual and restructured loans identified as requiring a higher level of monitoring where known information about possible borrower credit problems raises serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the repayment terms 
as of december   total potential problem loans  excluding those categorized as non accrual loans  were million  or of total loans  compared to million  or of total loans at december  the following table presents the amount of interest income that would have been earned on non performing loans outstanding at december   and had those loans been accruing interest in accordance with the original terms of the loan agreement  as well as the amount of interest income earned and included in net interest income for each of those years

table of contents impaired loans sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 considers a loan impaired when it is probable that payment of principal and interest will not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the original loan agreement 
consistent with this definition  all non accrual and restructured loans with the exception of residential mortgage and consumer installment loans are considered impaired 
an impaired loan for which it is deemed necessary to record a specific allocated allowance may be written down to the fair value of the underlying collateral via a direct charge off against the allowance for loan losses at the time it is determined the loan balance exceeds the fair value of the collateral 
consequently  those impaired loans not requiring a specific allocated allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the underlying collateral equaled or exceeded the recorded investment in the loan 
all impaired loans were evaluated using the fair value of the underlying collateral as the measurement method 
at december  and  the gross recorded investment in impaired loans totaled million and million  respectively 
similar to non accrual loans  interest payments subsequently received on impaired loans are applied against the principal balance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impaired loans 
provision and allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents the company s estimate of probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level the company believes is adequate through additions to the provision for loan losses 
an appropriate level of the risk allocated allowance is determined based on the application of risk percentages to graded loans by categories 
specific reserves are established for individual loans when deemed necessary by management 
in addition  management considers other factors when determining the unallocated allowance  including loan quality  changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  consultation with regulatory authorities  amount of nonperforming loans  delinquency trends and economic conditions and industry trends 
due to the inherent risks and uncertainties related to the operation of a financial institution  management must depend on estimates  appraisals and valuations of loans to prepare the company s financial statements 
changes in economic conditions and the financial prospects of borrowers may result in abrupt changes to the estimates  appraisals or evaluations used 
in addition  if actual circumstances and losses differ substantially from management s assumptions and estimates  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to absorb all future losses  and net income could be adversely impacted 
net loan charge offs decreased million to million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease in is primarily due to decreases in the company s indirect installment loan charge offs  which reflect the anticipated run off of these loans following the company s discontinuance of its indirect lending business in the first quarter of net charge offs on indirect installment loans decreased to  in from million in the ratio of net loan charge offs to average loans  including loans held for sale  was

to  depending on category of loans classified as superior  high  satisfactory and moderate  monitor from to  watch from to  substandard from to  doubtful  and loss 
the risk percentages were developed by the company in consultation with regulatory authorities  actual loss experience  peer group loss experience and are adjusted for current economic conditions 
the risk percentages are considered by management to be a prudent measurement of the risk associated with the company s loan portfolio 
such risk percentages are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
non accrual loans are included in the substandard and doubtful classifications in the company s risk rating methodology 
the company reviews each delinquent commercial loan on a bi weekly basis 
grades for commercial loans are assigned based upon review of such factors such as debt service coverage  collateral value  financial condition of the borrower  experience and reputation of management and payment history 
delinquent mortgage and installment loans are reviewed monthly and assigned a rating based on their payment status 
in addition  the commercial loan review committee will  on a monthly basis  conduct reviews of certain individual loans exceeding  that have not exhibited delinquency trends 
these reviews assign a current risk rating based on management s understanding of the financial condition of the borrower and collateral values 
based upon these reviews  the company determines the grades for its loan portfolio on a monthly basis and computes the allocation for allowance for loan losses 
these reviews provide a mechanism that results in loans being graded in the proper category and accordingly  assigned the proper risk percentage in computing the risk allocated or specific allocated allowance 
the company also maintains an unallocated allowance in recognition of the imprecision in estimating and measuring probable credit losses 
the unallocated allowance is utilized to cover losses that may arise from new business migration and imprecision in the risk rating system 
new business migration risk arises from new commercial loans that are typically graded pass  having a short payment history in which to evaluate the performance of the loan 
imprecision in the risk rating system may result from either inaccuracy in assigning the risk ratings or stale risk ratings which may not have been updated for recent negative trends in the particular credits 
the unallocated allowance for loan losses was million at december  and deemed adequate but not excessive by management after assessing the dollar amount of new commercial loans and the current economic environment

in addition  net loan charge offs in decreased from and total non performing assets decreased slightly from december  to december  as a result of the improvement in credit quality  the company determined the provision for loan losses during should be lower than the provision for loan losses in there have been no changes in the company s estimation methods since  however  risk percentages for certain loan classifications within the pass category were adjusted in in  the company added an additional risk rating category  monitor 
the monitor category is utilized for loans that have potential weaknesses that require the added attention of management 
these loans have characteristics  which if not corrected  could impact the ability of such borrowers to comply with the repayment terms 
in addition  the risk percentages for the watch rated loans were increased during to reflect management s revised estimates of potential losses on these loans

off balance sheet transactions in the normal course of business  the company becomes a party to transactions involving financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers and to manage its own exposure to interest rate risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the contractual amounts of these instruments express the extent of the company s involvement in these transactions as of the balance sheet date 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk  market risk and liquidity risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
however  they do not represent unusual risks for the company and management does not anticipate any significant losses to arise from these transactions 
commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend cash to a customer as long as there is no breach of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee 
standby letters of credit guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the company issues these guarantees primarily to support public and private borrowing arrangements  real estate construction projects  bond financing and similar transactions 
the credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with direct lending 
therefore  these instruments are subject to the company s loan review and approval procedures and credit policies 
based upon management s credit evaluation of the counterparty  the company may require the counterparty to provide collateral as security for the agreement  including real estate  accounts receivable  inventories  and investment securities 
the maximum credit risk associated with these instruments equals their contractual amounts and assumes that the counterparty defaults and the collateral proves to be worthless 
the total contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  since many of these agreements may expire without being drawn upon 
at december   no liability is recorded for the commitments to extend credit  while deferred revenue for standby letters of credit was  at december   there was no liability or deferred revenue recorded for the commitments to extend credit or for the standby letters of credit 

table of contents the following table presents the contractual amounts of the company s off balance sheet financial instruments outstanding at december  and table off balance sheet contractual obligations december in thousands financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk commitments to fund residential real estate loans commitments to fund commercial real estate loans other unused commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to provide funds at an acceptable cost to meet loan demand and deposit withdrawals and to service other liabilities as they become due 
managing liquidity also enables the company to take advantage of opportunities for business expansion 
funds are available from a number of sources  including  but not limited to  cash and money market investments  the investment securities portfolio  mortgage loans held for sale and portfolio loan repayments and maturities 
short term liquidity is available from federal funds purchased  reverse repurchase agreements  deposit growth  retail  brokered and municipal certificates of deposit and fhlb advances 
long term liquidity is generated from reverse repurchase agreements  deposit growth  the maturity structure of time deposits  brokered certificates of deposit and fhlb advances 
as of december  the company s balance of certificates of deposit maturing within the next twelve months was million 
the company expects that a significant portion of these certificates of deposit will be renewed based on the company s success at establishing long lasting customer relationships 
however  the company will use its other available funding sources to replace those deposits which are not renewed 
at december   republic bank had available million in unused lines of credit with third parties for federal funds purchased and million available in unused borrowings with the fhlb 
republic bancorp inc has four major funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements interest earning deposits  dividends from republic bank  access to the capital markets and a revolving credit agreement with a third party 
on december   million was available from republic bank for payment of dividends to the parent company without prior regulatory approval  compared to million at december  also  at december   the parent company had interest earning deposits of million at republic bank to meet any liquidity requirements 
in december  the company entered into a million revolving credit agreement with a third party with a floating interest rate based on libor 
there were no advances outstanding under the agreement at december   which expires on december  depending on market conditions and liquidity requirements  the company would also consider the issuance of additional debt or equity instruments to provide additional liquidity  if necessary 
as discussed in item of this report on form k  republic bank is subject to statutory and regulatory requirements and  among other things  may be limited in their ability to pay dividends to the parent company 
these statutory and regulatory restrictions have not had  and are not expected to have  a material effect on the company s ability to meet its cash obligations 

table of contents market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
the company s market risk exposure is composed entirely of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid withdrawn  reprice or mature in specified periods 
because the company s business is subject to many factors beyond its control see forward looking statements on page in managing the company s assets and liabilities  and overall exposure to risk  management must rely on numerous estimates  evaluations and assumptions 
consequently  actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by management or expressed in the company s press releases and public documents 
asset and liability management the primary objective of asset and liability management is to maintain stability in the level of net interest income by producing the optimal yield and maturity mix of assets and liabilities within the interest rate risk limits set by the company s asset and liability management committee alco and consistent with projected liquidity needs and capital adequacy requirements 
interest rate risk management the company s alco  which meets weekly  is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
senior management at republic bank is responsible for ensuring that the bank s asset and liability management procedures adhere to corporate policies and risk limits established by their respective board of directors 
during  short term interest rates decreased and long term interest rates increased 
the three month treasury bill decreased basis points and the prime lending rate decreased basis points from december  to december   while the year treasury bond increased basis points during the demand for residential loans continued to be high for the majority of as mortgage rates remained low by all historical measures 
the increase in long term interest rates did slow residential loan demand in the fourth quarter of the company s residential real estate mortgage balance increased during the year  as new mortgage loan production more than offset loan payoffs within the portfolio 
commercial loan balances grew due to the successful efforts by our team of experienced commercial lenders and the lower prime lending rates 
lower interest rates also continued to attract home equity borrowers as the balance of consumer direct loans grew in the mortgage loans held for sale balance is the company s most interest rate sensitive asset 
it is also short term in nature as the majority of loans held for sale are sold within days 
by funding this balance with primarily short term borrowings  the company is able to both closely match its liquidity needs  as this balance will generally increase in a declining interest rate environment and decrease in a rising interest rate environment  and maintain a consistent interest rate spread when the yield curve moves in parallel shifts 
as is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  committing to fund residential real estate loan applications at specified rates and holding residential mortgage loans for sale exposes the company to market risk during the period after the loans close but before they are sold to investors 
to reduce this exposure to market risk  the company enters into firm commitments to sell such mortgage loans at specified future dates and prices to various third parties 
the company utilizes two complementary quantitative tools to measure and monitor interest rate risk static gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling 
each of these interest rate risk measurements has limitations  but the company believes that when evaluated together  they provide a reasonably comprehensive view of the company s exposure interest rate risk 

table of contents static gap analysis static gap analysis is utilized at the end of each month to measure the amount of interest rate risk embedded in the balance sheet as of a point in time 
the company undertakes this analysis by comparing the differences in the repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a gap is defined as the difference between the principal amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that reprice within a specified time period 
this gap provides a general indication of the sensitivity of the company s net interest income to interest rate changes 
if more assets than liabilities reprice or mature in a given period  resulting in an asset sensitive position or positive gap  increases in market interest rates will generally benefit net interest income because earning asset rates will reflect the changes more quickly than rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
alternatively  where interest bearing liabilities reprice more quickly than interest earning assets  resulting in a liability sensitive position or negative gap  increases in market interest rates will generally have an adverse impact on net interest income 
table presents the static gap analysis 
at december   the cumulative one year gap was a positive of total earning assets 
at december   the cumulative one year gap was a positive of total earning assets 
the company s current policy is to maintain a mix of asset and liabilities with repricing and maturity characteristics that reflect a moderate amount of short term interest rate risk based on current interest rate projections  customer credit demands and deposit preferences 
the company generally operates in a range of zero to of total earning assets for the cumulative one year gap 
management believes that this range reduces the vulnerability of net interest income to large shifts in market interest rates while allowing the company to take advantage of fluctuations in current short term rates 
this range also complements the company s strong retail mortgage banking franchise 
the one year gap at december  exceeded this range primarily due to the prepayment assumptions the model uses in estimating the maturity terms of the residential mortgage portfolio 
with residential mortgage rates at historical lows  prepayment speed assumptions were at high levels resulting in a high level of assumed maturities within the one year period 
the slow down in prepayment speed assumptions to more normalized levels in the latter part of significantly reduced the cumulative one year gap percentage 
earnings simulation on a monthly basis  the earnings simulation model is used to quantify the effects of various hypothetical changes in interest rates on the company s projected net interest income over the ensuing twelve month period 
the model permits management to evaluate the effects of various parallel shifts of the us treasury yield curve  upward and downward  on net interest income expected in a stable interest rate environment ie  base net interest income 
as of december   the earnings simulation model projects the following change in net interest income from base net interest incomes  assuming an immediate parallel shift in market interest rates change in market interest rates in basis points change in net interest income over the next twelve months these projected levels are well within the company s policy limits 
these results portray the company s interest rate risk position as asset sensitive for the one year horizon 
the earnings simulation model assumes that current balance sheet totals remain constant and all maturities and prepayments of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are reinvested at current market rates 
impact of interest rate fluctuations and inflation on earnings unlike most industrial companies  substantially all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rate fluctuations generally have a more significant and direct impact on a financial institution s performance than do the effects of inflation 
to the extent inflation affects interest rates  real estate values and other costs  the company s lending activities may be adversely impacted 
significant increases in interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential property and to qualify for mortgage loans 
as a result  the company s volume of loans originated may be reduced and the potential reduction in the related interest income and fee income may be larger than would be implied by a simple linear extrapolation of the results generated by the earnings simulation model 
a lower interest rate environment would enable more potential borrowers to reduce their mortgage interest rate and qualify for relatively higher mortgage loan balances  therefore resulting in higher mortgage loan production activity as well as interest income

table of contents accounting and financial reporting developments the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies  the most significant of which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies require estimates and assumptions which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
the most critical of these significant accounting policies is the policy for the allowance for loan losses 
see pages and notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the policy on allowance for loan losses 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the provision of sfas became effective june   for all financial instruments created or modified after may   and otherwise became effective as of july  in december  the fasb deferred for an indefinite period the application of the guidance in sfas to noncontrolling interests that are classified as equity in the financial statements of a subsidiary but would be classified as a liability in the parent s financial statements under sfas the deferral is limited to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests associated with finite lived subsidiaries 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities under sfas  as well as amends certain other existing fasb pronouncements 
in general  sfas is effective for derivative transactions entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on financial condition  the results of operations  or liquidity 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which provides guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and results of operations of a vie are to be included in an entity s consolidated financial statements 
a vie exists when either the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities by itself  or the equity investors lack one of three characteristics associated with owning a controlling financial interest 
those characteristics include the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity if they occur  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
in december  the fasb reissued fin with certain modifications and clarifications 
application of this guidance was effective for interests in certain vies commonly referred to as special purpose entities spes as of december  application for all other types of entities is required for periods ending after march   unless previously applied 
effective december   the company adopted the provisions of fin for all interests held in a vie 
the company evaluated various entities in which it held an interest to determine if these entities met the definition of a variable interest entity vie  and whether the company was the primary beneficiary and should consolidate the entity based on the variable interests it held 
the company owns of the common stock of republic capital trust i  which was formed in to issue trust preferred securities 
prior to the fourth quarter adoption of fin  the company consolidated this entity as a result of its ownership of the outstanding common securities 
this entity met the fin definition of a vie  but the company is not the primary beneficiary in the entity 
as such  the company was required to deconsolidate the entity in the fourth quarter deconsolidation of the entity changed the classification of the trust preferred securities held by the company million to subordinated debt 
banking regulators announced that  until notice is given to the contrary  such debt will continue to qualify as tier capital 
no other entities in which the company held significant interest were determined to be vie s under fin all prior periods have been restated to reflect the adoption of fin the requirements of fin did not impact the company s net income or earnings per share 

table of contents in march  the sec issued regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures 
as defined in regulation g  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s historical or future performance  financial position  or cash flow that excludes or includes amounts or adjustments that are included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
companies that present non gaap financial measures must disclose a numerical reconciliation to the most directly comparable measurement using gaap 
management does not believe it has used any non gaap financial measure in this report 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which provides guidance on how to transition from the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under apb to the fair value method of accounting under sfas  if a company so elects 
effective january  the company adopted the fair value method of recording stock options under sfas in accordance with the transitional guidance of sfas  the fair value method of accounting for stock options was applied prospectively to awards granted subsequent to january  as permitted  options granted prior to january  continued to be accounted for under apb opinion  and the pro forma impact of accounting for these options at fair value will continue to be disclosed in the consolidated financial statements until the last of those options vest in in  the company primarily issued restricted stock in lieu of stock option grants 
as a result  the income statement impact associated with expensing stock options was immaterial in as the cost of anticipated future option awards is phased in over a four year period  the annual impact will continue to be immaterial assuming options are granted in future years at a similar level 
the actual impact per diluted share may vary in the event the fair value or the number of options granted increases or decreases from the current estimate  or if the current accounting guidance changes 
the company uses the black scholes model to estimate option values 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation expands the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
fin applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset  liability  or equity security of the guaranteed party 
guarantees subject to the disclosure requirements of fin but not to the recognition provisions include  among others  a guarantee accounted for as a derivative instrument under sfas  a parent s guarantee of debt owed to a third party by its subsidiary or vice versa  and a guarantee which is based on performance not price 
the disclosure requirements of fin were effective for the company as of december   and required disclosure of the nature of the guarantee  the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee  and the current amount of the liability  if any  for the guarantor s obligations under the guarantee 
the recognition requirements of fin were to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  significant guarantees that have been entered into by the company are disclosed in note the requirements of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was issued in july and was adopted by the company beginning january  this statement requires a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity  such as the sale or termination of a line of business  the closure of business activities in a particular location  or a change in management structure  to be recorded as a liability at fair value when it becomes probable the cost will be incurred and no future economic benefit will be gained by the company for such cost 
applicable costs include employee termination benefits  contract termination costs  and costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
sfas supersedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  which in some cases required certain costs to be recognized before a liability was actually incurred 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations in in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas requires an entity to record a liability for an obligation associated with the retirement of an asset at the time the liability is incurred by capitalizing the cost as part of the carrying value of the related asset and depreciating it over the remaining useful life of that asset 
the standard became effective for the company beginning january  and its adoption did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations
