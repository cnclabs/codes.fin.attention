item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business outlook fiscal year was a very exciting year for us because of the soffe acquisition and we are looking forward to the upcoming year 
we will have the soffe sales and profits for the full twelve months of the year  as compared to only nine months in fiscal year in addition  we have sales and marketing strategies in place that we expect will drive organic growth in both business segments in fiscal year in the delta business we have a number of new products that we will be rolling out to the marketplace 
we ve had great success over the last several years growing our customer base 
during fiscal year  the delta segment shipped over three thousand accounts  up sixty eight percent from the prior year 
in fiscal year  we will continue to focus on opening new accounts 
we set new records for shipments out of our florida and west coast distribution centers during the past year 
we believe that having product in close proximity to our customer base enhances our customer service and has proven to be an effective strategy for us 
in fiscal year  we expect to add an additional distribution center in the new england area to serve our customers and also expect to finalize the purchase of a new building in the knoxville  tennessee area to replace the old multi story building we are currently using 
we also have high expectations for the soffe business in fiscal year soffe s dry release t just won the best t shirt in america by readers digest as a part of their best discoveries 
this product has also been well received by our military accounts and should help drive growth in this distribution channel 
a number of new products have also been developed and introduced for our retail and sporting goods channels 
soffe will continue to focus on college bookstores  and now has access to low cost t shirt manufacturing which should allow us to be more aggressive in this channel 
we have implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives that should continue to improve margins at soffe in fiscal and we will continue to expand soffe s product sourcing horizon which should further drive down soffe s product costs 
cotton prices have been very volatile over the past several quarters 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we will be shipping product containing our highest cost cotton 
our cotton cost through cost of sales should then decrease sequentially through the remaining quarters of the fiscal year 

table of contents in the upcoming year  we will also be evaluating our long term strategy to continue to obtain low cost yarn 
our current yarn facility is still producing yarn at competitive prices  and we expect it to continue to produce quality yarn at competitive prices for a number of years 
we continue to evaluate our long term options  which could include an expansion of our facility  a joint venture  a supply agreement with a yarn vendor  or continued purchase of our additional yarn requirements in the open market 
on a consolidated basis we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures in the upcoming year  excluding the new knoxville distribution center for which we are exploring alternative financing packages 
we expect our total investment in this new distribution facility to be in the to million range 
results of operations overview the most significant factor impacting our results of operations for the fiscal year ending july  was the completion of the acquisition of m 
j 
soffe co 
on october   which now operates as our soffe segment 
the acquisition of soffe was an important part of our expansion strategy 
the addition of the soffe business allows us to participate in four additional distinct channels of distribution for activewear products 
we believe the manufacturing  distribution  and marketing synergies between the companies will allow both operations to expand at a faster pace than would be possible on a stand alone basis 
the results of soffe s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 
although we were not pleased with our results in the beginning of fiscal year  business improved in the second half of the year and results met our expectations in the last two quarters 
in the delta segment  selling prices continued to improve throughout the year and  on most basic products  prices were higher in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
the improving trend on pricing  combined with higher sales volume in our non commodity products  drove solid sales results in the delta segment 
sales in the soffe segment exceeded our expectations in the second half of the year  driven by higher branded sales in the retail and military channels 
during the year  we operated our textile facilities at less than full capacity in order to manage our inventory levels and avoid purchasing high cost raw materials 
we expensed the unabsorbed fixed cost created by this strategy during the year 
while this hurt our short term results  we believe this helps position us to take advantage of the opportunities we see in the future 
during the fourth fiscal quarter we made considerable progress on lowering our debt and reducing our inventories 
debt has been reduced by over million since we closed on the soffe acquisition  and we exceeded our inventory reduction targets for the fourth quarter 
quarterly financial data for information regarding quarterly financial data  refer to note quarterly financial information unaudited to the consolidated financial statements

the soffe segment contributed million in net sales for the last nine months of the fiscal year 
gross margins for the year ended july  improved to compared to in the prior year as a result of the higher gross margins associated with the soffe business  which was included in the results for the last nine months of the fiscal year

fiscal year included weeks of operations compared to the weeks of operations in the prior fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were million  or of net sales  an increase of million from million  or of net sales  in fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of the addition of the soffe business  which was included in our results for the last nine months of the fiscal year 
selling costs increased as a percentage of sales primarily as a result of the higher selling costs associated with branded apparel products 
during fiscal we had a recovery of bad debt expense of 
table of contents million compared to a provision for bad debt expense of million during fiscal the recovery of bad debt expense was due to improved accounts receivable agings 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we incurred higher bad debt expenses resulting from the slower payments from customers due to the depressed retail climate and the bankruptcy filing of a customer

the delta and soffe segments contributed million and million in operating income  respectively 
delta segment operating income was lower in fiscal than in fiscal primarily because of the decline in gross margin on basic tee shirts described above 
net interest expense for fiscal year was million  an increase of million from fiscal year the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the increase in average debt outstanding  resulting from the m

soffe acquisition 
our effective tax rate for the year ended july  was compared to for the year ended june  during the fiscal year ending june   we created a tax liability in the amount of approximately million with respect to our tax sharing agreement between delta woodside industries  inc our former parent company and the company 
during the current fiscal year  we determined that it was no longer probable that a tax liability might occur as a result of this tax sharing agreement 
therefore  we reversed the million tax liability that had been created at that time 
net income for fiscal year was million  an increase of million  or  from net income of million for fiscal year  due to the factors described above 
inventories increased million from june  to million on july  the acquisition of m

soffe co 
resulted in an increase of million in inventory compared to the prior year

throughout fiscal year  pricing in the marketplace continued to decrease  primarily in the basic white and colored tees 
we did not fully participate in many of the pricing promotions in the industry  resulting in decreased sales volumes in these products 
the increase in unit sales for fiscal year is the result of increased sales in our heavyweight and specialty products  slightly offset by decreases in our basic tees 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year primarily as a result of lower raw material costs  partially offset by lower average selling prices  throughout fiscal year we also achieved significant cost reductions and increased production efficiencies in our textile and sewing operations during the year

selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were million  or of net sales  an increase of million from million  or of net sales  in fiscal year the increase was primarily driven by an increase of million in distribution costs  an increase of million in selling expenses and an increase of million in bad debt expense 
the increase in distribution expenses mainly relates to the florida distribution center that we opened in february selling expenses for fiscal year were higher due to higher salaries and commission expense  resulting from the increased sales of specialty tees  and higher advertising costs  resulting from direct marketing campaigns

net income for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  from net income of million for fiscal year  due to the factors described above 
inventories at june  totaled million compared to million at june  the increase in inventory is related to an increase of million in finished goods  an increase of million in work in process and a decrease of million in raw materials 
we built higher levels of inventory in the first half of the year in expectation of increased sales over the prior year 
we did not meet sales volume expectations during the fourth quarter  resulting in the increased finished goods inventory at june  textile and apparel production levels were also increased to support the expected sales growth resulting in increased work in process inventory 
our raw material inventory decreased to million at june  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we had begun increasing our raw material inventory to take advantage of lower cotton prices and to support our increased textile capacity

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
table of contents amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the adequacy of receivable and inventory reserves  self insurance accruals and the accounting for income taxes 
note to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales are recorded net of discounts and provisions for estimated returns and allowances 
we estimate returns and allowances on an ongoing basis by considering historical and current trends 
we record these costs as a reduction to net revenue 
we estimate the net collectibility of our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon this assessment 
specifically  we analyze the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
significant changes in customer concentration or payment terms  deterioration of customer credit worthiness or weakening in economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectibility of receivables and our operating results 
inventories our inventory is carried at the lower of fifo cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for damaged  excess and out of style or otherwise obsolete inventory based primarily on our historical selling prices for these products and our estimated forecast of product demand for the next twelve months 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if liquidation of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
self insurance our medical  prescription and dental care benefits are self insured 
our self insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we develop estimates of claims incurred but not reported based upon the historical time it takes for a claim to be reported and historical claim amounts 
while the time it takes for a claim to be reported has been declining  if claims are greater than we originally estimate  or if costs increase beyond what we have anticipated  our recorded reserves may not be sufficient  and it could have a significant impact on our operating results 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities measured by enacted tax rates 
we have recorded deferred tax assets for certain state operating loss carryforwards and nondeductible accruals 
we established a valuation allowance related to certain of the state operating loss carryforward amounts in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets if reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on earnings forecasts in the respective tax locations 
as of july   we had operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for state purposes 
the valuation allowance against the operating loss carryfowards was thousand at july  these carryforwards expire at various intervals through recent accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity 
in december  the fasb published a revision to fin hereafter referred to as fin r to clarify some of the provisions of fin  and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
we determined that we had no interests in variable interest entities 
accordingly the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk sensitivity we purchase cotton from approximately eight established merchants with whom we have long standing relationships 
the majority of our purchases are executed using on call contracts 
these on call arrangements are used to insure that we have available an adequate supply of cotton for our requirements 
under on call contracts  we agree to purchase specific quantities for delivery on specific dates  with pricing to be determined at a later time 
prices are set according to prevailing prices  as reported by the new york cotton exchange  at the time we elect to fix specific contracts 
cotton on call with a fixed price at july  was valued at million  and is scheduled for delivery between july and march at july   we had unpriced contracts for deliveries between october and june based on the prevailing price at july   the value of these commitments was approximately million 
at july   a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price contracts would have had a negative impact of approximately million on the value of the contracts 
at june   cotton on call with a fixed price was valued at million 
at june   a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price contracts would have had a negative impact of approximately million on the value of the contracts 
the effect of a decline in the market price of cotton on our fixed price contracts would have been more at july  than at june  because the value of our fixed price cotton on call contracts was more on july  cotton price movements could result in unfavorable pricing of cotton for us 
we also purchase yarn from third party vendors 
the price of yarn is primarily impacted by the price of cotton  as discussed above 
we use derivatives  including cotton option contracts  to manage our exposure to movements in commodity prices 
we do not designate our options as hedge instruments upon inception 
accordingly  we mark to market changes in the fair market value of the options as other expense income in the statements of income 
we did not own any cotton options on july  interest rate sensitivity our credit agreements provide that the outstanding amounts owed shall bear interest at variable rates 
if the amount of outstanding indebtedness at july  under the revolving credit facilities had been outstanding during the entire year and the interest rate on this outstanding indebtedness were increased by basis points  our expense would have increased by approximately  or  for the fiscal year 
the actual increase in interest expense resulting from a change in interest rates would depend on the magnitude of the increase in rates and the average principal balance outstanding
