item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a leader in bringing value to consumers by designing innovative membership programs that offer members easy access to a variety of discounted products and services provided by the company s participating vendors 
in april  the company broadened the scope of its business by acquiring lavalife  a personals service 
as a result of this acquisition  the company is a leading global provider of web based and ivr based personals services 
the acquisition of lavalife benefits the company by providing access to one of the largest and fastest growing consumer categories on the internet while expanding its target market 
in the past  the company operated in one business segment  membership 
however  with the acquisition of lavalife  management analyzes the company s business based on the following two business segments membership and personals 
for additional financial information about of these business segments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
membership service programs offer consumers a variety of products and services from selected vendors for an annual or monthly fee 
revenues are derived principally from recurring fees which are billed to the member either on an annual or monthly basis 
in the case of annually billed membership fees  the company receives full payment at or near the beginning of the membership period  but recognizes the revenues as the member s refund privilege expires 
membership fees that are billed monthly are recognized when earned 
profitability and cash flow generated from renewal memberships exceed that of new memberships due to the absence of solicitation costs associated with new member procurement 
the personals service business segment employs a transactional business model  in which users buy non refundable credits up front and spend those credits only when they want to interact with other users 
personals services revenues are generally recognized when the services are used 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that are important to the company s financial condition and results of operations and involve subjective or complex judgments on the part of management  often as a result of the need to make estimates 
the following areas require the use of judgments and estimates membership cancellation rates  deferred marketing costs  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  estimation of remaining useful lives of intangible assets and valuation of deferred tax assets 
estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and various assumptions that the company believes are appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following represent the critical accounting policies of the company as contemplated by financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements located in this annual report on form k 
membership revenue recognition revenues are billed primarily through credit and debit cards 
members who are enrolled in a monthly payment plan may cancel their membership at any time  at which time  the billings will be discontinued 
revenues from these membership programs are recognized when earned 
members who are enrolled in an annual payment plan may cancel their membership in the program at any time and will receive a pro rata refund of the fee paid based on the remaining portion of the membership period 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition sab  deferred revenues are recorded  net of estimated cancellations  and are amortized as revenues upon the expiration of membership refund privileges 
an allowance for membership cancellations is established based on management s estimates and is updated regularly 
in determining the estimate of allowance for membership cancellations  management analyzes historical cancellation experience  current economic trends and changes in customer demand for the company s products and services 
actual membership refunds are charged against the allowance for membership cancellations on a current basis 
if actual cancellations differ from the estimate  the results of operations would be impacted 
membership solicitation and other deferred costs the company s marketing expenses are comprised of refundable royalty payments  non refundable royalty payments  advertising costs  telemarketing and direct mail 
refundable royalty payments are deferred and charged to operations over the membership period in order to match the marketing costs with the associated revenues from membership fees 
advertising costs and non refundable royalty payments  which include fee per offer  fee per sale and fee per impression marketing arrangements  are expensed when incurred 
telemarketing  which includes the cost of third party vendors to solicit members on the company s behalf  and direct mail  which includes the cost of printing and mailing direct mail pieces  are direct response advertising costs which are accounted for in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  reporting on advertising costs sop 
under sop  direct response advertising costs are deferred and charged to operations over the membership period  which is the period of expected future benefit  as revenues from membership fees are recognized 
total membership solicitation costs incurred to enroll a new member are generally less than the estimated total net membership revenues 
however  if total membership solicitation costs were to exceed total estimated net membership revenues  an adjustment would be made to the membership solicitation and other deferred costs balance to the extent of any impairment 
valuation of goodwill and other intangibles the company reviews the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets and assesses the remaining estimated useful lives of its intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the company reviews the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment by comparing such amounts to their fair values 
the company is required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment 
when determining fair value  the company utilizes various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions would cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such an event  the company would then be required to record a corresponding charge which would negatively impact earnings 
goodwill at july   and  was tested for impairment during the quarters ended september   and  respectively 
the company concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired as of july  or as of july   the company determined that there was an impairment of goodwill of million at one of its reporting units due to the change in methodology of calculating impairment under sfas concurrent with downward trends in the operations of the reporting unit 
this amount was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the statement of operations in income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the company assesses the realization of deferred tax assets considering various assumptions  including estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax strategies 
a change in these underling assumptions could impact the results of operations

interest is payable in cash semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  with the first payment due on october  a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the senior notes was used to repay amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility to fund a portion of the lavalife acquisition 
the company intends to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes  including working capital  future acquisitions and repurchases of the company s common stock under the company s stock buyback program to the extent permitted under the indenture governing the senior notes and the senior secured credit facility 
the senior notes offering was made solely by means of a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended  and to certain persons in offshore transactions pursuant to regulation s under the securities act 
the senior notes have not been registered under the securities act and may not be offered or sold in the united states  or to a us person  absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements

borrowings under the senior secured credit facility accrue interest at either the eurodollar rate  or the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate  plus an applicable margin

as of june   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million in addition to its senior secured credit facility 
the company believes that existing cash balances  together with funds available under its senior secured credit facility  will be sufficient to meet its funding requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of june  the company intends to utilize cash on hand and cash generated from operations to fulfill any capital expenditure requirements during reconciliation of non gaap measures management believes that revenues before deferral and marketing costs before deferral are important measures of liquidity and are significant factors in understanding the company s operating cash flow trends 
these non gaap measures are used by management and the company s investors to understand the liquidity trends of the company s marketing margins related to the current period operations which are reflected within the operating cash flow section of the cash flow statement 
gaap revenues and marketing expenses are important measures used to understand the marketing margins earned during the period in the income statement 
however  in order to understand the company s operating cash flow  it is important to understand the primary  current period drivers of that cash flow 
two of the primary indicators of operating liquidity for the period are revenues before deferral and marketing costs before deferral 
revenues before deferral are revenues before the application of sab and represent the revenues billed during the current reporting period less an allowance for membership cancellations 
that is  revenues before deferral for a reporting period include membership fees received in the current reporting period that will be recorded as gaap revenues in future reporting periods and exclude membership fees received in prior reporting periods that are recorded as gaap revenues in the current reporting period 
marketing costs before deferral are marketing costs before the application of sab and sop and represent marketing costs paid for or accrued for during the current reporting period 
that is  marketing costs before deferral for a reporting period include costs paid or accrued in the current reporting period that will be recorded as gaap marketing expenses in future reporting periods and exclude marketing expenses paid or accrued in prior reporting periods that are recorded as gaap marketing expenses in the current reporting period 
neither revenues before deferral nor marketing costs before deferral exclude charges or liabilities that will require cash settlement 
additionally  these measures are not a substitute for  or superior to  revenues and marketing expense prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in light of the difference between revenues before deferral  marketing expenses before deferral and their most directly comparable gaap measures  the company solely uses these measures as liquidity measures and not as performance measures 
revenues before deferral for the years ended june   and are calculated as follows revenues    change in deferred revenues    revenues before deferral    marketing cost before deferral for the years ended june   and is calculated as follows marketing expenses    change in membership solicitation and other deferred costs    marketing costs before deferral    commitments the company is not aware of factors that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity trends  other than the risk factors presented in the forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
the company does not have off balance sheet arrangements  non exchange traded contracts or material related party transactions 
future minimum payments of contractual obligations as of june  are as follows amounts in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years operating leases      capital leases  long term debt   purchase obligations   other obligations total payments due      the company operates in leased facilities 
management expects that leases currently in effect will be renewed or replaced by other leases of a similar nature and term

forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about the industry in which the company operates and the company s management s beliefs and assumptions 
these forward looking statements include statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and can be identified by the use of words such as believe  expect  estimate  project  continue or anticipate 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  cannot be foreseen and reflect future business decisions that are subject to change 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
among the many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements are o higher than expected membership cancellations or lower than expected membership renewal rates  o changes in the marketing techniques of credit card issuers  o increases in the level of commission rates and other compensation required by marketing partners to actively market with the company  o potential reserve requirements by business partners such as the company s credit card processors  o unanticipated termination of marketing agreements  o the extent to which the company can continue to successfully develop and market new products and services and introduce them in a timely basis  o the company s ability to integrate acquired businesses into the company s management and operations and operate successfully  o unanticipated changes in or termination of the company s ability to process revenues through third parties  including credit card processors and bank card associations  o the company s ability to develop and implement operational and financial systems to manage growing operations  o the company s ability to recover from a complete or partial system failure or impairment  other hardware or software related malfunctions or programming errors  o the degree to which the company is leveraged  o the company s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms to finance the company s growth strategy and to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements  o further changes in the already competitive environment for the company s products or competitors responses to the company s strategies  o changes in the growth rate of the overall us economy  or the international economy where the company does business  such that credit availability  interest rates  consumer spending and related consumer debt are impacted  o additional government regulations and changes to existing government regulations of the company s industry  o the company s ability to compete with other companies that have financial or other advantages  o adverse movement of foreign exchange rates  o the company s ability to attract and retain active members and users  o adverse results of litigation or regulatory matters  and o new accounting pronouncements 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control  and  therefore  its business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by these factors 
the company cautions that such factors are not exclusive

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate the company has a senior secured credit facility that allows borrowings of up to million 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facility accrue interest at either the eurodollar rate or the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus an applicable margin 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this senior secured credit facility as of june  as of june   availability under the senior secured credit facility was reduced by an outstanding letter of credit of million and one year s worth of interest on the senior notes 
as of june   the availability under the senior secured credit facility is approximately million 
management believes that an increase in the eurodollar rate  the prime rate or the federal funds rate would not be material to the company s financial position or its results of operations 
if the company is not able to renew its existing credit facility agreement  which matures on march   it is possible that any replacement lending facility obtained by the company may be more sensitive to interest rate changes 
in addition  the company has million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the convertible notes and the senior notes pay interest in cash semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year 
the fair value of the fixed interest instruments are affected by changes in interest rates  and with respect to the convertible notes  are also affected by changes in the company s stock price and volatility 
the company does not currently hedge interest rates with respect to its outstanding debt 
as of june   the carrying value of the convertible notes and the senior notes was million and million  respectively  and the fair value of the notes were million and million  respectively 
foreign currency the company conducts business in certain foreign markets  primarily in canada 
the company s primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in functional currency other than the us dollar  primarily the canadian dollar 
as the company increases its operations in international markets  it becomes increasingly exposed to potentially volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on the company are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of the company s international business into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
historically  the company has not hedged translation risks because cash flows from international operations were generally reinvested locally 
in connection with the acquisition of lavalife  the company employed policies and procedures to manage foreign currency risks associated with the purchase price  which was denominated in canadian dollars 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
accordingly  the company utilized foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts to manage its exposure related to the purchase price for the lavalife acquisition 
gains and losses related to these derivative contracts were recognized in the statement of operations in fiscal foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to the company s earnings in  and however  given the currency fluctuations in and and anticipated increases in the company s operations in international markets  the company is reviewing its strategy for hedging transaction risks 
the company s objective in managing its foreign exchange risk is to reduce its potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on its earnings  cash flows and financial position 
the company will assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
fair value of investments the company does not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments  as the company s investments are short term in nature original maturities of less than one year 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
however  this does not preclude the company s adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
