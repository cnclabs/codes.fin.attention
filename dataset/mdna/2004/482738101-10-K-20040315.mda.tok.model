item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we develop  manufacture and market mobile satellite communications products for the automotive  recreational vehicle and marine markets  as well as navigation  guidance and stabilization products for defense markets 
our mobile satellite communications products enable customers to receive live digital television  telephone and internet services in their automobiles  recreational vehicles and marine vessels while in motion 
we sell our mobile satellite communications products through an extensive international network of independent retailers  chain stores and distributors  as well as to manufacturers of marine vessels and recreational vehicles 
our defense products include tactical navigation systems that provide uninterrupted navigation and pointing information in a broad range of military vehicles  including humvees and light armored vehicles 
we also offer precision fiber optic gyro based systems that help stabilize platforms such as gun turrets and radar units and also provide guidance for munitions 
we sell our defense products directly to us and allied governments and government contractors  as well as through an international network of authorized independent sales representatives 
we entered the market for mobile satellite antenna systems in initially  we sold our antenna systems primarily to original equipment manufacturers 
in  we began to offer our mobile satellite communications products to customers under the kvh tracphone brand 
that year  we introduced our first kvh branded satellite tv antenna for the marine market 
in  we introduced a more compact antenna for the recreational vehicle market 
in september  we introduced the tracvision a  our first product for the automotive market using our low profile satellite tv antenna technology 
in  we invented the first digital compass for use in sailing vessels 
since then  we have further developed and refined this technology to produce reliable precision navigation systems in military and combat environments 
in  we acquired fiber optic gyro technology from andrew corporation to complement and enhance our existing navigation and inertial measurement systems 
we continue to develop new products for the defense industry 
in october  we introduced our newest tactical grade fiber optic gyro  the dsp also in october  we introduced the tg  our first fiber optic gyro based inertial measurement unit for use in aviation  guided munitions and precision navigation applications 
we expect to provide certain inertial measurement unit products  such as those used in smart munitions applications  in partnership with other companies 
we generate revenue primarily from the sale of our mobile satellite communications and defense products 
we also generate a portion of our revenue from the sale of our legacy recreational navigation systems 
our legacy navigation product line includes primarily digital compass based navigation products for the marine market 
the following table provides  for the periods indicated  our net sales by product line category 
year ended december  in thousands mobile satellite communications defense legacy net sales in addition to revenue from product sales  our mobile satellite communications revenue includes fees earned from product repairs  fees from satellite phone and internet usage services  and certain directv account activation services provided in conjunction with the sale of our products 
we provide  for a fee  third party satellite phone and internet airtime to our tracphone and tracnet customers who choose to activate their subscriptions with us 
under current directv programs  we are eligible to receive a one time new mobile account activation fee from 
table of contents directv for each customer who activates their directv service directly through us 
our defense revenue includes engineering services provided under long term development contracts 
to date  revenues earned from product repairs  satellite phone and internet usage services  directv activations and earnings under long term development contracts have not been a material portion of our revenue 
our defense business is characterized by a small number of customers who place a small number of large dollar value orders 
in the year ended december   our top four customers  including the us military as a single customer  accounted for of our net sales attributable to defense products and of our total net sales 
in the year ended december   our top four customers  including the us military as a single customer  accounted for of our net sales attributable to defense products and of our total net sales 
direct sales to the us military accounted for of our total net sales in the year ended december  and in the year ended december  orders for our defense products typically range in size from several hundred thousand dollars to over one million dollars 
accordingly  our quarterly net sales of defense products usually consist of only a few orders 
each order can have a significant impact on our net sales  and because our defense products generally have higher margins than our mobile satellite communications products  each order can have an impact on our net income that is disproportionately large relative to the revenue generated by the order 
moreover  customers of our defense products are governments and government contractors who generally must adhere to lengthy procurement processes  which make the timing of individual orders difficult to predict and often result in long sales cycles 
government customers and their contractors can generally cancel orders for our products for convenience 
we have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to customers located outside the united states and canada 
the following table provides  for the periods indicated  sales to specified geographic regions year ended december  in thousands originating from north american locations united states and canada europe other total north america originating from european location europe other total europe net sales since  we have made significant investments in research and development 
we completed a private placement of common stock in the first half of and used a substantial portion of the proceeds to develop new technologies  including a low profile satellite tv antenna and a high speed in fiber modulator 
we introduced our first product using our low profile satellite tv antenna technology  the tracvision a  in september a decline in the potential market for our in fiber modulator led us to conclude in the second half of that we should defer further significant investments in this technology until market demand increases 
during this period  we also continued to develop other products  and in october  we introduced our dsp and tg fiber optic gyro based products 
as a result of the more advanced progress of these various research and development initiatives and the significant reduction in our investments in our in fiber modulator technology  we expect that our research and development expense will constitute a smaller percentage of our net sales than we experienced during  and we anticipate maintaining our efforts in the areas of identifying and evaluating new and innovative satellite and navigation products based on our platform technologies  refining products for commercial introduction and improving manufacturing and development processes 
in addition to our internally funded research and development efforts  we also conduct research and development activities that are funded by our customers 
these activities relate primarily to the customization of our defense products to meet customer requirements 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we account for customer funded research as revenue  and we account for the associated research costs as cost of goods sold 
as a result  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
table of contents united states of america  some of our expenditures for research and development activities are not included in the research and development expense that we calculate and present in our statement of operations 
the following table presents our total annual research effort  representing the sum of research cost of goods sold and the operating expense of research and development as described in our statement of operations 
our management believes this information is useful because it provides a better understanding of our total expenditures on research and development activities 
year ended december  in thousands research and development expense presented on statement of operations cost of customer funded research and development included in cost of goods sold total expenditures on research and development activities as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition revenue from product sales 
revenue from product sales is recognized when requested goods are shipped  title has passed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we establish reserves for potential sales returns and allowances  and evaluate  on a monthly basis  the adequacy of those reserves based upon historical experience and our expectations for future returns 
contracted service revenue 
engineering service revenue under long term development contracts is recognized during the period in which we perform the development efforts in accordance with the performance criteria as established under the agreement 
performance is determined principally by comparing the accumulated costs incurred to date with management s estimate of total cost to complete the contracted work 
revisions to costs and income estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that require revision become known 
any advance payments arising from such long term development contracts are deferred and recognized as revenue when earned 
if  in any period  estimated total costs under a contract indicate a loss  then such loss is provided for in that period 
to date  contracted service revenue has not been a significant portion of our total revenue 
product service revenue 
revenue from services other than under long term development contracts is recognized when completed services are provided to the customer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to date  product service revenue has not been a significant portion of our total revenue 
satellite activation and usage revenue 
service activation revenue is recognized at the time of activation 
satellite connectivity and usage revenue is recognized when services are provided to subscribers 
to date  satellite activation and usage revenue has not been a significant portion of our total revenue 
accounts receivable our estimate for allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is primarily based on specific  historical criteria 
we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
we make judgments  based on facts and circumstances  regarding the need to 
table of contents record a specific reserve for that customer against amounts owed to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to collect 
we also provide for a general reserve based on an aging analysis of our accounts receivable 
we evaluate these reserves on a monthly basis and adjust them as we receive additional information that impacts the amount reserved 
if circumstances change  we could change our estimates of the recoverability of amounts owed to us by a material amount 
inventories inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review current quantities on hand  actual and projected sales volumes and anticipated selling prices on products and write down slow moving and or obsolete inventory to its net realizable value 
generally  our inventory does not become obsolete because the materials we use are typically interchangeable among various product offerings 
if we overestimate projected sales or anticipated selling prices  our inventory might be overvalued  and we would have to reduce our inventory valuation accordingly 
long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for indications of impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of a long lived asset by comparing the asset s carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the utilization of the asset 
if assets were considered impaired  we would measure the impairment by the amount by which the book value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on current market values for comparable assets and projected future discounted cash flows 
the preparation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the preparation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on the history of operating losses in our ongoing business  we determined that it was more likely than not that portions of the deferred tax assets were not recoverable and therefore a valuation allowance was established 
we determined that the remaining deferred tax assets were recoverable based on certain tax planning strategies 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the future if there are changes in the feasibility of those tax planning strategies 
conversely  some portion or all of the previously reserved deferred tax assets could be realized in the future if we generate future earnings during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 

table of contents results of operations the following table provides  for the periods indicated  certain financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative operating loss other income expense  net loss before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit net loss years ended december  and operating summary net loss for was million  or per basic and diluted common share  and was approximately equal to the fiscal loss of million  or per basic and diluted common share 
the results included an increase in sales over  offset by a percentage point decline in gross margin and an increase in operating expenses 
the decline in gross margin from in to in was primarily due to a lower percentage of our higher margin military products and a high initial product cost of the tracvision a the increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increased sales and marketing expenses associated with the strong growth in sales of satellite communication products together with the initial product launch expenses for our tracvision a satellite tv antenna 
additional professional fees and increased salary and salary related expenses also contributed to the increase in operating expenses 
net sales net sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in sales volume of mobile satellite communications products and services  including our recently introduced tracvision a automotive antenna 
growth in our marine and land mobile satellite communication products primarily reflects our focus on the continued development and expansion of sales to major distributors  large account retailers and original equipment manufacturers 
defense sales decreased by million  or  to million in from million in sales of tactical navigation systems  including engineering services  were million  a decrease of million compared to the decrease in primarily reflects a reduction in demand compared to when the us military was preparing for conflicts in afghanistan and iraq 
fiber optic component sales increased by  or  to million in from million in legacy marine and oem sensor shipments declined by  or  to million in from million in the decline in our legacy product sales is consistent with the long term trend line for these non strategic products 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold consists of direct labor  materials  manufacturing overhead expenses and engineering costs related to customer funded research and development 
cost of goods sold increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of increases in sales and unit volume as well as the high initial per unit cost of the tracvision a customer funded research and 
table of contents development costs included in cost of goods sold during and were approximately  and million  respectively 
as cost of goods sold increased in relation to revenue  gross margin decreased to in from in the gross margin decline was primarily the result of decreased sales volumes of our higher margin defense related products coupled with the initial product cost of the tracvision a automotive antenna 
partially offsetting these factors were year over year improvements in product gross margin for our marine and land mobile satellite communications products 
manufacturing overhead  at of revenue in  was comparable with operating expenses research and development expense consists of direct labor  materials  associated overhead expenses  and other direct costs in support of our internally funded product development activities 
all internal research and development costs are expensed in the period they are incurred 
research and development expense decreased by  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  research and development expense decreased to in from in the decrease was due primarily to reduced spending on our photonic fiber initiative 
both and spending levels reflect significant investment in our new low profile tracvision a satellite antenna 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions for in house and third party sales representatives  travel expenses  sales literature  advertising and trade shows 
sales and marketing expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expense decreased modestly to in from in the dollar increase resulted primarily from the costs to support the strong growth of satellite communications sales and the initial tracvision a product launch and promotional activities 
also contributing to the increase were higher sales representative commissions that generally scale proportionately with sales volume  and expanded large account and trade show promotions within the marine and land mobile markets 
general and administrative expense consists of costs attributable to our management  finance  accounting  management information systems  human resources  facility management  and outside professional services 
general and administrative expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expense increased to in from in license and litigation settlement costs  professional fees and salary and salary related expenses accounted for the majority of our general and administrative cost increases 
income taxes in  we recorded an income tax benefit of  compared to income tax expense of  in the income tax benefit recorded in consisted primarily of a one time adjustment of approximately  to reflect the recovery of prior us taxes paid as well as a modest increase in a foreign deferred tax asset associated with our denmark subsidiary 
the one time us benefit resulted from the favorable outcome of an irs audit of our income tax returns for the fiscal years through the loss for did not result in any additional us income tax benefit because we accrued an equal and offsetting amount of tax valuation allowances 
for a further discussion of income taxes  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
years ended december  and net sales net sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in mobile satellite communications revenues made up over half of this growth  increasing by million  or  to million in from million in communications growth reflects the expansion of sales of land mobile products through large national distributors and significant original equipment manufacturer sales volumes resulting from new agreements with major recreational vehicle distributors and manufacturers 
combined sales for our defense navigation  fiber optic gyro components  legacy marine and oem products increased by million  or  to million in from million in defense navigation sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in  fiber optic gyro components excluding defense shipments declined by 
table of contents  or  to million in from million in  and legacy marine and oem sensor shipments declined by  or  to million in from million in the growth in defense revenues was due to the demand for tactical military navigation systems  such as our tacnav light system 
in addition  an increased percentage of our defense systems sales included fiber optic components 
the decline in fiber optic gyro component sales reflected the unevenness of non recurring orders year to year  while the planned decline in marine legacy and oem orders resulted from a marketing shift away from the consumer marine navigation market towards higher volume sales opportunities in the mobile satellite communications and defense markets 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased by million  or  to million in from million in as cost of goods sold decreased in relation to revenue  gross margin increased to in from in customer funded research and development costs included in cost of goods sold were approximately million in and million in during  we realized material and labor cost savings equal to of sales 
cost improvements resulted from reduced component costs  outsourcing of sub assemblies and improvements in our manufacturing methods 
our supply chain and materials requirements planning systems continued to provide us with stronger control over our manufacturing inventories  resulting in favorable material purchase agreements  improved component pricing and increased inventory turns  which rose to turns from turns during the previous year 
manufacturing overhead spending decreased slightly from the prior year and overhead spending declined as a percentage of sales to in from in improved manufacturing spending reflects favorable overhead spending and improved capacity utilization at our manufacturing facilities at our headquarters in middletown  rhode island and in tinley park  illinois 
our largest productivity gain occurred at our rhode island manufacturing facility  where overhead spending grew modestly  while production rose by in from levels 
operating expenses research and development expense increased by  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  research and development expense decreased to in from in the same period in internally funded development costs associated with our low profile antenna and active fiber projects for each of and represented approximately of total research and development spending in and we made significant progress in the development of our low profile antenna in and announced the product in january telecommunications market conditions forced us to dramatically slow our active fiber high speed modulator project 
other research and development expense increased approximately  as a result of decreased customer funding and new hires 
sales and marketing expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expense decreased to in from in the majority of the cost increase was related to variable selling expenses such as third party sales commissions  trade show costs  media  and the expense of new product introductions 
we utilize a third party distribution network  which augments our in house resources 
third party distribution allows us to grow with fewer in house sales personnel and enables us to take advantage of third party sales resources and their geographic market presence 
in  we also entered into oem agreements with leading recreational vehicle coach manufacturers that allowed us to leverage their sales volumes to increase our product sales 
oem customers provide significant sales volume potential and require a proportionately smaller investment in sales support costs per dollar of revenue than lower volume customers 
general and administrative expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expense decreased slightly to in from in cost increases reflect annual salary increases  key hires  rising professional fees resulting from compliance with new regulations contained in the sarbanes oxley act  and professional fees associated with general law support for patent filings  contracts and other legal matters 
interest income reflected the interest earned by investing excess cash in fully insured  federal short term obligations 
interest expense was made up of interest charges related to our mortgage loan and the commitment fee associated with the unused portion of our asset based line of credit 

table of contents income taxes in  we had income tax expense of  compared to no income tax expense in income tax expense in represented both income tax on income generated by our foreign subsidiary and domestic income tax expense from further adjustment of cumulative domestic income tax benefit 
the total income tax benefit resulting from domestic losses for and was allocated to income from continuing operations and stockholders equity eg  from current year disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and exercise of non qualified stock options  but was fully reserved with a valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations from product sales  net proceeds from public and private equity offerings  bank financings  equipment leases and  to a lesser extent  proceeds received from exercises of warrants and stock options 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in working capital 
on february   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting all associated offering expenses 
we intend to use these proceeds primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes 
for the year ended december   we used million in operating cash primarily to fund our sales  marketing  research and product development activities and to finance working capital requirements 
operating cash uses included million in inventory growth and million in accounts receivable growth 
both the inventory and accounts receivable growth were driven by the overall product sales growth and the tracvision a introduction 
directly related to the growth in our sales and inventory levels  was an offsetting million increase in our accounts payable balance 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   and primarily represents acquisitions of manufacturing equipment required to support sales and product line growth 
equipment purchases during included the acquisition and installation of our new tracvision a production capability as well as additional operational and computer equipment needed to support growth in our rhode island and chicago facilities 
we anticipate that the level of capital expenditures during and the first six months of will grow approximately proportional with sales 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  we received million from common stock issuances under our stock option and stock purchase programs and recorded  in equipment financing debt 
this amount was partially offset by  in principal payments on outstanding long term debt obligations 
for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities decreased by million to million from million in the improvement included the impact of a decrease in the net loss of million and an increase in short term liabilities  which was partially offset by a change from a decrease in accounts receivable of  in to an increase in accounts receivable of million in  a difference of million 
a key success factor in preserving operating cash was our control of manufacturing inventory  which decreased by  while sales grew by over results 
capital spending declined by  from to  as we were selective in making capital acquisitions 
cash generated from financing activities declined by million from to  reflecting the fact that a private offering occurred in overall  in we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
factoring out the million raised in our private offering  our cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and other financing activities in resulted in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million 
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million that we experienced in represents an improvement in our cash flow by million over our results  calculated without the proceeds from the private offering 
the largest factor contributing to the results was the decrease in our net loss 
since march   we have had a revolving loan agreement with a bank 
the agreement originally provided for a million asset based  revolving loan facility 
we amended and restated the loan agreement on july  the loan agreement currently provides for a maximum available credit of million and will expire on july  we pay interest on any outstanding amounts at a rate equal to  at our option  libor plus  or the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus or the bank s prime interest rate 
we pay fees at an annual rate of on up to million of the unused portion of the loan facility 
the loan facility advances funds using an 
table of contents asset availability formula based upon our eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances  less a fixed reserve amount 
we may terminate the loan agreement prior to its full term  provided we give days written notice to the bank 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility 
on january   we entered into a mortgage loan in the amount of million 
the note term is years  with a principal amortization of years at a fixed rate of interest of 
land  building and improvements secure the mortgage loan 
the monthly mortgage payment is  including interest and principal 
due to the difference in the term of the note and amortization of the principal  a balloon payment of million is due on february  we paid principal of  in and  in as of december   million of loan principal remained outstanding 
we believe that the million net proceeds from our february  equity offering  together with our existing working capital  will be adequate to meet planned operating and capital requirements through at least the end of however  as the need or opportunity arises  we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private sales of securities or through additional debt financing 
there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain any additional funding or that such funding will be available on acceptable terms 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued a tentative decision to require companies to expense the fair value of all employee equity based awards granted  modified or settled 
the tentatively determined requirements would be effective for public companies beginning in the first quarter of and would require any options issued or vesting on or after january  to be recognized as compensation expense 
the fasb has not yet determined the valuation model required to be adopted 
we believe the adoption of this proposed statement could have a material effect upon our financial results beginning in the first quarter of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december   our contractual commitments consisted of a mortgage note payable  facility leases and equipment leases 
the principal repayment of the mortgage note is based on a year amortization schedule  but the term is years  requiring a balloon payment of million on february  there are no loan to value covenants in the loan that would require early pay down of the mortgage if the market value of the property should decline 
we are also obligated under multi year facility leases that terminate in our other operating leases represent vehicle and equipment operating leases 
the following table summarizes our obligations under these commitments at december  payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands mortgage and other loans facility lease obligations operating lease obligations total we have not entered into any off balance sheet commercial commitments  such as standby letters of credit  guarantees or standby repurchase obligations 

table of contents risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business 
if any of these risks  or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not significant  develops into an actual event  then our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if that happens  the market price of our common stock could decline 
we may not be profitable in the future 
we have a history of unprofitable operations 
although we generated net income during four of the last six fiscal quarters  we incurred net losses of million in both and and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the market for our mobile satellite tv products for minivans  suvs and other passenger vehicles is new and emerging  and our business may not grow as we expect 
our tracvision a is the first commercially available  low profile mobile satellite tv antenna practical for use on minivans  suvs and other passenger vehicles  and we began shipping the tracvision a in september accordingly  the market for this product is new and emerging 
consumers may not respond favorably to live satellite tv in passenger vehicles  and the market may not accept the tracvision a the early stage of development of this market makes it difficult for us to predict customer demand accurately 
for example  sales of the tracvision a in the fourth quarter of were below our expectations  due in part to production delays resulting from component supply issues in the quarter 
although we believe we have addressed those issues in our production process  similar issues or other latent defects in the tracvision a could adversely affect sales 
we believe the success of the tracvision a will depend upon consumers assessment of whether or not it meets their expectations for performance  quality  price and design 
for example  the tracvision a is designed only for use on open roads in the continental united states where there is a clear view of the transmitting satellite in the southern sky 
among the factors that could affect the success of the tracvision a are the extent to which customers perceive mobile satellite tv services as a luxury or a necessary convenience  the extent to which customers prefer live tv over recorded media  the performance  price and availability of competing or alternative products relative to the tracvision a  customers willingness to pay monthly fees for satellite television service  the adoption of laws or regulations that restrict or ban live television or other video technology in vehicles  difficulties or inconveniences associated with scheduling installation at the point of sale  poor performance arising from improper installation or installation of damaged equipment  and our limited experience with marketing a product to the automotive market  which is substantially larger and more fragmented than our other markets 
we expect that others will introduce competing mobile satellite tv antennas for automobiles 
our tracvision a is the first commercially available  low profile mobile satellite tv antenna for use on minivans  suvs and other passenger vehicles 
any advantage we may have may erode as others enter this market 
in january  delphi corp  a prominent supplier of automotive parts  demonstrated a prototype mobile satellite tv antenna that can be integrated into the roof of a luxury suv 
the product  which delphi announced would be commercialized in coming years  includes antenna technology developed by motia  inc  a semiconductor company focused on enabling antennas for wireless systems providers 
motia expects to offer a separate product for the automotive after market 
motosat has announced its intention to introduce a low profile phased array satellite antenna manufactured by skygate in the second quarter of winegard has also announced a low profile in motion satellite tv antenna compatible with directv 
era technology ltd 
has announced that it has developed a low profile scanning antenna allowing direct broadcast satellite tv services 
these satellite antenna products may have a slightly lower profile than the tracvision a s five inch profile  and customers may prefer antennas integrated into the vehicle roof or antennas with a lower profile 
in addition  delphi and sirius satellite radio announced in january that they intend to introduce in a service offering several video channels through sirius existing satellite radio system 
customers may delay purchasing the tracvision a in anticipation of the release of any of these products 
competition from any of these products could impair our ability to sell the tracvision a and may force us to reduce the price of the tracvision a moreover  delphi s long term 
table of contents relationships with automobile manufacturers may give it a significant advantage in selling mobile satellite tv antennas to those manufacturers 
we must achieve significant cost reductions for the tracvision a to reach our targeted profit margins 
initial product profit margins for the tracvision a have been low 
to reach our targeted profit margins  we must significantly reduce our manufacturing costs for the tracvision a we may be unable to achieve the cost reductions necessary to increase our overall profit margins 
although we have already commenced a cost reduction program that includes volume purchasing discounts and redesigning certain components using lower cost materials and processes  technological or other challenges may prevent us from achieving all of the necessary cost reductions 
moreover  if the price of the tracvision a is not attractive to a broad range of customers  we may be forced to lower the price  which would further impair our product profit margins unless we are able to achieve corresponding cost reductions 
customers for tacnav and our other defense products include the us military and foreign governments  whose purchasing schedules and priorities can be unpredictable 
we sell tacnav and our other defense products to the us military and foreign military and government customers 
these customers have unusual purchasing requirements  which can make sales to those customers unpredictable 
factors that affect their purchasing decisions include new military and operational doctrines that affect military equipment needs  changes in tactical navigation requirements  changes in modernization plans for military equipment  priorities for current battlefield operations  delays in military procurement schedules  allocation of funding for military programs  delays in the testing and acceptance of our products  and sales cycles that are long and difficult to predict 
these factors can cause substantial fluctuations in sales of tacnav and our other defense products from period to period 
moreover  tacnav and most of our other defense products must meet military quality standards  and our products may not continue to meet existing or more rigorous standards adopted in the future 
any failure to meet military contract specifications may produce delays as we attempt to improve our design  development  manufacturing or quality control processes 
furthermore  government customers and their contractors can generally cancel orders for our products for convenience 
even under firm orders with government customers  funding must usually be appropriated in the budget process in order for the government to complete the contract 
the cancellation of or failure to fund orders for our products could substantially reduce our net sales 
only a few customers account for a substantial portion of our defense revenues  and the loss of any of these customers would substantially reduce our net sales 
we derive a substantial portion of our defense revenues from a small number of customers 
in the year ended december   our top four customers  including the us military as a single customer  accounted for of our net sales attributable to defense products and of our total net sales 
in the year ended december   our top four customers  including the us military as a single customer  accounted for of our net sales attributable to defense products and of our total net sales 
direct sales to the us military accounted for of our total net sales in the year ended december  and in the year ended december  the loss of any of these customers would substantially reduce our net sales and results of operations and could seriously harm our business 

table of contents sales of tacnav and our other defense products generally consist of a few large orders  and the delay or cancellation of a single order would substantially reduce our net sales 
unlike our mobile satellite communications products  tacnav and our other defense products are purchased through orders that typically range in size from several hundred thousand dollars to over one million dollars 
as a result  the delay or cancellation of a single order could materially reduce our net sales and results of operations 
because our defense products typically have higher margins than our mobile satellite communications products  the loss of a large order for defense products could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations 
shifts in our product mix toward our mobile satellite communications products may reduce our overall gross margins 
our mobile satellite communications products have historically had lower product margins than our defense products 
in  sales of our mobile satellite communications products grew while sales of defense products declined compared to if this change in the mix profile of satellite communications and defense products were to continue  it could result in lower gross margins in the future 
we depend on single manufacturing lines for our products  and any significant disruption in production could impair our ability to deliver our products 
we currently manufacture and assemble our products using individual production lines for each product category 
we have experienced manufacturing difficulties in the past  and any significant disruption to one of these production lines will require time either to reconfigure and equip an alternative production line or to restore the original line to full capacity 
some of our production processes are complex  and we may be unable to respond rapidly to the loss of the use of any production line 
for example  our production process uses some specialized equipment and custom molds that may take time to replace if they malfunction 
in that event  shipments would be delayed  which could result in customer or dealer dissatisfaction  loss of sales and damage to our reputation 
finally  we have only a limited capability to increase our manufacturing capacity in the short term 
if short term demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity  our inability to fulfill orders in a timely manner could also lead to customer or dealer dissatisfaction  loss of sales and damage to our reputation 
we depend on sole or limited source suppliers  and any disruption in supply could impair our ability to deliver our products on time or at expected cost 
we obtain many key components for our products from third party suppliers  and in some cases we use a single or a limited number of suppliers 
for example  we obtain plastic components for the tracvision a from a single supplier 
any interruption in supply could impair our ability to deliver our products until we identify and qualify a new source of supply  which could take several weeks  months or longer and could increase our costs significantly 
in general  we do not have written long term supply agreements with our suppliers but instead purchase components through purchase orders  which exposes us to potential price increases and termination of supply without notice or recourse 
we do not carry significant inventories of product components  which could magnify the impact of the loss of a supplier 
if we are required to use a new source of materials or components  it could also result in unexpected manufacturing difficulties and could affect product performance and reliability 
any failure to maintain and expand our third party distribution relationships may limit our ability to penetrate markets for mobile satellite communications products 
we market and sell our mobile satellite communications products through an international network of independent retailers  chain stores and distributors  as well as to manufacturers of marine vessels and recreational vehicles 
if we are unable to maintain or increase the number of our distribution relationships  it could significantly reduce or limit our net sales 
in addition  our distribution partners may sell products of other companies  including competing products  and are not required to purchase minimum quantities of our products 
moreover  our distributors may operate on low product margins and could give higher priority to products with higher margins than ours 
we depend on others to provide programming for our tracvision products  internet access for our tracnet products  and telephone  fax and data services for our tracphone products 

table of contents our tracvision products include only the equipment necessary to receive satellite television services  we do not broadcast satellite television programming 
instead  customers must obtain programming from another source 
we currently offer marine and land mobile tracvision products compatible with the directv and dish network services in the continental united states  the expressvu service in canada and various other regional services in other parts of the world 
our initial tracvision a product is compatible only with the directv service in the continental united states 
if customers become dissatisfied with the programming  pricing  service  availability or other aspects of these satellite television services or if any one or more of these services becomes unavailable for any reason  we could suffer a substantial decline in sales of our tracvision products 
the companies that operate these services have no obligation to inform us of technological or other changes that could impair the performance of our tracvision products 
similarly  our tracphone and tracnet products currently depend on satellite services provided by third parties 
we rely on inmarsat for satellite communications services for our tracphone products 
we rely on bell expressvu for tracnet service in north america and telemar for tracnet service in europe 
we also rely on globalstar lp for the satellite return link for tracnet 
in february  globalstar filed for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
in november  the us bankruptcy court in delaware approved the acquisition of the globalstar business by thermo capital partners llc 
globalstar announced that the transfer of some assets has already occurred and that it expects the entire process to be completed upon receipt of us regulatory approval 
there is no assurance that this acquisition will be completed or that the buyer will operate the globalstar business in a manner that will allow us to continue to use globalstar services as we currently do 
if globalstar or any of our other vendors are unable to fulfill their obligations  we would need to seek alternate suppliers 
in that case  we may be required to retrofit or upgrade hardware and software as necessary to ensure the continued operation of the affected products 
we may incur significant delays and expenses in our efforts to make the necessary changes  and those efforts may be unsuccessful 
moreover  we may not be successful in identifying and entering into appropriate agreements with replacement suppliers on commercially reasonable terms  which would impair our ability to offer the affected products 
similarly  we may lose the goodwill of existing customers if any currently installed products cease to work for any extended period 
any such outcome could lead to a substantial reduction in sales 
our mobile satellite communications products depend on the availability of third party satellites  which face significant operational risks and could fail earlier than their expected useful lives 
our mobile satellite communications products depend on the availability of programming and services broadcast through satellites owned by third parties 
the unexpected failure of a satellite could disrupt the availability of programming and services  which could reduce the demand for  or customer satisfaction with  our products 
these satellites face significant operational risks while in orbit 
these risks include malfunctions that can occur as a result of satellite manufacturing errors  problems with power or control systems and general failures resulting from the harsh space environment 
moreover  each satellite has a limited useful life  and the satellite providers make no guarantees that the planned backup systems and capacity will be sufficient to support these satellite services in the event of a loss or reduction of service 
we cannot assure you that satellite services compatible with our products will continue to be available or that such services will continue to be offered at reasonable rates 
the accuracy or availability of satellite signals may also be limited by ionospheric or other atmospheric conditions  intentional or inadvertent signal interference  or intentional limitations on signal availability imposed by the satellite provider 
a reduction in the number of operating satellites on any system  the inoperability of any key satellite or the failure of any key satellite or satellites to provide an accurate or available signal could impair the utility of our products or the growth of current and additional market opportunities 
our net sales and operating results could decline due to general economic trends  or declines in consumer spending 
our operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions 
net sales of our satellite communications products are largely generated by discretionary consumer spending  and demand for these products can demonstrate slower growth than we anticipated as a result of recent global economic conditions 
consumer spending tends to decline during recessionary periods and may decline at other times 
consumers may choose not to purchase our mobile satellite communications products due to a perception that they are luxury items 
if global and regional economic conditions fail to improve or deteriorate  demand for our products could be adversely affected 

table of contents if we are unable to improve our existing mobile satellite communications and defense products and develop new  innovative products  our sales and market share may decline 
the markets for mobile satellite communications products and defense navigation  mobilization and stabilization products are each characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product innovations  changes in customer requirements and expectations and evolving industry standards 
if we fail to make innovations in our existing products and reduce the costs of our products  our market share may decline 
products using new technologies  or emerging industry standards  could render our products obsolete 
if our competitors successfully introduce new or enhanced products that eliminate technological advantages our products may have in a certain market or otherwise outperform our products  or are perceived by consumers as doing so  we may be unable to compete successfully in the markets affected by these changes 
for example  other companies have recently announced their intentions to offer low profile in motion satellite antennas in the near future 
these products will compete with our tracvision a and may offer more attractive performance  pricing and other features 
if we cannot effectively manage our growth  our business may suffer 
recently  we have expanded our operations to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a strain on our personnel  management  financial and other resources 
if we fail to manage our growth properly  we may incur unnecessary expenses and the efficiency of our operations may decline 
in order to pursue successfully the opportunities presented by the emerging tracvision a market  we must continue to expand our operations 
to manage our growth effectively  we must  among other things upgrade and expand our manufacturing facilities and capacity in a timely manner  successfully attract  train  motivate and manage a larger number of employees for manufacturing  sales and customer support activities  control higher inventory and working capital requirements  and improve the efficiencies within our operating  administrative  financial and accounting systems  procedures and controls 
we may be unable to hire and retain the skilled personnel we need to expand our operations 
to meet our growth objectives  we must attract and retain highly skilled technical  operational  managerial  and sales and marketing personnel 
if we fail to attract  and retain  the necessary personnel  we may be unable to achieve our business objectives and may lose our competitive position  which could lead to a significant decline in net sales 
we face significant competition for these skilled professionals from other companies  research and academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
our success depends on the services of our executive officers and key employees 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills and efforts of martin kits van heyningen  our co founder  president and chief executive officer 
if we lost the services of mr 
kits van heyningen  our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
we also depend on the ability of our other executive officers and members of senior management to work effectively as a team 
none of our senior management or other key personnel is bound by an employment agreement 
the loss of one or more of our executive officers or senior management members could impair our ability to manage our business effectively 
competition may limit our ability to sell our recreational vehicle and marine satellite communications products and defense products 
the mobile satellite communications markets and defense navigation  guidance and stabilization markets in which we participate are very competitive  and we expect this competition to persist and intensify in the future 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  which could impair our ability to sell our products 
to remain competitive  we must enhance our existing products and develop new products  and we 
table of contents may have to reduce the prices of our products 
moreover  new competitors may emerge  and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of those product lines 
in the defense navigation  guidance and stabilization markets  we compete primarily with honeywell international inc  kearfott guidance navigation corporation  leica microsystems ag  northrop grumman corporation and smiths group plc 
in the market for mobile satellite communications products  we compete with a variety of companies 
in the land mobile market for satellite tv communications equipment  we compete directly with king controls  motosat  tracstar systems  inc  and winegard company 
in the land mobile market for internet communications equipment  we compete directly with hughes electronics corporations 
s direcway service and indirectly with cellular telephone service providers  whose services are substantially cheaper than tracnet 
in the marine market for satellite tv communications equipment  we compete with navigator technology  orbit satellite television radio network and sea tel 
in the marine market for telephone  fax  data and internet communications equipment  we compete with furuno electric co  ltd  globalstar lp  iridium satellite llc  japan radio company and nera asa 
among the factors that may affect our ability to compete in our markets are the following many of our primary competitors are well established companies that have substantially greater financial  managerial  technical  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do  product improvements or price reductions by competitors may weaken customer acceptance of our products  and our competitors may have lower production costs than we do  which may enable them to compete more aggressively in offering discounts and other promotions 
our international business operations expose us to a number of difficulties in coordinating our activities abroad and in dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
sales to customers outside the united states and canada accounted for approximately  and of our net sales in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have only one foreign sales office  which is located in denmark  and we otherwise support our international sales from our operations in the united states 
our limited operations in foreign countries may impair our ability to compete successfully in international markets and to meet the service and support needs of our customers in countries where we have no infrastructure 
we are subject to a number of risks associated with our international business activities  which may increase our costs and require significant management attention 
these risks include technical challenges we may face in adapting our mobile satellite communication products to function with different satellite services and technology in use in various regions around the world  including multiple satellite services in europe  restrictions on the sale of certain defense products to foreign military and government customers  additional costs and delays associated with obtaining approvals and licenses under applicable export regulations  increased costs of providing customer support in multiple languages  satisfaction of international regulatory requirements and procurement of any necessary licenses or permits  more limited protection of our intellectual property  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  which could slow our growth in international markets  potentially longer sales cycles  which could slow our revenue growth from international sales  potentially longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  losses arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and 
table of contents economic and political instability in some international markets 
if we are unable to obtain adequate product liability insurance  we may have to pay significant monetary damages in a successful product liability claim against us 
the development and sale of mobile satellite communication products and defense products entail an inherent risk of product liability 
for example  consumers may ignore laws or warnings not to watch satellite television while driving and  as a result  may become involved in serious accidents  for which they may seek to hold us responsible 
product liability insurance is generally expensive for companies such as ours 
accordingly  we maintain only limited product liability insurance coverage for our products 
our current levels of insurance or any insurance we may subsequently obtain may not provide us with adequate coverage against potential claims  such as claims by those involved in accidents caused by drivers watching television 
in addition  we may be unable to renew our policies on commercially reasonable terms or obtain additional product liability insurance on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are exposed to product liability claims for which we have insufficient insurance  we may be required to pay significant damages  which could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are required to account for stock options as a compensation expense  our reported net income and earnings per share will be significantly reduced 
we currently expect that changes in accounting standards or regulations will require us to record the fair market value of stock options and other forms of equity compensation as a compensation expense in our financial statements 
we currently grant all options with an exercise price equal to fair market value and do not record compensation expense in connection with the grants 
accordingly  if such a change occurs  our reported net income and earnings per share will be reduced 
exports of our defense products are subject to the international traffic in arms regulations and require a license from the us department of state prior to shipment 
we must comply with the united states export administration regulations and the international traffic in arms regulations  or itar 
our products that have military or strategic applications are on the munitions list of the itar and require an individual validated license in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions 
any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products  and we may cease to be able to procure export licenses for our products under existing regulations 
the length of time required by the licensing process can vary  potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue 
any restriction on the export of a significant product line or a significant amount of our products could cause a significant reduction in net sales 
our business may suffer if we cannot protect our proprietary technology 
our ability to compete depends significantly upon our patents  our source code and our other proprietary technology 
the steps we have taken to protect our technology may be inadequate to prevent others from using what we regard as our technology to compete with us 
our patents could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and the rights we have under our patents could provide no competitive advantages 
existing trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws offer only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary technology to the same extent as the laws of the united states  which could increase the likelihood of misappropriation 
furthermore  other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating our intellectual property rights 
any misappropriation of our technology or the development of competing technology could seriously harm our competitive position  which could lead to a substantial reduction in net sales 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome  disruptive and expensive  distract the attention of management  and there can be no assurance that we would prevail 
also  we have delivered certain technical data and information to the us government under procurement contracts  and it may have unlimited rights to use that technical data and information 
there can be no assurance that the us government will not authorize others to use that data and information to compete with us 

table of contents claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and financial condition 
our industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents  patents that may be issued in the future  or other intellectual property rights of others 
we do not generally conduct exhaustive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties 
in addition  product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
from time to time we have faced claims by third parties that our products or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights  and we may face similar claims in the future 
any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract the attention of our management 
if any of our products are found to violate third party proprietary rights  we may be required to pay substantial damages 
in addition  we may be required to re engineer our products or obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products 
any efforts to re engineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful  which would prevent us from selling our products  and  in any case  could substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may require additional financing  which may be difficult to obtain 
in the future we may require additional capital to fund our operations  carry out our business strategy  and sustain our business 
for example  we may require funds to expand manufacturing operations to meet additional demand for our mobile satellite communications products  and we may need funds to promote our new tracvision a product 
our existing and anticipated sources of capital may be insufficient for our needs  and we may be unable to access additional capital when needed 
our future capital requirements will depend upon customer demand  competitive conditions  regulatory and technological developments  magnitude and variability of our revenue  and equipment costs and other costs associated with the development and manufacture of our products 
we may be unable to obtain additional capital on terms that are favorable or even acceptable to us 
any failure to raise capital as we need it may require us to delay or abandon marketing  product development and other plans 
we may fail to commercialize our photonic fiber development projects 
our significant investments in the development of photonic fiber technology have not resulted in the commercialization of any new products 
a decline in the potential market for a high speed in fiber modulator led us to conclude in the second half of that we should defer further significant investments in this technology until market demand increases 
we may never complete the technological development necessary to commercialize the product 
fluctuations in our quarterly net sales and results of operations could depress the market price of our common stock 
we have experienced significant fluctuations in our net sales and results of operations from one quarter to the next 
our future net sales and results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
accordingly  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance 
it is possible that our net sales or results of operations in a quarter will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock could fall significantly 
our results of operations in any quarter can fluctuate for many reasons  including demand for our mobile satellite communications products and defense products  the timing and size of individual orders from military customers  our ability to manufacture  test and deliver products in a timely and cost effective manner  
table of contents our success in winning competitions for orders  the timing of new product introductions by us or our competitors  the mix of products we sell  competitive pricing pressures  general economic climate  and seasonality of pleasure boat and recreational vehicle usage 
a large portion of our expenses  including expenses for facilities  equipment  and personnel  are relatively fixed 
accordingly  if our net sales decline or do not grow as much as we anticipate  we might be unable to maintain or improve our operating margins 
any failure to achieve anticipated net sales could therefore significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
new corporate governance requirements are likely to increase our costs and make it more difficult to attract qualified directors 
we face new corporate governance requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as rules adopted by the sec and the nasdaq stock market 
we expect that these laws  rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more difficult  time consuming and costly 
we also expect that these new requirements will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance 
we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur significantly higher costs to obtain coverage 
these new requirements are also likely to make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve as members of our board of directors or committees of the board  particularly the audit committee 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
our stock price has been volatile 
from january  to march   the trading price of our common stock ranged from to 
many factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  including variations in our quarterly results of operations  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  changing needs of military customers  changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts  the hiring or departure of key personnel  acquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors  changes in accounting principles  future sales of shares of common stock in the public market  and market conditions in our industries and the economy as a whole 
in addition  the stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
when the market price of a company s stock drops significantly  stockholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company 
any litigation against us could 
table of contents cause us to incur substantial costs  divert the time and attention of our management and other resources or otherwise harm our business 
our charter and by laws and delaware law may deter takeovers 
our certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law contain provisions that could have an anti takeover effect and discourage  delay or prevent a change in control or an acquisition that many stockholders may find attractive 
these provisions may also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to take some corporate actions  including the election of directors 
these provisions relate to the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock  and determine its terms  without a stockholder vote  the classification of our board of directors  which effectively prevents stockholders from electing a majority of the directors at any one annual meeting of stockholders  the limitation that directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote  the prohibition against stockholder actions by written consent  the inability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary market risk exposure is in the area of foreign currency exchange risk 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our subsidiary operations in denmark 
certain operations in denmark are transacted in the danish krone or euro and reported in the us dollar  the functional currency 
we have not engaged in material formal currency hedging activities  but do have a natural hedge in that both subsidiary revenues and expenses are denominated in the same currency 
any gains or losses from currency transactions have not been material 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity  while at the same time maximize income 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
to minimize this risk we have generally maintained our portfolio in cash and cash equivalents comprised primarily of us government backed treasury accounts in which the weighted average maturity is less than three months 
we do not invest in any financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  interest rate risk is not considered material 
to the extent that we borrow against our credit facility  we will be subject to interest rate risk 
there were no borrowings outstanding at december
