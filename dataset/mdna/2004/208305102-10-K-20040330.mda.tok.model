item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we specialize in the construction  conversion and repair of a wide variety of steel and aluminum marine vessels for commercial and government customers 
for  our new construction segment accounted for of our total revenue and our repair and conversion segment accounted for of our total revenue 
the demand for our products and services is dependent upon a number of factors  including the economic condition of our customers and markets  the age and state of repair of the vessels operated by our customers and the relative cost to construct a new vessel as compared with repairing an older vessel 
a significant portion of our historical revenues has been derived from customers in the gulf of mexico oil and gas industry 
accordingly  demand for our products and services has been adversely impacted since the latter part of by decreased activity in that industry 
this decreased demand has adversely affected our revenues  margins and profits  particularly in our repair and conversion segment  but also in our new construction segment 
although oil and gas prices have been relatively high for the last several years  there has not been a corresponding increase in exploration  drilling or production activity in the gulf of mexico 
we cannot predict whether and if so when these activities in the gulf of mexico will increase 
although there has been a decline in new construction opportunities in the gulf of mexico oil and gas industry  we have been successful in securing work from government sources 
government contracts accounted for approximately   and of our backlog at december   and  respectively 
energy contracts accounted for approximately  and of our backlog at december   and  respectively  and other commercial contracts accounted for approximately  and of our backlog at december   and  respectively 
our backlog was million at december  as compared to million at december  the depressed conditions in the gulf of mexico oil and gas industry have caused a reduction in our labor hours and have adversely affected our financial performance 
our repair business has high fixed costs primarily associated with depreciation of facilities  floating drydocks and the marine travel lift 
as a result  our margins and profits are adversely affected when the volume of our work declines 
these fixed costs have been increased by our expansion into the aluminum business and the opening of our new conrad deepwater repair yard 
the reduced demand and resulting increased competition have led us to bid some work from time to time at margins lower than we would have been willing to accept historically 
in addition  we have experienced inefficiencies associated with the shift in the nature of our backlog to primarily government work which requires more administrative functions than our traditional commercial customers 
we have responded to these challenges by  among other things  aggressively reducing our costs  pursuing new business opportunities  and seeking to operate more efficiently 
in september  we implemented an aggressive cost reduction plan  designed to achieve approximately million in savings on an annualized basis 
this plan includes among other items a salary reduction for management and an increase in employee contributions for health insurance 
in addition  we were able to obtain better rates on some of our insurance programs  and have also increased the deductible on our workers compensation program to take advantage of our excellent safety performance 
in addition  effective march   we amended our employment agreements with our executive officers 
the amended agreements extend employment of the officers through december  and reduce the salaries by  in the aggregate from the levels in the prior agreements including the salary reduction referred to above 
we will continue to seek out other opportunities to reduce costs 
we recorded non cash charges of million as an operating charge and million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in and  respectively  resulting from the impairment of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards board no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as detailed in note to the financial statements and discussed further below 
our new construction projects generally range from one month to twelve months in duration 
we use the percentage of completion method of accounting and therefore take into account the estimated costs  estimated earnings and revenue to date on fixed price contracts not yet completed 
the amount of revenue recognized is based on the portion of the total contract price that the labor hours incurred to date bears to the estimated total labor hours  based on current estimates to complete the project 
this method is used because management considers expended labor hours to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
revenues from cost plus fee contracts are recognized on the basis of cost incurred during the period plus the fee earned 
most of the contracts we enter into for new vessel construction  whether commercial or governmental  are fixed price contracts under which we retain all cost savings on completed contracts but are liable for all cost overruns 
we develop our bids for a fixed price project by estimating the amount of labor hours and the cost of materials necessary to complete the project and then bid the projects in order to achieve a sufficient profit margin to justify the allocation of our resources to such project 
our revenues therefore may fluctuate from period to period based on  among other things  the aggregate amount of materials used in projects during a period and whether the customer provides materials and equipment 
we perform many of our conversion and repair services on a time and materials basis pursuant to which the customer pays a negotiated labor rate for labor hours spent on the project as well as the cost of materials plus a margin on materials purchased 
repair projects may take a few days to a few weeks  although some extend for a longer period 
in late  the price of steel began to increase substantially 
although this increase did not have a material effect on our operations in  sustained higher or further increased steel prices could materially increase our costs and adversely affect our margins and profits or cause potential customers to defer projects 
we have not engaged  and currently do not intend to engage  in hedging transactions for our steel purchase requirements

ebitda is not a measure of cash flow  operating results or liquidity as determined by generally accepted accounting principles 
we have included information concerning ebitda as supplemental disclosure because management believes that ebitda provides meaningful information regarding a company s historical ability to incur and service debt 
ebitda as defined and measured by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income or cash flow provided by operations as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as an indicator of our profitability or liquidity

the decrease in revenue is also a result of difficulties we experienced in completing a commercial project for four vessels  and the disruptive effects this caused on other vessels being built concurrently in the same yard  described in more detail in the next paragraph 
during  the actual labor hours incurred to complete these vessels exceeded our previous estimates  which resulted in less revenue per labor hour in on those vessels 
in addition  although we had a significant backlog in our new construction segment throughout  a significant contract in our backlog was in the design phase and did not transition into production until the fourth quarter  later than we expected 
as a result  vessel construction hours decreased compared to while repair and conversion hours increased by when compared to vessel construction revenue was of total revenue compared to for and repair and conversion revenue was of total revenue compared to in for  of revenue was government related  was energy and was other commercial 
this compares to government  energy and other commercial in gross profit was  of revenue for as compared to gross profit of million of revenue for vessel construction gross profit decreased million  or  for compared to million for repair and conversion gross profit decreased  or  for compared to million for vessel construction gross profit was depressed as a result of an additional charge recorded in of approximately  related to losses on a commercial contract for four vessels that was completed during constructing the hulls of the four vessels was more complex than we anticipated and resulted in delays and increased costs in completing this contract 
in addition  delays in completing this contract interrupted our previously planned sequence of work on other projects being completed concurrently in the same yard and prevented us from performing those contracts as efficiently as we had anticipated in our bids 
as a result  the costs incurred to complete those contracts exceeded our previous estimates  which further reduced our vessel construction gross profit and margins 
in addition  the vessel construction segment was negatively impacted as a result of a significant decrease in production hours associated with less demand for commercial vessel construction jobs as discussed above 
the decrease in production hours was also a result of a delay in transition from design to production on a significant contract in our backlog 
this decrease in hours provided a lower base for overhead absorption  further depressing our margins 
vessel construction gross profit margins decreased to for  compared to gross profit margins of for repair and conversion gross profit for was negatively impacted by disruptions associated with the transition and relocation of our core repair and conversion operations to conrad deepwater 
in addition  the gross margins were depressed as a result of increases in the estimated costs at completion on a significant fixed price repair and conversion contract that was scheduled for delivery during this transition period 
current year repair segment operations also reflect the increased fixed costs associated with the additional capacity at conrad deepwater  which has not generated to date significant increased utilization 
repair and conversion gross profits margins were for  compared to gross profit margins of for selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased  or  to million of revenue for  as compared to million of revenue for the decrease in sg a was due primarily to decreases in legal and accounting expenses  the elimination of employee bonuses and the cost reduction plan discussed above which was implemented in the latter part of the decreases were partially offset by start up costs associated with our expansion into aluminum marine fabrication and repair 
interest expense increased  to  for as compared to interest expense of  for the increase is primarily the result of an increase in the average outstanding loan balance associated with our expansion into aluminum marine fabrication and repair and the development of conrad deepwater 
we expect interest expense to increase in as a result of an increase in the variable interest rates on the term and development loans  described in liquidity and capital resources below 
we had an income tax benefit of million for  compared to income taxes of  for the decrease in income tax expense is primarily attributable to the loss from operations as discussed above 
during  we completed the two step process of the transitional goodwill impairment test prescribed in sfas no 
with respect to existing goodwill 
the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test involved a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units  as defined under sfas no 
 with its respective carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeded the fair value of a reporting unit  we were required to perform the second step of the transitional goodwill impairment test 
as a result of the outcome of the first step relative to the orange shipbuilding reporting unit  we were required to perform the second step of the transitional goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit 
the second step involved comparing the implied fair value of this reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment 
the transitional goodwill impairment test resulted in our recognizing a non cash transitional goodwill impairment charge of million related entirely to the orange shipbuilding reporting unit 
as required by sfas no 
 the million charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended december  there was no income tax effect on the impairment charge as the charge related to non deductible goodwill 
the circumstance leading to the goodwill impairment was a decline in market conditions since the acquisition of this reporting unit 
this circumstance caused lower than expected operating profits and cash flows 
during the first quarter of  we completed our annual update of the impairment test as prescribed in sfas no 
with respect to existing goodwill 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test indicated that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying amount 
as no impairment was indicated  the second step of the test  as defined under sfas no 
 was not required to be performed 
as a result of deteriorating market conditions  rising steel prices and a reduction in the committed future funding of the us army st tug program  operating profits and cash flows were lower than expected in the latter half of based on these trends  the future earnings forecast was revised and  in december  a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized in the orange shipbuilding reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
as required by sfas no 
 the million charge is reflected in our income loss from operations 
there was no income tax effect on the impairment charge as the charge related to non deductible goodwill 
as of december  our goodwill amounted to million  all attributable to our orange shipbuilding reporting unit 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  during the year ended december   we generated revenue of million  a decrease of approximately million  or  compared to million generated for the decrease was due to a million decrease in vessel construction revenue to million for compared to million for and a decrease of million in repair and conversion revenue to million for  compared to million for the decrease in revenue for was primarily a result of a decrease in production hours attributable to decreased oil and gas activity 
vessel construction hours decreased in compared to while repair and conversion hours were lower by when compared to vessel construction revenue was of total revenue in compared to for and repair and conversion revenue was of total revenue in compared to in for  of revenue was energy related  was government and was other commercial 
this compares to energy  government and other commercial in gross profit was million of revenue for as compared to gross profit of million of revenue for vessel construction gross profit decreased million  or  for compared to million for repair and conversion gross profit decreased million  or  for compared to million for vessel construction gross profit was negatively impacted by a charge of approximately  related to anticipated losses on a commercial contract in progress for four vessels 
constructing the hulls of the vessels was more complex  and resulted in more costs  than we anticipated when we bid for the contract 
in addition  the decline in the gross profit of both segments was attributable to a decrease in production hours as discussed above due to less demand for vessel construction and repair and conversion jobs 
vessel construction gross profit margins decreased to for  compared to gross profit margins of for repair and conversion gross profits margins were for  compared to gross profit margins of for selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased  or  to million of revenue for  as compared to million of revenue for the decrease in sg a was due primarily to the elimination of goodwill amortization expense due to the adoption of sfas no 
approximately million in  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  offset by an increase in depreciation and consulting expenses related to an implementation of a new enterprise business system and an increase in legal and accounting expenses 
interest expense increased  to  for as compared to interest expense of  for the increase was primarily the result of an increase in the average outstanding loan balance partially offset by the capitalization of interest related to the development of conrad deepwater 
we had income tax expense of  for  compared to income taxes of million for the decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in income from operations as discussed above 
during the second quarter of  we completed the two step process of the transitional goodwill impairment test prescribed in sfas no 
 resulting in our recognizing a non cash transitional goodwill impairment charge of million related entirely to the orange shipbuilding reporting unit 
for additional information  see the discussion of our results of operations above 
the recording of this non cash charge for the impairment of goodwill resulted in a net loss of million for liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily a result of a decrease in net change in billings related to cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by decreases in net income and increases in accounts receivable  inventory and other assets 
the decrease in was primarily a result of a decrease in net income  increases in accounts receivable and net change in billings related to cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts partially offset by decreases in inventory and other assets and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
we borrowed funds in and in recent years primarily to expand our facilities and to fund the orange acquisition  and not for working capital purposes 
we had net increases in debt of million and million in and  respectively 
our working capital position was million and million at december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures for were approximately million  including million for the development of conrad aluminum  million for the completion of conrad deepwater  and approximately  for improvements to other facilities and equipment 
capital expenditures were million for of which approximately million was for the development of conrad deepwater   was for the completion of the expansion of a construction fabrication building in morgan city  louisiana  and million was for improvements to other facilities and equipment 
for additional information on our internal expansion activities  see item business overview internal expansion 
for  the board of directors has approved approximately  in capital expenditures for the repair and upgrade of existing facilities in addition to the completion of the aluminum facility expansion 
as of december   we had an outstanding commitment of  related to the construction of conrad aluminum 
substantially all of this commitment is expected to be paid within the next twelve months 
otherwise  we have no significant commitments for capital expenditures in net cash provided by financing activities was million for which included borrowings of million  the repayment of debt of million and proceeds from the grant from the state of louisiana of million 
the additional borrowing was predominantly related to the million of long term financing for our expansion into the aluminum marine construction and repair business 
during  we borrowed million in additional long term debt resulting in a total outstanding balance at december  of million 
the additional borrowing was arranged to provide long term financing on recent capital additions  which included the development of conrad deepwater 
we have a loan agreement with a commercial bank  which specifies the terms of the term loan  the development loan and the revolving credit facility 
the interest rates are variable  and interest accrues at our option either at the jpmorgan chase prime rate or libor plus 
the loan agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets  contains customary restrictive covenants and requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios  including a current ratio requirement  a debt to tangible net worth requirement  a minimum tangible net worth requirement  and a debt service coverage ratio that could limit our use of available capacity under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  the loan agreement prohibits us from paying dividends without the consent of the lender and restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
subsequent to december   the loan agreement was amended to relax some of the financial covenants and to increase the margin on libor rate loans from basis points to basis points 
we are in compliance with these revised covenants 
at december   the term loan was payable in remaining monthly principal payments of  plus interest  with a final payment of million due on may  at december   the term loan balance outstanding was million and the interest rate was 
subsequent to december   the principal repayment schedule of the term loan was amended to extend the final payment date to may  such that a final payment of million will be due on may  and the monthly principal payments of  plus interest remain unchanged 
the revolving credit facility permits us to borrow up to million for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including the funding of acquisitions  and matures on may  subsequent to december   the maturity date of the facility was extended from may  to may  no draws were outstanding as of december  on july  we entered into the development loan which provided financing totaling million to fund the development of conrad deepwater 
the development loan included a revolver that converted to a term loan 
payments under the revolver included interest only payments until march   at which time it converted to a term loan to be repaid in monthly principal payments of  plus interest  with a final balloon payment of million due on may  at december   the development loan balance outstanding was million and the interest rate was 
in july  we completed the financing for our expansion into the aluminum marine fabrication  repair and construction business 
the financing includes a million grant by the state of louisiana through the economic development award program edap and million of industrial revenue bonds issued by the st 
mary parish industrial development board 
in connection with the issuance of the bonds  we contributed to the industrial development board the land and buildings at the conrad aluminum yard and are leasing them back along with the items purchased with the bond proceeds  with a right to repurchase the facility or extend the lease 
the transaction is being accounted for as a financing and thus the original cost of the property less accumulated depreciation remains reflected in our property  plant and equipment 
the lease payments will be used to pay principal and interest on the bonds 
our parent company and all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the bonds 
the bonds have a year term and monthly principal payments of  plus interest 
interest accrues at until march   at until june   and thereafter  at our option  at either the jpmorgan chase prime rate or the higher of a  or day libor plus two percent or b the prime rate minus one percent 
remaining industrial revenue bond proceeds of approximately  restricted for use on the aluminum facility expansion are included under the caption other assets on our consolidated balance sheet for the year ended december  the million edap grant requires us to create a total of new jobs by december  and sustain that level through december  if we fail to meet the job creation objectives  the state may recover related portions of the grant 
as of december   approximately million of equipment had been purchased with grant proceeds 
accordingly  a million liability was included under the caption other non current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet for the year ended december  this amount will be amortized into income in future periods over the estimated useful lives of the related equipment and as the specified performance objectives are achieved 
the equipment purchased with the grant proceeds is owned by st 
mary parish and is being leased by us with an option to purchase 
the transaction is being accounted for as a financing and thus the assets are included in our property  plant and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet for the year ended december  the table below sets out our cash contractual obligations at december  in thousands 
each contractual obligation included in the table contains various terms  conditions and covenants which  if violated  accelerate the payment of that obligation 
payment due by the year ending contractual obligation total thereafter long term debt term loan development loan industrial revenue bonds subsequent to december   the principal repayment schedule of the term loan was amended to extend the final payment date to may  such that a final payment of million will be due on may  and the monthly principal payments of  plus interest remain unchanged 
as of december   we had an outstanding commitment of  for the construction of our new aluminum marine fabrication  repair and conversion facility in amelia  louisiana 
during  we amended our employment agreements with our executive officers as part of an aggressive cost reduction plan  designed to achieve approximately million in savings on an annualized basis 
these amendments reduced the salaries of the executive officers by 
in addition  subsequent to december   we further amended our employment agreements with our executive officers 
the amended agreements extend employment of the officers through december  and further reduced the base salaries of the co chairmen of the board 
the total reduction  including the reduction during  was  in the aggregate from the levels in the agreements in place at december  the current minimum annual total compensation under these amended agreements is in the normal course of our business  we are required to provide letters of credit to secure the payment of workers compensation obligations 
additionally  under certain contracts we may be required to provide letters of credit and bonds to secure our performance and payment obligations 
at december   outstanding letters of credit and bonds amounted to million 
we believe that general industry conditions have led customers to require performance bonds more often than in the past 
we believe that we have secured adequate bonding for potential future job prospects 
although we believe that we will be able to obtain contract bid and performance bonds  letters of credit  and similar obligations on terms we regard as acceptable  there can be no assurance we will be successful in doing so 
in addition  the cost of obtaining such bonds  letters of credit and similar obligations has increased and may continue to increase 
our backlog was million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase in backlog is primarily attributable to the award of an million contract by a commercial customer for the construction of two  cubic yard dump scows 
management believes that our existing working capital  cash flows from operations and bank commitments will be adequate to meet our working capital needs for operations and capital expenditures through we also believe that  barring unforeseen circumstances  we should have sufficient resources to meet our cash needs through and our revolving line of credit expires in may and although we do not have any amounts drawn on the facility currently  we believe access to a revolving line of credit is an important part of our available cash resources and anticipate seeking to have the maturity extended before it expires 
in addition  we have large principal payments becoming due on our long term debt in and believe that we may need to refinance some or all of those amounts 
our ability to extend our revolving line of credit and refinance our long term debt will depend in large part on our financial condition and the condition of the credit markets at the time 
we may pursue acquisition expansion opportunities we believe are attractive if and when such opportunities arise 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
due to the relatively low levels of inflation experienced in fiscal   and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results in those fiscal years 
see overview above in this item for a discussion of increased steel prices 
off balance sheet arrangements as of  and for our fiscal year ended  december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as this term is defined in the regulations of the securities exchange commission 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we are engaged in various types of construction under long term construction contracts 
our financial statements have been prepared using the percentage of completion method of accounting and  therefore  take into account the estimated cost  estimated earnings and revenue to date on contracts not yet completed 
the amount of revenue recognized is based on the portion of the total contract price that the labor hours incurred to date bears to the estimated total labor hours  based on current estimates to complete 
contract costs include all direct material  labor  and subcontracting cost  and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs  depreciation  and insurance costs 
indirect costs are allocated to contracts on the basis of direct labor charges 
revisions in estimates of cost and earnings during the course of the work are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts which required the revision become known 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
significant changes in estimates of cost due to adverse market conditions or poor contract performance could affect estimated gross profit  possibly resulting in a contract loss 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on an evaluation of individual customer financial strength  current market conditions  and other information 
if our evaluation of our significant customers and debtors creditworthiness should change or prove incorrect  then we may have to recognize additional allowances in the period that we identify the risk of loss 
long lived assets held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values can be recovered through projected cash flows and operating results over their remaining lives 
any impairment of the asset is recognized when it is probable that such future undiscounted cash flows will be less than the carrying value of the asset 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we are required to test the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment on at least an annual basis 
currently  our only goodwill is that associated with our orange shipbuilding reporting unit 
our annual test will be performed in the first quarter of  and we have not yet completed the test 
in addition to the annual review  we must assess whether goodwill is impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than fair value 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
new accounting pronouncements in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires the recording of liabilities for all legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the normal operation of those assets 
these liabilities are required to be recorded at their fair values which are likely to be the present values of the estimated future cash flows in the period in which they are incurred 
sfas no 
requires the associated asset retirement costs to be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the asset retirement obligation will be accreted each year through a charge to expense 
the amounts added to the carrying amounts of the assets will be depreciated over the useful lives of the assets 
we implemented sfas no 
on january   as required  and it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
eliminates sfas no 
and as a result  gains and losses from extinguishments of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
sfas no 
also updates and amends existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
we implemented sfas no 
on january   and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for cost associated with exit or disposal activities  which is effective for fiscal periods after december  sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with restructuring  discontinued operations  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activities  when incurred rather than at the date a plan is committed to 
we adopted the standard as of the effective date and will implement its provisions on a prospective basis 
in november  fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
as required  we adopted the disclosure requirements of fin as of december  on january   we adopted the initial recognition and measurement provisions on a prospective basis for guarantees that may be issued or modified after december  in january  fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires that companies that control another entity through interests other than voting interests should consolidate the controlled entity 
fin became effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january  for entities created before january   the provisions of fin have been delayed until december  we do not have interests that would be considered variable interest entities under fin item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the risk of changing interest rates 
interest on all of our long term debt including current maturities  amounting to million with an average interest rate of at december   was variable based on short term market rates 
thus a general increase of in short term market interest rates would result in additional interest cost of  per year if we were to maintain the same debt level and structure
