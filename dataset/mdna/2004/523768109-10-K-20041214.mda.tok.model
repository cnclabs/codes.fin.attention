non gaap financial measures operating cash flow operating cash flow  which is defined as operating income before depreciation  amortization  and equity in net income of associated companies  and operating cash flow margin operating cash flow divided by operating revenue represent non gaap financial measures that are used in the analysis below

the company owns of the capital stock of mni  which for financial reporting purposes is reported using the equity method of accounting 
same property comparisons also exclude corporate office costs 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with 
table of contents gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to intangible assets and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information follows with regard to certain of the most critical of the company s accounting policies 
goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the company analyzes its goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein  for a more detailed explanation of the company s intangible assets 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method  whereby deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
the company files income tax returns with the internal revenue service and various state tax jurisdictions 
from time to time  the company is subject to routine audits by those agencies  and those audits may result in proposed adjustments 
the company has considered the alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various taxing agencies  believes its positions taken regarding its filings are valid  and that adequate tax liabilities have been recorded to resolve such matters 
revenue recognition advertising revenues are recorded when advertisements are placed in the publication and circulation revenues are recorded as newspapers are distributed over the subscription term 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
unearned revenue arises in the ordinary course of business from advance subscription payments for newspapers or advance payments for advertising 
uninsured risks the company is self insured for health care and workers compensation costs of its employees  subject to stop loss insurance  which limits exposure to large claims 
the company accrues its estimated health care costs in the period in which such costs are incurred  including an estimate of incurred but not reported claims 
other insurance carries deductible losses of varying amounts 
the company s reserve for workers compensation claims is an estimate of the remaining liability for retained losses 
the amount has been determined based upon historical patterns of incurred and paid loss development factors from the insurance industry

commodities certain materials used by the company are exposed to commodity price changes
