economic factors affecting title industry 
title insurance revenue is closely related to the level of real estate activity and the average price of real estate sales 
real estate sales are directly affected by the availability of funds to finance purchases  predominantly mortgage interest rates 
other factors affecting real estate activity include  but are not limited to  demand for housing  employment levels  family income levels and general economic conditions 
in addition to real estate sales  mortgage refinancing is an important source of title insurance revenue 
we have found that residential real estate activity generally decreases in the following situations when mortgage interest rates are high or increasing  when the mortgage funding supply is limited  and when the united states economy is weak 
because commercial real estate transactions tend to be driven more by supply and demand for commercial space and occupancy rates in a particular area rather than by macroeconomic events  our commercial real estate title insurance business can generate revenues which offset the industry cycles discussed above 
historically  real estate transactions have produced seasonal revenue levels for title insurers 
the first calendar quarter is typically the weakest quarter in terms of revenue due to the generally low volume of home sales during january and february 
the fourth calendar quarter is typically the strongest in terms of revenue due to commercial entities desiring to complete transactions by year end 
significant changes in interest rates may alter these traditional seasonal patterns due to the effect the cost of financing has on the volume of real estate transactions 

table of contents economic factors affecting fis 
revenues from our mortgage loan processing  financial institution processing and auto processing services are closely related to transactional volume of our customers 
we typically earn a negotiated charge or fee for each transaction processed on our systems 
the long term nature of the contracts  the recurring revenue stream and the lack of correlation to the mortgage origination cycle leads to this business being significantly less cyclical than our title insurance and real estate transaction business 
the ability to grow our mortgage loan processing business is directly correlated to the total population of mortgage debt outstanding 
the total population of residential mortgage debt has been growing approximately to per year in recent years  regardless of the volatility of refinance activity 
specific economic factors relating to mortgage debt growth include housing starts and new home sales 
revenue volumes for our financial institution processing business are closely tied to total transactional volume of our customers 
increases in deposit and lending transactions can positively impact our business and thus the condition of the overall economy can have an impact on our growth 
however  even when the economy is weak  there is a base level of transactional volume 
we are also impacted by the decision of financial institutions to outsource the services we provide versus performing them in house 
these decisions generally are based on the size of the institution  consideration of our pricing structure and level of support for our products along with general economic factors that exist at the time 
revenue recognition 
the following describes our revenue recognition policies as it pertains to each of our segments title segment 
our direct title insurance premiums and escrow and other title related fees are recognized as revenue at the time of closing of the related transaction as the earnings process is considered complete 
our agency title insurance premiums are recognized as revenue when policies are reported to us and are recorded as revenue on a gross basis before the deduction of agent commissions 
in addition  we accrue for unreported agency title insurance premiums based on historical reporting patterns of our agents and current trends 
financial institution processing and outsourcing segment 
through our fis subsidiary  we recognize software maintenance and license fees in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  entitled software revenue recognition and sop  entitled modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable 
software licensed with post contract customer support includes rights to upgrades  when and if available  telephone support  updates and bug fixes 
sop  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements 
we determine the fair value of each element in multi element arrangements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
vsoe for each element is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we record deferred revenue for maintenance amounts invoiced prior to revenue recognition 
many of our contracts include a software license and one or more of the following services development and implementation  conversion  programming  maintenance  application management and data processing 
we use contract accounting  as required by sop  when the arrangement with the customer includes significant customization  modification  or production of software 
we use multiple element accounting required by sop and account for certain elements of the arrangement separately as the services are performed based on the element s vsoe of fair value ie  maintenance and certain other services 
for the one or more elements accounted for under sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  we use the percentage of completion method since reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
when our estimates indicate that the entire contract will be performed at a loss  a provision for the entire loss is recorded in that accounting period 

table of contents data processing revenue is recognized as services are performed 
revenue and incremental direct costs related to professional services implementation associated with our data processing service agreements are deferred during the implementation phase and subsequently recognized over the term of the data processing agreement 
revenue in excess of billings on service contracts is recorded as unbilled receivables and is included in accounts receivable 
billings in excess of revenue recognized on service contracts are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenues from default management services are recognized over the period the related services are provided 
real estate information services and corporate and other segments 
revenue from real estate information services and other income are recognized over the period the related services are provided 
specialty insurance segment 
revenues from home warranty and homeowners insurance policies are recognized over the life of the policy  which is one year 
revenues and commissions related to the sale of flood insurance are recognized when the policy is reported 
factors affecting comparability year ended december  our consolidated statements of earnings for include the results of operations of fis  which we acquired on april   and various other entities acquired on various dates during  as discussed in note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net earnings from our financial institution processing and outsourcing segment  which includes fis for the period from april  through december   represented of our total net earnings for as compared with of our total net earnings in the increase in net earnings from our financial institution processing and outsourcing segment in is primarily due to the acquisition of fis 
we expect our percentage of net earnings in our financial institution processing and outsourcing segment as a percentage of our total net earnings to increase in as a result of including a full year of fis operating results in  organic growth we are experiencing within fis and the acquisitions of webtone in the third quarter of  aurum in the first quarter of  and sanchez  which we expect to close in april during the third quarter of  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 for stock based employee compensation  effective as of the beginning of  as discussed in note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
under this method  stock based employee compensation cost is recognized from the beginning of as if the fair value method of accounting had been used to account for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled in years beginning after december  net income  as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 for the year ended december  reflects an expense of million  which is included in the reported financial results 
also during the third quarter of  we recorded million in pre tax expenses relating to the migration of data center operations from fnis to fis and million in pre tax expenses relating to the relocation of our corporate headquarters to jacksonville  florida 
in addition  during  we recorded a pre tax expense of million relating to the write off of intangible assets  software and license fees 
see notes a and b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we realized a gain of million as a result of interactive corp s acquisition of lending tree inc and the subsequent sale of our interactive corp common stock in the third quarter and we realized a gain of million on the sale of new century financial corporation common stock 
year ended december  our consolidated statements of earnings for include the former operations of vista information solutions  inc for the period from august   the acquisition date  through december  also  in  we recorded a million  after tax charge  reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  as a result of adopting eitf and we recorded certain charges totaling million  after applicable taxes relating to the discontinuation of small ticket lease origination at fnf capital and the wholesale international long distance business at micro general corporation 

table of contents results of operations net earnings 
the following table presents certain financial data for the years indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands total revenue total expenses net earnings basic net earnings per share diluted net earnings per share revenue 
the following table presents the components of our revenue year ended december  dollars in thousands title insurance premiums escrow and other title related fees financial institution processing and outsourcing real estate information services specialty insurance interest and investment income realized gains and losses  net other income total revenue orders opened by direct title operations orders closed by direct title operations title insurance revenue is closely related to the level of real estate activity and the average price of real estate sales on both a national and local basis 
real estate sales are directly affected by changes in the cost of financing purchases of real estate  predominantly mortgage interest rates 
other macroeconomic factors affecting real estate activity include  but are not limited to  demand for housing  employment levels  family income levels and general economic conditions 
because these factors can change dramatically  revenue levels in the title insurance industry can also change dramatically 
for example  beginning in the second half of and through  steady interest rate increases caused by actions taken by the federal reserve board resulted in a significant decline in refinancing transactions 
as a result  the market shifted from a refinance driven market in to a more traditional market driven by new home purchases and resales in and however  beginning in january and continuing through june of  the federal reserve board reduced interest rates by basis points  bringing interest rates down to their lowest level in recent history  which again has significantly increased the volume of refinance activity 
beginning in mid june and continuing through december  the ten year treasury bond yield steadily increased from a low of nearly to more than  causing mortgage interest rates to rise  which has decreased the volume of refinance activity 
total revenue in increased  million to  million  an increase of over total revenue in increased  million  or to  million from  million in the increase in total revenue in and is due in part to increases in real estate and refinance activity as a result of decreasing interest rates 
further  the acquisitions of financial institution processing and outsourcing service companies  real estate information service companies and specialty insurance companies and the integration of these 
table of contents operations into our core businesses in and increased realized gains on investments  also contributed to increased revenue in title insurance premiums increased to  million in in  title insurance premiums increased to  million from  million in these increases in and are due primarily to increases in resale and refinance activity as a result of the decline in interest rates through mid year the increase in resale and refinance activity in and has been partially offset by a decrease in the average fee per file 
the decrease in fee per file is consistent with the overall increased level of refinance activity experienced during and however  the overall decrease in fee per file was partially offset by increases in the fee per file in the second half of as mortgage interest rates rose  and the mix of business changed from a predominately refinance driven market to more of a resale driven market 
the following table presents the percentages of title insurance premiums generated by our direct and agency operations year ended december  amount amount amount dollars in thousands direct agency total title insurance premiums our mix of direct and agency title insurance premiums changed in primarily as a result of our acquisition of anfi in march  and the inclusion of anfi s title insurance premiums as direct title insurance premiums in and the acquisitions of lsi and key title in in and  anfi s title insurance premiums were included in agency title insurance premiums 
trends in escrow and other title related fees are primarily related to title insurance activity generated by our direct operations 
escrow and other title related fees during the three year period ended december   fluctuated in a pattern generally consistent with the fluctuation in direct title insurance premiums and order counts 
escrow and other title related fees were  million  million and million  respectively  during  and revenues from financial institution processing and outsourcing services relate primarily to revenues from fidelity information services  inc fis  which we acquired on april  as such  the results of operations of fis are included in the consolidated financial statements for the period from april   through december  see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
also included are revenues from our empower and softpro software products and revenues from our default management services  which include foreclosure posting and publishing  loan portfolio services  field services  asset management services  electronic invoice management and land records 
revenues from financial institution processing and outsourcing services in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in revenues is largely attributable to our acquisition of fis on april   which generated million in revenues from april  to december  in addition  default management revenue in increased million to million as a result of organic growth in the majority of our default businesses and the increasing number of defaults nationally in as compared with the increase in revenue is also the result of including a full year of revenue from empower  which was acquired during november revenues from financial institution processing and outsourcing services increased million in over the increase in revenues is the result of growth in our default management services  particularly field services  loan portfolio services and asset management services 
revenues from real estate information services generally trend closely with the level and mix of business  as well as the performance  of our title related subsidiaries 
revenues from real estate information services in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in revenue is primarily the result of revenues from lsi  which we acquired in february  increases in revenue from our real estate tax services  flood services  property data and disclosure services  and a full year of revenue from our mortgage 
table of contents loan fulfillment services and collateral risk assessment and valuation services  which were acquired during the increase in revenue from real estate information services in is primarily the result of increases in revenue from our property appraisal services  real estate tax services  field services  and mortgage loan fulfillment services and collateral risk assessment and valuation services  which were acquired in the second quarter of in addition  revenues from real estate information services include million of revenue from the former operations of vista for  as compared with million in revenues from specialty insurance were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and include revenues from the issuance of flood  home warranty and homeowners insurance policies 
specialty insurance revenue increased in as compared with as a result of our january acquisition of bankers and fcic  which gave us the ability to issue new and renewal flood insurance policies 
the increase in revenue in as compared with is due to an increase in our home warranty revenue 
interest and investment income levels are primarily a function of securities markets  interest rates and the amount of cash available for investment 
interest and investment income in was million  compared with million in  a decrease of million  or 
average invested assets increased to  million  from  million in the tax equivalent yield in  excluding realized gains and losses was as compared with in and in interest and investment income decreased million  or in to million from million in average invested assets increased in from  million in the decrease in interest and investment income in and  despite the increase in average invested assets in both years  is due to a decrease in interest income reflecting lower interest rates in as compared with and as compared with net realized gains and losses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
net realized gains in includes a million realized gain as a result of interactive corp s acquisition of lending tree inc and the subsequent sale of our interactive corp 
common stock and a realized gain of million on the sale of new century financial corporation common stock 
also included in net realized gains for is an million loss as a result of the disposal of assets in connection with the migration of data center operations from fnis to fis 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net realized gains in includes a million gain recognized on our investment in santa barbara restaurant group  inc sbrg common stock as a result of the merger between sbrg and cke restaurants  inc cke and a million gain on the sale of a portion of our cke common stock in the second quarter of net realized gains in were partially offset by other than temporary impairment losses of million on cke recorded during the fourth quarter of and million recorded on mci worldcom bonds in the second quarter of other income represents revenue generated by our equipment leasing subsidiary 
other income was million in  million in and million in the decrease in other income in and is due to the discontinuation in the fourth quarter of of our small ticket lease origination business 
expenses 
the following table presents the components of our expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands personnel costs other operating expenses agent commissions provision for claim losses goodwill amortization interest expense total expenses 
table of contents our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  other operating expenses and agent commissions  which are incurred as orders are received and processed 
title insurance premiums  escrow and other title related fees are generally recognized as income at the time the underlying transaction closes 
as a result  revenue lags approximately days behind expenses and therefore gross margins may fluctuate 
the changes in the market environment  mix of business between direct and agency operations and the contributions from our various business units have impacted margins and net earnings 
we have implemented programs and have taken necessary actions to maintain expense levels consistent with revenue streams 
however  a short time lag does exist in reducing variable costs and certain fixed costs are incurred regardless of revenue levels 
personnel costs include base salaries  commissions  benefits and bonuses paid to employees  and are one of our most significant operating expenses 
these costs generally fluctuate with the level of orders opened and closed and with the mix of revenue 
personnel costs totaled  million   million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
personnel costs  as a percentage of total revenue  were in  and remained relatively consistent in and at and  respectively 
the increase in personnel costs as a percentage of total revenue in can be attributed to the substantial increase in open order volumes and the incremental personnel costs associated with our acquisition of fis and our various other acquisitions made during  which have higher personnel costs as a percentage of revenue 
in addition  during  personnel costs include million of relocation expenses 
see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
further  as a result of adopting sfas no 
during  included in personnel costs for is approximately million in compensation cost 
see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have taken significant measures to maintain appropriate personnel levels and costs relative to the volume and mix of business while maintaining customer service standards and quality controls 
as such  with the decline in open orders on refinance transactions resulting from the increase in mortgage interest rates during the second half of  we began reducing personnel costs with the reduction of approximately of the title and escrow workforce from july to december of this reduction in title and escrow workforce partially offset the increase in personnel costs in over personnel costs by segment as a percentage of total personnel costs for were as follows for title  for financial institution processing and outsourcing  for real estate information services  
for specialty insurance and 
for corporate and other 
we will continue to monitor prevailing market conditions and will adjust personnel costs in accordance with activity 
other operating expenses consist primarily of facilities expenses  title plant maintenance  premium taxes which insurance underwriters are required to pay on title premiums in lieu of franchise and other state taxes  postage and courier services  computer services including personnel costs associated with information technology support  professional services  advertising expenses  general insurance  depreciation and trade and notes receivable allowances 
other operating expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue to in from in and decreased in from in the increase in other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue in is consistent with the increase in personnel costs as a percentage of total revenue 
in addition  during  other operating expenses include million and million of data center migration costs and relocation expenses  respectively  and million in expenses relating to the write off of assets 
see notes a and b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other operating expenses by segment as a percentage of total other operating expenses for were as follows for title  for financial institution processing and outsourcing  for real estate information services  for specialty insurance and 
for corporate and other 
the decrease in other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue in from is primarily the result of efficiencies gained due to the change in our cost structure following the addition of the chicago title operations 
agent commissions represent the portion of premiums retained by agents pursuant to the terms of their respective agency contracts 
agent commissions and the resulting percentage of agent premiums we retain vary according to regional differences in real estate closing practices and state regulations 

table of contents the following table illustrates the relationship of agent premiums and agent commissions year ended december  amount amount amount dollars in thousands agent premiums agent commissions premiums we retain the provision for claim losses includes an estimate of anticipated title and title related claims and escrow losses 
the estimate of anticipated title and title related claims is accrued as a percentage of title premium revenue based on our historical loss experience and other relevant factors 
we monitor our claims loss experience on a continual basis and adjust the provision for claim losses accordingly 
during the second quarter of  we increased our claim loss provision as a percentage of total title premiums to to cover the expanded variety of title insurance products we offer 
our claim loss provision as a percentage of total title premiums was in and in and a summary of the reserve for claim losses follows year ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance reserves assumed claim loss provision related to current year prior years total claim loss provision claims paid  net of recoupments related to current year prior years total claims paid  net of recoupments ending balance provision for claim losses as a percentage of title insurance premiums we assumed lsi s and anfi s outstanding reserve for claim losses in connection with their acquisitions in the unfavorable development on the prior years loss reserves during reflects the slight increase in loss payments during on previous policy years  resulting in an increase in estimated ultimate losses in previous policy years 
the favorable development on prior years loss reserves during and was attributable to lower than expected payment levels on recent issue years  which included periods of increased resale activity as well as a high proportion of refinance business 
as a result  title policies issued in prior years have been replaced by the more recently issued policies  therefore generally terminating much of the loss exposure on the previously issued policies 
interest expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in is attributable to the increase in outstanding notes payable as a result of the issuance of million  aggregate principal amount of notes in march see note g of notes to consolidated financial statements  which was partially offset by the decline in interest 
table of contents rates 
the decrease in interest expense in is attributable to the decrease in outstanding notes payable and the decline in interest rates 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 we did not record goodwill amortization in and see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill amortization was million in and includes an million pretax write off associated with the discontinuance of two businesses in the fourth quarter of income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before income taxes for  and was  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before income taxes is attributable to our estimate of ultimate income tax liability  and the characteristics of net earnings ie  the acquisition of fis  operating income versus investment income  as well as the elimination of goodwill amortization consistent with sfas no 
the increase in as compared with is due to an increase in the state income tax rate and the effect of foreign taxes as a result of our various acquisitions in minority interest for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in minority interest in and is primarily attributable to increased earnings of our majority owned subsidiaries 
a substantial part of our minority interest expense was as a result of the former minority interest in fnis  which we acquired on september  liquidity and capital resources cash requirements 
our cash requirements include debt service  operating expenses  taxes  capital expenditures  systems development  treasury stock repurchases  lease securitizations  business acquisitions and dividends on our common stock 
we believe that all anticipated cash requirements for current operations will be met from internally generated funds  through cash dividends from subsidiaries  cash generated by investment securities and bank borrowings through public debt offerings and existing credit facilities 
our short term and long term liquidity requirements are monitored regularly to match cash inflows with cash requirements 
we forecast the daily needs of all of our subsidiaries and periodically review their short term and long term projected sources and uses of funds  as well as the asset  liability  investment and cash flow assumptions underlying these projections 
we have million of capacity under a shelf registration statement that may be used  subject to market conditions  to issue debt or other securities at our discretion 
we presently intend to use the proceeds from the sale of any securities under the shelf registration statement primarily to finance strategic opportunities 
while we seek to give ourselves flexibility with respect to meeting such needs  there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit us to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time  or at all 
our two significant sources of internally generated funds are dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries 
as a holding company  we receive cash from our subsidiaries in the form of dividends and as reimbursement for operating and other administrative expenses we incur 
the reimbursements are executed within the guidelines of management agreements among us and our subsidiaries 
our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by state regulation in their ability to pay dividends and make distributions 
each state of domicile regulates the extent to which our title underwriters can pay dividends or make other distributions to us 
as of december    million of our net assets are restricted from dividend payments without prior approval from the departments of insurance 
during  our title subsidiaries can pay or make distributions to us of approximately million 
our underwritten title companies  financial institution processing and outsourcing companies and real estate information service companies collect revenue and pay operating expenses 
however  they are not regulated to the same extent as our insurance subsidiaries 
positive cash flow from these subsidiaries is invested primarily in cash and cash equivalents 
seasonality 
historically  real estate transactions have produced seasonal revenue levels for title insurers 
the first calendar quarter is typically the weakest quarter in terms of revenue due to the generally low volume of home sales during january and february 
the fourth calendar quarter is typically the strongest in terms of revenue due to commercial entities desiring to complete transactions by year end 
significant changes in interest rates may alter these traditional seasonal patterns due to the effect the cost of financing has on the volume of real estate transactions 
financing 
on november  we entered into a new credit agreement providing for a million  year revolving credit facility due november  the credit agreement bears interest at a variable rate based 
table of contents on the debt ratings assigned to us by certain independent agencies  and is unsecured 
the current interest rate under the credit agreement is libor plus 
as of december   million was outstanding under our credit agreement and we have million in borrowings available to us 
our credit agreement imposes certain affirmative and negative covenants on us relating to current debt ratings  certain financial ratios related to liquidity  net worth  capitalization  investments  acquisitions and restricted payments  and certain dividend restrictions 
as of december   we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
on march   we issued million aggregate principal amount of notes 
we received proceeds of approximately million  after expenses  which was used to pay a portion of the  million purchase price for fis see recent developments 
interest is payable semiannually and the notes are due in march contractual obligations 
our financing obligations generally include our credit agreement and other debt facilities and operating lease payments on certain of our premises and equipment 
our purchase obligations for business acquisitions relate to the acquisition of hansen and aurum in the first quarter of for approximately million and million  respectively  the definitive agreement we entered into for the purchase of aptic for approximately million and the merger agreement we entered into with sanchez for approximately million see recent developments 
as of december   our required annual payments relating to these contractual obligations are as follows thereafter total dollars in thousands notes payable operating lease payments purchase obligations for business acquisitions total capital stock transactions 
on april   our board of directors approved a three year stock repurchase program 
purchases were made by us from time to time in the open market  in block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions 
from may   through december   we repurchased a total of  shares of common stock for million  or an average price of 
the amount repurchased includes  shares of common stock purchased from certain of our officers and directors during the third quarter of  of which  shares were accepted as full payment for certain notes receivable  including accrued interest 
in december  we retired  of these shares held as treasury stock  totaling million 
for the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of common stock for million  or an average price of 
in the fourth quarter of  we retired  treasury shares  totaling million 
as a result of an increase in our cash dividend per share we decided to suspend this stock repurchase program effective july   however effective december   we reinstated the stock repurchase program 
on march   we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition of anfi  inc see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on april   we issued  shares of our common stock to alltel in connection with our acquisition of fis 
the common stock issued to alltel is restricted for resale until april  see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on september   we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition of fnis 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on january   our board of directors declared a stock dividend to stockholders of record as of february   payable on february  on april   our board of directors declared a five for four stock split payable may  to stockholders of record as of may  on april   our board of directors declared a stock dividend to stockholders of record as of may   payable on may  all data with respect to earnings per share  dividends per share and share information  including price per share where applicable  in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split and stock dividends 

table of contents additional minimum pension liability adjustment 
discount rates that are used in determining our december  projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension costs were based on prevailing interest rates as of december  similar to prior years  we looked at the moody s aa corporate bond index at that date as an appropriate basis in determining the discount rate 
a decrease in the discount rate used at december  resulted in an additional minimum pension liability adjustment 
as such  we recorded a net of tax charge of million to accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
equity investments 
our equity investments are in public companies whose security prices are subject to significant volatility 
should the fair value of these investments fall below our cost bases and or the financial condition or prospects of these companies deteriorate  we may determine in a future period that this decline in fair value is other than temporary  requiring that an impairment loss be recognized in the period such a determination is made 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
see note a of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of our significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of investments 
we regularly review our investment portfolio for factors that may indicate that a decline in fair value of an investment is other than temporary 
some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is other than temporary include i our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value  ii the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  and iii the financial condition and prospects of the issuer 
such reviews are inherently uncertain and the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline in future periods resulting in a realized loss 
goodwill recoverability 
we have made acquisitions in the past that have resulted in a significant amount of goodwill 
as of december  and goodwill was  million and million  respectively 
the majority of our goodwill as of december  relates to goodwill recorded in connection with the chicago title merger in the increase in goodwill from to is primarily from our acquisition of anfi in march  fis in april  and the acquisition of the minority interest of fnis in september in connection with the acquisitions of hansen and aurum  which were completed in first quarter of  aptic  which we expect to close in the first quarter of  and sanchez  which we expect to close in april  we anticipate that additional goodwill will be recorded 
the process of determining whether or not an asset  such as goodwill  is impaired or recoverable relies on projections of future cash flows  operating results and market conditions 
such projections are inherently uncertain and  accordingly  actual future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash flows 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  we perform an annual goodwill impairment test on our reporting units based on an analysis of the discounted future cash flows generated by the reporting units underlying assets 
we have completed our annual goodwill impairment test on our reporting units at december  and have determined that each of our reporting units has a fair value in excess of its carrying value 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment has been recorded 
such analyses are particularly sensitive to changes in discount rates and investment rates 
changes to these rates might result in material changes in the valuation and determination of the recoverability of goodwill 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment are present  we estimate the future cash flows expected to be generated from the use of those assets and their eventual disposal

reserve for claim losses 
our claim loss provision as a percentage of total title premiums was in and in and during  we experienced unfavorable development of the prior years loss reserves as a result of a slight increase in loss payments during on previous policy years  resulting in an increase in estimated ultimate losses in previous policy years 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations and note i of notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of our reserve for claim losses at december   and our reserve for claim losses includes known claims as well as losses we expect to incur  net of recoupments 
each known claim is reserved based on our review as to the estimated amount of the claim and the costs required to settle the claim 
reserves for claims that are incurred but not reported are established at the time premium revenue is recognized based on historical loss experience and other factors  including industry trends  claim loss history  current legal environment  geographic considerations and type of policy written 
loss provision rates are reviewed periodically and adjusted by management as experience develops or new information becomes known 
our independent actuaries perform projections of required reserves periodically during the year and at year end 
we compare these projections to the recorded reserves to evaluate their adequacy

 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf provides an accounting model for an approach to determine whether a vendor should divide an arrangement with multiple deliverables into separate units of accounting 
eitf requires an analysis of whether a delivered item has stand alone value to the customer  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items  and whether delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in control of the vendor if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item 
companies are required to adopt eitf for fiscal periods beginning after june  companies may apply eitf prospectively to new arrangements initiated after the date of adoption or as a cumulative effect adjustment 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks 
see business investment policies and investment portfolio and note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with our financial activities for the year ended december  interest rate risk our fixed maturity investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
equity price risk the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information below  since actual results could differ materially because the information was developed using estimates and assumptions as described below  and because our reserve for claim losses representing of total liabilities is not included in the hypothetical effects 
the hypothetical effects of changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of financial instruments would have been as follows as of december  a 
an approximate million net increase decrease in the fair value of fixed maturity securities would have occurred if interest rates had decreased increased by basis points 
the change in fair values was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models  primarily duration modeling 

table of contents b 
an approximate million net increase decrease in the fair value of equity securities would have occurred if there was a price increase decrease in market prices 
c 
it is not anticipated that there would be a significant change in the fair value of other long term investments or short term investments if there was a change in market conditions  based on the nature and duration of the financial instruments involved 
d 
interest expense on average debt outstanding would have increased decreased approximately million  if interest rates increased decreased basis points
