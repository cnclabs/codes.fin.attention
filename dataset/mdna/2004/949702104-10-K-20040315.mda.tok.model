table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are principally engaged in the manufacture and marketing of high quality permaclear and ecoclear brand pet packaging resins  fortrel brand polyester staple fibers and wellamid engineering resins 
we believe we are the world s largest pet plastics recycler  utilizing a significant amount of recycled raw materials in our manufacturing operations 
at december   we had annual operating capacity to manufacture approximately billion pounds of pet resins and billion pounds of polyester staple fiber at five major production facilities in the united states and europe 
our operations are classified into two reportable operating segments the packaging products group or ppg and the fibers and recycled products group or frpg 
our permaclear pet resins are produced by the ppg from purified terephtalic acid pta and monoethylene glycol meg and ecoclear pet resins are produced from a combination of chemical and recycled raw materials 
these resins are primarily used in the manufacture of plastic soft drink bottles and other food and beverage packaging 
the frpg produces fortrel polyester staple fibers and other polyester and nylon staple fibers that are primarily used in apparel  non woven  home furnishing and industrial products 
these fibers are produced from pta and meg and recycled raw materials 
demand for both north american and global pet resins continues to grow  driven by new product applications for pet and conversions from other packaging materials to pet 
demand for polyester staple fibers is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber and textile product imports 
imports of products throughout the textile chain continue to negatively impact the united states fiber markets  resulting in a downward trend for us polyester staple fiber consumption  adversely affecting our operating results 
our profitability is primarily determined by our raw material margins  which is the difference between net selling prices and raw material costs 
both pet resin and polyester staple fiber raw material margins increase or decrease as a result of supply and demand factors and competitive conditions 
given our substantial unit volumes  the impact on profitability of changes in raw material margins is significant 
a 
change in raw material margin on approximately billion pounds of resin and fiber sales volume results in an annual change of approximately million in pre tax income 
selling prices and raw material costs each may be affected by actions of our competitors  global economic and market conditions  export and import activity  and the prices of competing materials 
seasonal factors  such as weather and the vacation and holiday closings of our facilities or those of our customers  may also affect our operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our evaluation of the credit worthiness of our customers and the potential risks inherent in their businesses 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  especially in light of the difficult economic conditions facing our customers 
these judgments could vary significantly from actual amounts realized  resulting in changes in bad debt expense and allowances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts will increase or decrease based on changes in specific events to specific customers 
specific events include bankruptcy filings  changes in the customers credit ratings and or other information 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we 
table of contents incurred expenses for uncollectible accounts of million and million in years ending december  and  respectively 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
the physical condition ie  quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing the valuation 
these judgments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements for various reasons  including changes in future economic conditions  customer inventory levels  or competitive conditions that differ from our expectations 
changes in our inventory valuation resulting from such variances would affect our cost of sales 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation for assets is provided based on their estimated useful lives and is computed on the straight line method and the units of production method 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our capital strategy  or changes to our business model could result in the actual lives differing from our estimates  in which case our earnings could be affected 
in  we recorded certain assets of our frpg segment as held for sale 
when an asset is held for sale  it is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs of disposal 
the fair value of the assets could differ from actual amounts received upon disposal 
for additional information on assets held for sale in and their ultimate disposition  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december of  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million  or per diluted share after tax  in order to reduce the carrying value of our abandoned polyester staple fiber spinning and drawing equipment at our pearl river facility to its estimated fair value 
for additional information  see item recent developments impairment charge 
goodwill and other intangibles through december   we amortized goodwill on a straight line method over periods ranging from to years 
effective january   we were required to adopt sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
based on this standard  goodwill is no longer amortized  but is tested at least annually at the reporting unit level for impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
the fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future discounted cash flows 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired 
a comparison is then made between the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas no 
 and the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less  an impairment loss equal to the difference is recognized 
this implied fair value then becomes the new carrying value of the goodwill for future impairment tests 
the estimate of future discounted cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about future operating performance 
our estimates of future discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  our business model  or our operating performance 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize the recorded value of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 

table of contents pension benefits we have defined benefit plans and defined contribution pension plans that cover substantially all employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability asset related to the defined benefit plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates as determined by management within certain guidelines 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
in determining our long term rate of return on plan assets  our objective is to obtain the highest possible return over the long term commensurate with the appropriate level of assumed risk 
in order to moderate the investment portfolio s risk and volatility  we forecast financial market returns over a wide range of potential future economic trends 
a mix of assets is then selected  with equity securities comprising approximately of the total domestic assets and fixed income securities comprising the other of domestic assets 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption and is reviewed annually 
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments at december and is subject to change each year 
holding all other assumptions constant  a one percentage point decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would result in an actuarial loss in of approximately million 
likewise  a one quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligations by approximately million 
unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized using the corridor method as defined by sfas no 
for our domestic defined benefit plans and dutch plan 
as permitted by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  a systematic method of amortization is used to amortize actuarial gains and losses for our irish defined benefit plans 
for the irish plans  we separately identify actuarial gains and losses on the plans assets and projected benefit obligations and use an amortization method  which spreads each year s actuarial gain or loss over a period of five years without regard to the corridor  subject to the minimum amortization requirements of sfas no 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets 
the actuarial assumptions we used in determining our pension benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
environmental liability our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
our policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the accruals represent our best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
the final resolution of these contingencies could result in expenses different than current accruals  and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period 
continued dumping and subsidy offset act of in april  a coalition of three polyester fiberfill producers  including us  filed an anti dumping suit against korea and taiwan 
the suit alleged that polyester fiberfill producers from these two countries were selling fiberfill in the us at prices lower than their own domestic market prices  resulting in material injury to us polyester fiberfill producers 
in march  the commerce department determined that both countries were dumping polyester fiberfill into the us in may  the international trade commission unanimously ruled that polyester fiberfill imports from korea and taiwan materially injured the united states domestic polyester fiberfill industry 
as a result of this determination and ruling  anti dumping duties ranging from to were imposed on all taiwanese polyester fiberfill producers  and duties ranging from to were imposed on most korean polyester fiberfill producers 
these duties are estimates based upon the producer s past pricing histories 
the actual duties are determined retroactively for each year  after year end  based upon the pricing during that year 
importers of polyester fiberfill from covered producers in these two countries are required to post cash deposits equal to their estimated anti dumping duties 
the actual import duty rates  when determined on a retroactive basis  have been below the estimates for most korean producers 
the total amount of import duties actually owed will depend upon the actual rates and the amount of goods imported 

table of contents import duties are normally retained by the government 
however  in october the us congress enacted the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of the cdo 
under the cdo  any anti dumping duties are paid to the injured companies that file claims to that effect 
we received million and million of anti dumping payments pursuant to the cdo in december and  respectively 
in january  the world trade organization wto declared that the cdo is inconsistent with certain provisions of the wto agreement on anti dumping and subsidies 
this declaration is merely advisory  however  and has no legal effect 
the only body that can alter the cdo is the us congress 
to date  the us congress has taken no action to do so 
there is no action that korea  taiwan or the wto could take that would require us to repay any of the import duties that were distributed to us in and for additional information  see outlook below 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements and accounting changes in  a proposed statement of position  accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant and equipment  was issued 
this statement of position addresses accounting and disclosure issues related to certain property  plant and equipment costs and activities 
those costs include expenditures related to property  plant and equipment  including those for initial acquisition  construction  improvements  replacements  betterments  additions  and repairs and maintenance and terms similar to those such as redevelopments  refurbishments  renovations  rearrangements  planned major maintenance activities  turnaround costs  overhauls  retrofits  and rehabilitations 
this statement of position  once issued  is expected to be applicable for fiscal years beginning after december  as currently written  the new statement will require us to write off certain costs previously capitalized that would not be considered under this statement to be directly identifiable with specific property  plant and equipment and begin charging all such future costs to expense as incurred 
this write off  totaling approximately million million after tax or per diluted share at december   would be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
this statement of position  as currently written  would not have had a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary which is the entity subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements of fin apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after december  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the adoption of fin did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value upon origination versus when a loss becomes probable 
the adoption of fin had no impact on our financial statements 
results of operations to total net sales from continuing operations for increased million  or  to  million from  million in due to the following ppg frpg total net selling prices foreign currency translation sales volumes ppg sales volume increased due to the previously mentioned continued demand growth in the pet resin market 
sales volumes decreased in the frpg due to the declining us textile industry 

table of contents total cost of sales from continuing operations for increased million  or  to  million from million in due to the following ppg frpg total raw material costs plant added costs foreign currency translation higher raw material costs for the ppg were the result of increased unit costs due to temporary supply pressures and higher crude oil and natural gas costs 
the frpg experienced the same higher unit costs for raw materials  but this effect was offset in part by lower production volumes 
total plant added costs for the frpg were lower as a result of our on going cost reduction efforts and lower production levels 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit decreased million  or  to million compared to million in the gross profit margin was in compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  in compared to million  or of net sales  in the increase in is due primarily to consulting fees associated with our on going cost reduction program million and increased new product development costs in our frpg million 
in december  based on management s recommendation  our board of directors approved the abandonment of the polyester staple fiber spinning and drawing equipment at our pearl river facility 
as a result of this decision  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of this charge represents a reduction in the carrying value of the abandoned polyester staple fiber spinning and drawing assets at our pearl river facility to their estimated fair value 
for additional information on the impairment charge  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have historically focused on continuous process improvements and have successfully implemented cost reduction initiatives 
since  we have reduced domestic headcount by  while increasing production by and pounds per employee by over the same period 
during  we announced three cost reduction plans as part of our on going low cost business strategy and in response to reduced profitability as a result of increased raw material costs  declines in pet resin prices in our ppg  and continuing declines in our frpg business 
in january  the frpg commenced a plan to restructure its operations  which included a reduction in the number of employees and other cost savings initiatives at our three fiber manufacturing facilities 
we recorded termination costs of million in our frpg segment related to this plan  which was fully implemented in this plan has resulted in approximately million of realized savings in controllable costs in compared to the prior year 
in july  we announced and implemented reductions in compensation and benefit costs 
these compensation and benefit reductions were implemented at all levels  including senior management 
as part of this cost reduction effort  some employer contributions to our defined contribution plans were suspended 
in november  we announced a third plan with cost reduction initiatives that included eliminating levels of management  reducing the number of employees  and other organization and administrative consolidations and changes 
we incurred severance and other termination costs of million in the fourth quarter of associated with this plan 
these last two cost reduction plans resulted in approximately million of realized savings in controllable costs in the second half of compared to our cost structure during the second quarter of for additional information on restructurings in  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we recorded a charge for expected losses on accounts receivable of million and million in and  respectively 
additional bad debt expense was recorded in primarily due to a bankruptcy where we were a sole source supplier and not named as a critical vendor 
our textile customer base continues to face competitive challenges from imports of textile and apparel finished goods that adversely affect their profitability

table of contents total costs of sales from continuing operations for decreased million  or  to million from million due to the following ppg frpg total raw material costs plant added costs foreign currency translation lower raw material costs were the result of lower unit costs  partially offset by higher production volumes 
plant costs were higher in the aggregate as a result of higher production levels  but were lower on a unit cost basis 
during  our operations were negatively impacted by a production outage that increased our costs by approximately million  or per diluted share  and lowered our volumes

for additional information on the production outage  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported operating income of million in compared to million in net interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease was due to a lower average debt balance and lower average interest rates during our effective tax rate for on income from continuing operations was compared to in the principal item affecting our rate was foreign earnings  which are taxed at rates lower than us rates 
the amount of foreign earnings declined in compared to  however  this was offset by the elimination of the amortization of non deductible goodwill 
as a result of the foregoing  net earnings from continuing operations were million  or per diluted share  for the period compared to million  or per diluted share  for we reported a net loss from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  for and  respectively 
we adopted a plan in march to sell our poy business and our small recycled fine denier polyester staple fiber business  the assets of which 
table of contents were previously reported as part of our frpg 
on june  we sold our poy business and reported a loss on disposal 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as required by sfas no 
 we completed our initial assessment of goodwill using the two step approach described in the statement and determined that the goodwill related to our frpg segment was impaired 
as a result  the carrying value of this goodwill was reduced by million to its implied fair value 
the reduction was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our first quarter financial statements 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for  compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for outlook the following statements are forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties below 
we expect that our operating results for the first half of will be better than our operating results from the last half of  both excluding impairment charges  charges related to our new financing  restructuring charges and other income loss 
we believe this improvement will result primarily from our cost reduction programs and improvements in pet resin margins 
we reduced controllable costs by million in the second half of compared to our cost structure in the second quarter of we expect that our cost reduction programs will reduce our controllable costs by an additional million 
controllable costs in first quarter of are expected to be million lower than fourth quarter of we expect the cost reduction programs we have announced to result in cumulative annual savings of million to million by the end of compared to our cost structure in the second quarter of we expect pet resins margins to improve in over the last half of since increased capacity utilization is expected to result in increased margins in the industry 
capacity utilization should improve because increased demand should exceed the minimal capacity additions expected in nafta pet resins demand is expected to grow at as a result of growth in both traditional markets and new applications 
we expect capacity utilization to continue to increase in and since projected demand growth is greater than announced capacity additions 
we successfully implemented two selling price increases  one in our domestic pet resins business on january  and one in our domestic fibers business on february  we have announced two additional price increases in pet resin  one on march  and one on april   totaling nine cents per pound 
these increases are primarily in response to actual and projected increases in raw material costs 
given the competitive nature of our business and other market influences  there can be no assurance that these increases will be fully realized 
we expect the poor economic conditions in the domestic fibers market to continue as imports throughout the textile chain  especially from china  continue to adversely impact this market 
the impact of textile and apparel imports from asia  especially from china  may increase starting in when quotas on all textile and apparel imports into the united states will be eliminated as of january  pursuant to the gatt now known as the world trade organization agreement uruguay round agreement enacted in we expect to receive a payment under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act in the fourth quarter of we expect that the amount of the payment will be less than the amount we received in and there is no certainty that we will receive any payment 
we expect to incur approximately million in pre tax charges in the first quarter of  resulting from costs associated with our prior financings that were repaid 
these charges are principally the result of prepayment penalties associated with the repayment of our private placement notes  waiver fees  and other expenses related to financings that were repaid  charges associated with the termination of the sale and leaseback transaction  and the write off of unamortized financing costs 

table of contents business and financial projections for sales volumes products millions pounds pet resins staple fiber financial dollars in millions depreciation and amortization to interest expense to capital expenditures to tax rate low mid range on october   our preferred stock became convertible to common stock 
this means that our diluted earnings per share eps will be the lesser of a earnings loss from continuing operations divided by the weighted average shares outstanding on an if converted basis  or b earnings loss from continuing operations less the fair market value of the accretion of the preferred stock divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding 
assuming the fair market value of the accretion equals the increase in the liquidation preference  we expect accretion to be approximately million per quarter in capital resources and liquidity net cash used in operations  including both continuing and discontinued operations  was million for  compared to net cash provided by operations  including both continuing and discontinued operations  of million for the change is primarily due to reduced earnings from continuing operations in  higher accounts receivable in  and an aggressive inventory reduction program in the increase in accounts receivable is due primarily to higher volumes in our ppg  increased net selling prices in both the ppg and the frpg  and a reduction in the amounts sold under our receivables securitization program at december  net cash used in investing activities amounted to million in compared to million in capital expenditures were million in compared to million in for information about expected capital expenditures in  see outlook above

in  we received approximately million in gross proceeds from the sale of preferred stock and issuance of common stock warrants 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  simultaneously with the closing of the private equity investment  we refinanced our million senior revolving credit facility 
the new million three year floating rate facility  which was scheduled to mature in june  had no scheduled principal payments 
the cost of these facilities was approximately million 
in each of and  there were million in dividend payments 
on february   we completed million of new debt financings 
these financings consist of a five year million revolving credit facility with an initial annual interest rate of libor plus basis points on outstanding borrowings  a five year million first lien term loan with an annual interest rate of libor plus basis points  and a six year million second lien term loan with an annual interest rate of libor plus basis points 
the term loans have a libor floor of basis points 
these financings are secured primarily by our domestic assets 
the net proceeds from these credit facilities were used to repay substantially all of our balance sheet debt  repurchase accounts receivable  purchase pet resin assets located at our palmetto facility  prepay a raw material contract  terminate swap agreements  pay prepayment penalties  pay expenses associated with the new financing transaction  and provide working capital 
on february   we had approximately million in total outstanding long term debt  net of original issue discount of approximately million

these amounts are as of december  
table of contents as of february   we do not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as special purpose entities  for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
our debt agreements contain financial and restrictive covenants 
the financial covenants require that we maintain available liquidity of million under the revolving credit facility or maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio currently of at least the fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the revolving credit facility  is the trailing four quarters earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization compared to the sum of cash taxes  cash interest expense  capital expenditures and certain payments related to our equity for the same period 
there are certain liquidity thresholds  which must be maintained in order for us to make certain capital expenditures over certain threshold amounts or to settle lawsuits or pay judgments 
other restrictions relate to the amount of capital expenditures  asset sales  the incurrence or guarantee of additional debt  acquisitions  sale or discount of receivables  certain payments and investments  affiliate and subsidiary transactions  payment of dividends and repurchase of stock  and excess cash 
we expect to incur approximately million in pre tax charges  or per diluted share after tax  in the first quarter of  resulting from costs associated with the financings that were repaid 
these charges are principally the result of prepayment penalties associated with repayment of our private placement notes  waiver fees and other expenses related to financings that were repaid  charges associated with the termination of the sale and leaseback transaction  and the write off of unamortized financing costs 
in march   we lowered our quarterly common stock dividend to per share for the dividend payable on march  we determined that this reduced dividend rate is appropriate considering our operating performance in the second half of  our current debt level and focus on debt reduction  and the dividend levels of other companies 
the financial resources available to us at february  included approximately million available under our revolving credit facility and internally generated funds 
we believe these financial resources and other credit facilities will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs for working capital  capital expenditures and dividends 
environmental matters our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
we take a proactive approach in addressing the applicability of these laws and regulations as they relate to our manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
we have identified certain situations that will require future capital and non capital expenditures to maintain or improve compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 
the majority of these situations are found at our largest manufacturing facilities and primarily deal with groundwater remediation  quality of air emissions and wastewater treatment processes 
our policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
while it is often difficult to reasonably quantify future environmental related expenditures  we currently estimate our future non capital expenditures related to environmental matters to range between million and million 
in connection with these expenditures  we have accrued undiscounted liabilities of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which are reflected as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
these accruals represent our best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
in addition  aggregate future capital expenditures related to environmental matters are expected to range from million to million 
these non capital and capital expenditures are expected to be incurred during the next to years 
for additional information  including changes in the accrued undiscounted liabilities  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
we base the measurement of liability on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and take into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  we review these liabilities periodically and adjust them to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 
we believe we are either in material compliance with all currently applicable regulations or are operating in accordance with the appropriate variances and compliance schedules or similar arrangements 
subject to 
table of contents the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  we believe that compliance with current laws and regulations will not require significant capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

actual results may differ materially from those expressed herein 
results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
in addition to those described above  the more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in our business are set forth below 
however  this section does not discuss all possible risks and uncertainties to which we are subject  nor can it be assumed necessarily that there are no other risks and uncertainties  which may be more significant to us 
reduced raw material margins could adversely affect our operating results 
raw material margin  which is the difference between our net selling price and the cost of our raw material  is an extremely important factor in determining our operating results 
selling prices are influenced by competition and capacity utilization  which is the demand for product divided by its supply 
demand for our product is determined principally by growth in end use markets  substitution of our product for other products  economic conditions  and their competitive cost position 
worldwide supply is expanding for both resins and fiber 
any reduction of selling prices  our not achieving announced selling price increases or any significant expansion in supply over demand could reduce our operating results 
any increase in raw material costs see our operations are dependent on the availability and cost of our raw materials below without a corresponding increase in selling price would reduce our operating results 
a material change in demand  supply  general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
the financial condition of our customers impacts our operating results 
our customers include the manufacturers of plastic containers and textile mills  yarn spinners  and the injection molding industry 
the ppg has six customers that represented approximately of the ppg s total net sales in the frpg does not have any single customer that has a material effect on the segment 
if our customers have financial difficulties  this could affect our operating results by decreasing our sales and or resulting in the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
fiber and textile imports continue to adversely impact our margins 
the us and european fiber and textile markets continue to be severely impacted by imports  principally from asian countries 
imports of fiber and fiber products continue to cause an over supply which decreases fiber margins 
the price and volume of imports have and are expected to continue to significantly impact the operating results of our businesses 
the impact of textile and apparel imports from asia  especially from china  may increase starting in when quotas on all textile and apparel imports into the united states will be eliminated as of january  
table of contents pursuant to the gatt now known as the world trade organization agreement uruguay round agreement enacted in our operations are dependent on the availability and cost of our raw materials 
our operations are substantially dependent on the availability and cost of our two primary raw materials  pta and meg 
we currently rely on a single producer for our domestic supply of pta and a limited number of sources for meg 
the effect of the loss of any producer  a disruption in their businesses or a failure to meet our product needs on a timely basis would depend primarily upon the length of time necessary to find a suitable alternative source 
at a minimum  temporary shortages in needed raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be sure that the precautions we have taken would be adequate or that an alternative source of supply could be located or developed in a timely manner 
the prices of pta and meg  purchased pursuant to long term contracts  have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future 
recycled raw materials are purchased from many different suppliers  including some under long term supply contracts 
the prices of recycled raw materials are variable and determined by worldwide supply and demand 
the governmental investigation of pricing practices in the polyester stable fiber industry could adversely impact our operating results 
the us department of justice is investigating pricing practices in the polyester staple fiber industry  and we have been named in various civil actions that allege that we conspired to fix the price of polyester staple fiber 
see item legal proceedings 
the availability and costs of our financing could adversely affect our operating results 
certain events relating to the company or the bank markets could reduce our access to financing and or increase our financing costs 
if current business conditions deteriorated or other events occurred that resulted in a breach of our covenants  all of our debt would become due and payable 
if the institutions participating in the revolving credit facility could not fund due to a disruption in the bank market  we would have to refinance our revolving credit facility in other markets 
if any of these events occur  there is no certainty the debt could be refinanced and  if it were refinanced  we would probably incur increased costs 
if this occurred  our ability to borrow at competitive costs may be influenced by our public debt ratings 
for additional information  see capital resources and liquidity above 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results 
a portion of our operating results occurs in entities where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
when these currencies weaken against the dollar  our profitability and the value of our investment in the foreign subsidiary decreases 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries conduct business in currencies other than their functional currency 
changes in the relative strength of these currencies can adversely affect the profitability of the foreign subsidiaries in their functional currency 
a portion of the net assets of these subsidiaries is denominated in other than their functional currency 
while we reduce our foreign currency exposure by using appropriate hedges  our foreign subsidiaries still have net assets denominated in currencies other than their functional currency and may experience foreign exchange losses 
as a result  a material change in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our operating results 
regulatory changes may affect the demand for our products 
domestic producers of polyester staple fiber produced in the united states and the european union  and pet resin produced in the european union benefit from favorable rules and regulations that affect imports of selected products from certain countries 
we have previously discussed the imposition of anti dumping duties on polyester fiberfill imports into the united states from korea and taiwan see continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdo of above 
imports of polyester staple fiber into the european union from india  korea  indonesia  belarus  thailand  india  and australia are subject to anti dumping and countervailing duties which may be as high as of the selling price of polyester staple fiber 
pet resin products being imported into the european union from indonesia  korea  india  taiwan  malaysia  and thailand 
table of contents currently have anti dumping and countervailing duties of up to euros ton approximately lb in addition  some of the goods produced using our products benefit from favorable federal and or state regulations 
adverse changes in any of these rules or regulations could affect the demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results 
additional liabilities may be proposed by tax authorities 
we have entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of our business 
these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 
it is possible that additional liabilities may be proposed by tax authorities as a result of these reviews and that some of the reviews could be resolved unfavorably 
increases in costs could adversely affect our operating results 
our inability to maintain our low cost position and efficiently operate our manufacturing facilities may reduce our operating results 
failure to achieve our announced controllable cost reductions  or our inability to efficiently operate our production facilities after implementation  may reduce our operating results 
in addition  we have certain non controllable costs where the expense we incur may change based on external factors and increases in these costs may reduce our operating results 
examples of these costs are energy  insurance and pension costs 
energy costs are impacted by changes in petrochemical costs and as these increase  our cost of natural gas  electricity  steam and oil increases and may reduce our operating results by increasing our raw material and production costs 
insurance costs change depending on the market and our experience and pension costs are impacted by the changes in the equity and debt markets 
actual costs for environmental matters may vary from the estimates 
actual costs and future estimated costs for identified environmental situations may change 
given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures due to unknown conditions  changing government regulations and legal standards regarding liability and evolving related technologies  we could have higher future environmental expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk derivative financial instruments we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
for additional discussion of our use of such instruments  see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk because our obligations under our new revolving credit facility and term loans bear interest at floating rates  our earnings and cash flows are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
our interest rate on our revolving credit facility changes based on the amount borrowed and libor 
based on our borrowings at the start of the new facility  a increase in libor would result in an increased interest cost of 
million 
our term debt has a libor floor of so any increase in libor will have no effect until libor exceeds 
a basis points increase in libor when it is or above increases our interest expense by approximately 
million on the term loans 
these changes in interest rates would increase interest expense  reduce operating income and reduce cash flow by the increase in the interest expense 
to reduce this exposure we have entered into a million swap that has been designated as a cash flow hedge  where we have effectively fixed our interest rate on million of our new debt 
foreign currency risk we use foreign currency debt and foreign currency purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial instruments are primarily used to hedge certain accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
if foreign currency exchange rates at december  and adversely changed by  the fair value of these financial instruments outstanding at december  and would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
however  such loss in fair value would be substantially offset by an increase in the fair value of our underlying exposure 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in any potential changes in any underlying hedged amount or changes in sales levels affected by changes in local currency prices
