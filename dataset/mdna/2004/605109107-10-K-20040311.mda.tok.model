item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mission is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company 
we drill for  acquire  develop and produce natural gas and crude oil 
our property portfolio is comprised of long lived  low risk assets  like those in the permian basin  and multi reservoir  high productivity assets found along the gulf coast and in the gulf of mexico 
our operational focus remains on efficient  well managed upstream natural gas and crude oil exploration and production 
we will continue to pursue complementary acquisitions when the appropriate opportunities present themselves 
mission s results of operations for the year included the following financial and operational highlights 
reduced long term debt by million and annual interest expense by million reduced operating expenses per mcfe from in the fourth quarter of to in the fourth quarter of established a new revolving credit facility  making available million for short term borrowings 
sold several high cost oil properties  making available approximately million for re investment in gas properties 
drilled successful exploratory and successful developmental wells that increased reserves enough to fully replace production 
moved in house previously outsourced functions of operations  marketing  accounting  treasury  land administration  human resources and risk management 
as a result of this infrastructure shift  we were able to achieve greater levels of efficiency and responsiveness 
completed building our exploration team of experienced geophysicists and geologists with significant expertise in the industry and our core areas 
hedged approximately of proved developed producing reserves at a weighted average floor price of per bbl and per mmbtu  with additional hedges on production 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income loss net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share on a diluted basis  while the net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share on a diluted basis 
in  our purchase and retirement of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes generated a million gain  million net of tax  on the extinguishment of debt 
see financial condition financing section below for additional information about the debt retirement transactions 
in  we recognized a million goodwill impairment 
oil and gas revenues oil and gas revenues were million in the year ended december   compared to million for the respective period in the table below details the components of oil and gas revenues and their respective changes between the periods dollar amounts in millions  except prices year ended december  change dollars percent oil revenue oil hedge settlements net oil revenue gas revenue gas hedge settlements net gas revenue oil production mbbls    gas production mmcf    gas equivalent mmcfe    average sales prices  excluding hedges oil per bbl natural gas per mcf average sales prices  including hedges oil per bbl natural gas per mcf the property sales in late plus the additional sales in the fourth quarter of are the primary cause of the oil and gas production declines 
gas production increases from drilling  recompletions and workovers done at south marsh island  north leroy and west lake verret partially offset the production declines 
because these projects were completed late in  their impact in is small  but we expect continued production from these projects to benefit our results 
the favorable impact of high commodity prices offset most of the production decreases 
several factors  including instability in the middle east and a cold winter  contributed to the commodity price increases 
costs of oil and gas production in addition to analyzing gross changes in costs  management finds it useful to look at some costs on a per unit basis 
the table below details our costs of oil and gas production by cost type both in dollars incurred and  where useful  in dollars per mcfe  and their respective changes between the periods dollars in millions  except per unit amounts 
year ended december  change dollars percent lease operating expense lease operating expense per mcfe taxes other than income production taxes property taxes other taxes transportation costs depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization per mcfe transportation costs and production taxes relate to specific production  therefore analysis of such costs per unit of total production is not useful 
total lease operating expenses for the year decreased from levels  but increased on a per mcfe basis 
production declines contributed to the per mcfe cost increase 
in gross dollars  the most significant cost reductions related to the sale of properties at auction in november  the sale of the pt 
pedernales field in march  and the sales of the east texas  east cameron and raccoon bend fields in the fourth quarter of the east texas field and the raccoon bend field consisted of high per mcfe cost oil properties 
we expect the impact of the fourth quarter sales to be evident on a per mcfe basis beginning the first quarter of combined with the addition of the low cost per mcfe production from the newly acquired jalmat field  we expect first quarter operating expenses to be between and per mcfe 
production taxes  depending upon the jurisdiction  are calculated using a percentage of revenue or a per unit of production rate 
they vary with both price and production levels 
property taxes are assessed based upon property value calculated at the beginning of each year 
our reduced number of properties coupled with reductions in the assessed values of our remaining properties caused the property tax reduction in assessed values are based upon beginning of the year reserves and the previous year s average realized price 
because our average realized prices in were considerably higher than in  we expect property taxes to increase in because our depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a is calculated on the units of production method  the production decrease resulting from normal production declines and from property sales is driving the overall decline in dd a expense 
the increase in dd a on a per mcfe basis reflected the impact of decreases in reserves due to property sales 
asset retirement obligation accretion expense asset retirement obligation accretion expense is a new category of expense for that resulted from the implementation of sfas no 
the liability recorded for our asset retirement obligation represents the estimate of such costs as of the end of the reporting period 
each quarter  we are required to increase the liability to account for the passage of time  resulting in this accretion expense 
income taxes the federal and state income taxes for the year ended december  was based upon a effective tax rate which represented a change from the effective tax rate of the effective rate  as calculated by dividing income tax benefit by net loss before taxes  was lower primarily because the impairment of goodwill is not an allowable tax deduction 
in december  we have become subject to tax limitations imposed under section of the internal revenue code limitations 
these limitations could impact the potential future realization of our tax net operating losses and other deferred tax assets 
based upon estimates of our recoverable reserves  future production and related taxable income  management has determined that the limitations have not currently resulted in our deferred assets being impaired 
interest and other income interest and other income increased million from a net loss of million reported for the year to a net gain of million reported for the year gains or losses related to hedge ineffectiveness  as computed under the requirements of sfas 
no 
 are the most significant portion of this line item 
a million net loss from hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in while a net gain of million was recorded in a million gain from the settlement of a royalty calculation dispute with the mms was also recorded in interest expense interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the following table details the components of interest and their respective changes between the periods dollar amounts in millions 
year ended december  change dollars percent interest rate swap gain loss interest on notes  net of amortized premium amortization of financing costs interest on credit facility reported interest expense the interest rate swap was cancelled in february  limiting our exposure to interest rate volatility and resulting in a  gain recognized in the first quarter of the march repurchase of million of our senior subordinated notes and their replacement with an million term loan facility currently bearing interest at has generated interest savings of approximately  per month beginning in the second quarter of general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses totaled approximately million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  in  employees of torch performed most of our accounting  operating and marketing functions  and we paid torch a management fee for these outsourced services 
by the end of april we had terminated all outsourcing contracts with torch  decreasing our management fee costs  however  employee costs increased as a result of our increased staffing to replace torch employees combined with severance costs related to the reorganization partially offsetting the management fee savings 
some costs incurred in are not expected to be recurring 
our legal costs were higher as a result of several settled lawsuits and the implementation of the new corporate governance requirements 
we also performed an extensive review of our lease and well records in connection with the implementation of a new land system 
while many of these costs are not expected to reoccur in  our general and administrative expenses are anticipated to remain near levels 
because several of the properties that were sold in were operated  our fees recovered on operated properties will be lower in the future 
public company expenses continue to rise and our salaries and benefits will increase as we grow the company 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income loss net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share on a diluted basis  while the net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share on a diluted basis 
the contributing factors to such losses are discussed below 
oil and gas revenues oil and gas revenues were million in the year ended december   compared to million for the respective period in the table below details the components of oil and gas revenues and their respective changes between the periods dollar amounts in millions  except prices year ended december  change dollars percent oil revenue oil hedge settlements net oil revenue gas revenue gas hedge settlements net gas revenue oil production mbbls   gas production mmcf    gas equivalent mmcfe    average sales prices  excluding hedges oil per bbl natural gas per mcf average sales prices  including hedges oil per bbl natural gas per mcf the expected decreases in our gas production and our realized gas prices  excluding hedges  were the primary reasons for our overall decrease in revenues 
throughout  we sold several oil and gas properties and our production from our offshore properties declines with the passage of time 
additionally  our production was shut in both offshore and along the gulf coast for a few days during september and october when hurricanes passed through 
we sold our interests in the ecuador fields in june the absence of revenues from ecuadorian oil accounts for the majority of the decrease in oil revenues 
costs of oil and gas production in addition to analyzing gross changes in costs  management finds it useful to also look at some costs on a per unit basis 
the table below details our costs of oil and gas production by cost type both in dollars incurred and  where useful  in dollars per mcfe  and their respective changes between the periods dollars in millions  except per unit amounts 
year ended december  change dollars percent lease operating expense lease operating expense per mcfe taxes other than income production taxes property taxes other taxes transportation costs depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization per mcfe transportation costs and production taxes relate to specific production  therefore analysis of such costs per unit of total production is not useful 
total lease operating expenses for the year decreased from levels  but increased on a per mcfe basis 
cost reductions related to properties sold during were significant  but the inclusion of a full year of costs from the properties acquired in the merger with bargo and the june south louisiana acquisition offset that benefit 
many of those acquired properties were high fixed costs properties so that declines in production were not matched with declines in expenses  causing the per mcfe rates to remain high 
production taxes  depending upon the jurisdiction  are calculated using a percentage of revenue or a per unit of production rate 
total production taxes vary with both price and production levels 
property taxes are assessed based upon property value calculated at the beginning of each year 
the most significant contribution to increased ad valorem taxes was the merger with bargo and the acquisition of south louisiana properties in because a full year of property taxes was recognized on those properties in transportation costs represent those expenses incurred to bring production to sale points such as pipeline fees and gas gathering fees 
in  we were responsible for paying transportation for more of our oil and gas sales 
in  torch purchased a large portion of our production and assumed responsibility for transportation costs on the gas it purchased from us 
because our dd a is calculated on the units of production method  the decrease in production is driving the overall decline in dd a expense 
the increase in dd a on a per mcfe basis reflected the impact of decreases in reserves as a result of property sales and reserve revisions 
impairment expense the impairment expense reported in of million was the result of the impairment of goodwill 
the impairment expense reported in consisted of a million full cost ceiling impairment  a write off of the million long term receivable and a  charge for exploration stage mining activities 
both the goodwill and the full cost ceiling impairment are discussed in detail under critical accounting policies 
the long term receivable represented a production payment receivable due from a foreign energy company that management determined was uncollectible in the fourth quarter of income taxes the benefit for federal and state income taxes for the year ended december  was based upon a statutory tax rate 
the effective rate was reduced to  primarily because the impairment of goodwill is not an allowable tax deduction 
additionally  the million valuation allowance on deferred taxes applicable at december  was increased to million at december   because management determined that the portion of deferred tax asset relating to state tax losses generated during the period would not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the projection for future state taxable income  management believed it was more likely than not that we would not realize our deferred tax asset related to state income taxes 
loss on sale of assets the loss on sale of assets of million in was primarily attributable to the post closing settlement on the sale of our ecuadorian interests 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased million from a net gain of million reported for the year to a net loss of million reported for the year gains or losses related to hedge ineffectiveness  as computed under the requirements of sfas 
no 
 were the most significant portion of this line item 
a net gain from hedge ineffectiveness of million was recorded in  while a million net loss from hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in a million gain from the settlement of a royalty calculation dispute with the mms was also recorded in interest expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the following table details the components of interest and their respective changes between the periods dollar amounts in millions 
year ended december  change dollars percent interest rate swap gain loss interest on notes  net of amortized premium amortization of financing costs interest in credit facility reported interest expense the million of senior subordinated notes that were issued in may of were outstanding and accruing interest for an additional five months during the costs of the bond issue were also subject to amortization for the entire year 
the change in the fair value of our interest rate swap created gains in both years  but the gain was larger in because interest rates were decreasing during the year 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses totaled million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december   representing a decrease of 
salaries and benefits were million lower in than in  because of early staff reductions 
in addition  the termination of outsourcing contracts reduced management fees by million in however  these decreases were partially offset by severance costs of million in compared with million of severance and outsourcing contract termination fees in financial condition capital structure we have a highly leveraged capital structure  limiting our financial flexibility 
in particular  we must pay approximately million of interest annually on our long term debt  which limits the amount of cash that is available for exploration and development of oil and gas properties 
in  management began evaluating alternatives to improve mission s financial position 
in  the following steps were taken to enhance our financial condition the march repurchase and retirement of approximately million of our senior subordinated notes financed with a million term loan facility 
the establishment of a new revolving credit facility in june  making million available for short term borrowings 
the issuance of million shares of common stock in exchange for million of our senior subordinated notes in december the sale of high cost oil properties  making available approximately million for re investment in gas properties 
we intend to take additional actions in to continue to improve our financial condition 
among the alternatives that we may consider are a refinancing of the remaining notes  a new credit facility  a merger with or an acquisition by another company  the acquisition by mission of another company or assets  other secured and unsecured debt financings  and the issuance of equity securities or other debt securities for cash or properties or in exchange for the notes 
financing our outstanding indebtedness totaled million at december  the nature of our indebtedness at of december  and is summarized on the table below amounts in millions 
december  revolving credit facility term loan facility senior subordinated notes unamortized premium on notes total debt amounts available for borrowing at december  and under the revolving credit facilities were million and million  respectively 
senior subordinated notes in april  we issued million of senior subordinated notes due on may   we issued an additional million of senior subordinated notes due  with identical terms to the notes issued in april  at a premium of million 
we amortize the premium as a reduction of interest expense over the life of the notes so that the effective interest rate on the additional notes is 
through december   we had amortized approximately  of the premium 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on april st and october st 
we may choose to redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at any time after april  at plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the required redemption price decreases annually to on april  should mission effect a change of control  as defined in the indenture  the noteholders could require us to purchase all or part of the notes for plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the notes contain covenants that limit indebtedness and liens  require compliance with covenants of existing debt  such as our credit facility  limit dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock  restrict payments to subsidiaries defined by the indenture as restricted subsidiaries  control issuance and sales of stock of restricted subsidiaries  restrict the disposition of proceeds from asset sales  and restrict mergers and consolidations or sales of assets 
on march   we acquired  in a private transaction with various funds affiliated with farallon capital management  llc  pursuant to the terms of a purchase and sale agreement  approximately million in principal amount of the notes for approximately million  plus accrued interest 
immediately after the consummation of the transaction  mission had million in principal amount of notes outstanding 
including costs of the transaction and the removal of million of previously deferred financing costs related to the acquired notes  we recognized a million gain on the extinguishment of the notes 
on december   in a private transaction with ftvipt franklin income securities fund and franklin custodian funds income series  we acquired million in principal amount of the notes in exchange for million shares of our common stock 
the stock was valued at per share  the opening price for the transaction date 
after netting out costs of the transaction and the removal of previously deferred financing costs and premium related to the acquired notes  we recognized a net gain of approximately million on this extinguishment of the notes 
we were in compliance with the covenants of the notes at december  the notes require us to comply with covenants of other existing debt if borrowings under that debt exceed million 
as discussed below under credit facility  mission was also in compliance with all covenants of its credit facilities at december  as of december   moody s published mission s subordinated note rating as ca 
in determining mission s debt rating  moody s considers a number of items including  but not limited to  debt levels  planned asset sales  near term and long term production growth opportunities  capital allocation challenges and commodity price levels 
a decline in our ratings would not create a default under our current credit facility or other unfavorable change 
credit facility in  mission was party to a million credit facility with a syndicate of lenders 
the credit facility was a revolving facility  expiring may   which allowed mission to borrow  repay and re borrow under the facility from time to time 
the total amount that might be borrowed under the facility was limited by the borrowing base periodically set by the lenders based on mission s oil and gas reserves and other factors deemed relevant by the lenders 
the facility was repaid in full on march  on march   simultaneously with the acquisition of the notes  mission amended and restated its credit facility with new lenders  led by farallon energy lending  llc 
under the amended and restated secured credit agreement the facility  mission borrowed million pursuant to term loans the term loan facility  the proceeds of which were used to acquire approximately million face amount of notes  to pay accrued interest on the notes purchased and to pay closing costs 
on june   we amended the facility to add a revolving credit facility of up to million the revolver facility  including a letter of credit sub facility the sub facility of up to million 
the facility  which includes the term loan facility and the revolver facility  is secured by a lien on substantially all of mission s property and the property of all of our subsidiaries  including a lien on at least of our respective oil and gas properties and a pledge of the capital stock of all the subsidiaries 
the term loan facility expires on january   and the revolver facility expires on june  the proceeds of the revolver facility are to be used to finance our ongoing working capital and general corporate needs 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under the revolver facility  but had issued  of letters of credit under the sub facility 
subject to the terms and conditions of the revolver facility  the lenders have agreed to make advances to mission  from time to time  prior to the expiration of the revolver facility  in an amount equal to the least of the following in whole multiples of  i million minus outstanding letters of credit  ii the borrowing base as defined below minus outstanding letters of credit  and iii during a cleanup period as defined below  million minus outstanding letters of credit in excess of million 
borrowing base means an amount equal to of the pv value as defined in the facility of the our proved developed producing reserves minus certain other reserves required under the facility 
the borrowing base was million at december  a cleanup period is either of the following periods if principal amounts under the term loan facility are outstanding x the day period following any day period in which the amount outstanding under the revolver facility exceeds million for each day  or y the one day period immediately following any required payment on any indebtedness subordinate to the facility 
the interest rate under the term loan facility is until february   when it increases to until the maturity date 
the interest rate under the revolver facility is equal to the prime rate plus per annum  provided that the minimum interest rate is per annum 
outstanding letters of credit are charged a letter of credit fee equal to per annum 
the facility contains covenants that limit our capital expenditures  except for capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business that do not exceed the amount approved by the majority lenders for fiscal year  or are financed out of the net cash proceeds of issuances of capital stock effected during a day period in excess of million or out of the net cash proceeds of asset sales  with an aggregate limit of million during the term of the loans outstanding under the facility the loans  i of up to million during the term of the loans  and ii that are paid for the acquisition of replacement assets either days before or days after the asset sale or recovery event 
for fiscal years and thereafter  our capital expenditures cannot exceed the amounts approved by the administrative agent and the majority lenders 
in addition  there are certain other financial covenants in the facility that we consider important in operating our business minimum consolidated ebitda  as of the last day of any fiscal quarter  for the period of two fiscal quarters that end on such day  of million  maximum leverage ratio as defined below as at the last day of any fiscal quarter of to  and minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined below  must be to at each fiscal quarter s end on a cumulative basis for the first eight fiscal quarters 
thereafter the ratio must be to at quarter s end for the total of the four preceding fiscal quarters 
leverage ratio is the ratio of a the principal amount of the loans plus the principal amount of all indebtedness that is equal to or senior in right of payment to the loans to b consolidated ebitda for the period of four quarters ending on such day 
consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio for any period  is the ratio of a the consolidated ebitda during such period plus  for each applicable test period ended on march  june  september  and december  of calendar years and  plus  to b the sum of i our capital expenditures during such period plus ii the cash income tax expense for such period plus iii our cash consolidated interest expense for such period to the extent paid or required to be paid during such period 
the facility contains additional covenants that limit our ability  among other things  to incur additional indebtedness or to create or incur liens  to merge  consolidate  liquidate  wind up or dissolve  to dispose of property  and to pay dividends on or redeem stock 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants in the facility 
at current oil and gas price levels  we expect to be in compliance with all of the credit facility covenants throughout declining commodity prices or rising expenses could prevent us from meeting the credit facility covenants 
in that event  we would attempt to negotiate an amendment or a waiver of the covenants from our lenders 
should the lenders fail to approve our requests  then we would attempt to obtain the funds to repay the outstanding credit facility debt through property sales or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in completing any of these possible actions 
liquidity and capital resources mission s principal sources of capital for the last three years have been cash flow from operations  debt sources such as the issuance of bonds or credit facility borrowings  issuances of common stock  and the sale of oil and gas properties 
our primary uses of capital have been the funding of the retirement of senior subordinated notes  exploration and development projects and property acquisitions 
at december   we had working capital of million compared to million at december  cash held for reinvestment in oil and gas properties of approximately million is included in the december  working capital amount 
approximately million of the proceeds from property sales were held for reinvestment at december  on january   we acquired the jalmat field for million  using these proceeds plus operating cash flow 
when this cash held for reinvestment is excluded  our working capital becomes negative 
the addition of a current obligation for asset retirement as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
and the unfavorable impact of increased commodity prices on our hedges fair value contributed most significantly to working capital reduction in the hedge liability represents the extent to which actual commodity prices exceed the price caps set by our hedges 
should commodity prices decrease  the liability will decline and the premium over the hedge prices that we will realize on unhedged production will also reduce 
since hedges are settled out of the receipts from the sale of production  we anticipate having adequate cash inflows to settle any hedge payments when they come due while maintaining revenue near the hedge price 
we believe that cash flows from operating activities combined with our ability to control the timing of substantially all of our future exploration and development requirements will provide us with the flexibility and liquidity to meet our planned capital requirements for our revolver facility is also available for short term borrowings 
source of capital operations cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million  million  and million for the fiscal years   and  respectively 
our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables  with prices of oil  natural gas and ngl being the most volatile 
prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions 
regional and worldwide economic growth  weather and other variable factors influence market conditions 
we are not able to control these factors and may not be able to accurately predict prices 
to mitigate some of the risk inherent in oil and natural gas prices  we hedge our oil and natural gas production by entering into commodity price swaps or collars designed to set minimum prices and maximum prices  or both  on a portion of our production 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a more detailed discussion of commodity price risk and a listing of our current hedges 
source of capital debt our outstanding balance under the senior subordinated notes was million at december  and was million at december  and in  we purchased and retired million of notes in two transactions for million in cash  from a million term loan facility established in march  and by exchanging million shares of common stock 
borrowings under our credit facilities were million in term loans at december  and million at the end of there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at december  additionally  we have million of credit available under the revolver facility as of december  as previously discussed under financing activities  both our notes and our credit facility contain covenants limiting our activities or requiring that we maintain specific financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
declining commodity prices or rising expenses could prevent us from meeting the credit facility covenants 
in that event  we would attempt to negotiate an amendment or a waiver of the covenants from our lenders 
should the lenders fail to approve our requests  then we would attempt to obtain the funds to repay the outstanding credit facility debt through property sales or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in completing any of these possible actions 
source of capital issuance of common stock we issued million shares of common stock on december  to ftvipt franklin income securities fund and franklin custodian funds income series in order to acquire million principal amount value of the senior subordinated notes 
these shares of common stock are currently registered for resale under an effective registration statement 
in february  we acquired million of our senior subordinated notes due for million shares of common stock in a transaction with stellar funding  ltd 
in addition  we have agreed to register the resale of these shares of common stock 
source of capital sale of properties we continue to evaluate and assess our property portfolio and capital needs  and we may from time to time sell certain properties as appropriate 
net proceeds from the sales of oil and gas properties were approximately million in  million in  and million in net proceeds are gross proceeds adjusted for transaction costs and interim operations 
we also sold our ecuadorian interests for approximately million in june and our interests in the snyder and diamond m gas plants for million in late use of capital exploration and development mission s expenditures for exploration  including land and seismic costs  and development of its domestic oil and gas properties totaled million  million  and million for the fiscal years   and  respectively 
we also spent million in the year on the development of fields in ecuador 
our capital budget for is million to million 
approximately of the total is planned for development projects  while is planned for exploration 
the remaining is planned for seismic data  land and land related assets and corporate assets 
based upon the level of funding needed for development  the level of exploratory spending could be modified to meet the budget in total 
this capital budget represents the largest planned use of our available operating cash flow 
we believe that cash flows from operating activities combined with our ability to control the timing of substantially all of our future exploration and development requirements will provide us with the flexibility and liquidity to meet our planned capital requirements for our intent is to apply less than our discretionary cash flow to capital projects in  therefore  the budget could be modified throughout the year to the extent that we can control the timing of capital expenditures 
use of capital acquisitions and other corporate assets in  spending for oil and gas property acquisitions was approximately million 
the most significant individual acquisition was that of an additional interest in high island block a for approximately  we did not make any significant oil and gas property acquisitions during the merger with bargo  valued at million  was our most significant acquisition of other domestic property acquisitions totaled million in the year we invested approximately million in other corporate assets during these assets include a new computer system for land records and office expansion to accommodate our growing workforce 
approximately million will be spent in for corporate assets 
we continuously review acquisition opportunities and would first consider utilizing operating cash flows to make a desired acquisition 
for larger acquisitions  our credit facility or the issuance of equity securities could provide the necessary funds  however  we cannot assure you that either of these sources would be able to provide funds adequate to complete every desired acquisition 
approximately million of the proceeds from property sales was held for reinvestment at december  the proceeds were used to fund the million acquisition of the jalmat field in the permian basin 
use of capital contractual obligations and commercial commitments mission is required to make future payments under contractual obligations 
the following table details those future payments amounts in thousands contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt      line of credit    operating leases  total contractual obligations      includes bond principal of million scheduled for repayment in and bond interest accrued monthly and payable april st and october st of each year 
mission has also made various commitments in the future should certain events occur or conditions exist 
the estimated payments related to those commitments are scheduled on the table below amounts in thousands commercial commitments total thereafter other commercial commitments   includes delay rentals required to hold undeveloped acres for future drilling 
critical accounting policies in response to sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we identified those policies of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and those policies that require our management to apply significant judgment 
we believe these critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas assets we use the full cost method of accounting for investments in oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method of accounting  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized as incurred into a full cost pool 
under the full cost method  a portion of employee related costs may be capitalized in the full cost pool if they are directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
generally  salaries and benefits are allocated based upon time spent on projects 
amounts capitalized can be significant when exploration and major development activities increase 
we deplete the capitalized costs in the full cost pool  plus estimated future expenditures to develop reserves  on a prospective basis using the units of production method based upon the ratio of current production to total proved reserves 
depreciation  depletion and amortization is a significant component of our net income 
proportionally  it represented of our total oil and gas revenues in the years ended december  and any reduction in proved reserves without a corresponding reduction in capitalized costs will increase the depletion rate 
if during  our reserves increase by  our depletion per mcfe would decrease approximately  or  however  a decrease in reserves will have a impact  increasing depletion per mcfe by approximately both the volume of proved reserves and the estimated future expenditures used for the depletion calculation are obtained from the reserve estimates prepared by independent reserve engineers 
these reserve estimates rely upon both the engineers quantitative and subjective analysis of various data  such as engineering data  production trends and forecasts  estimated future spending and the timing of spending 
finally  estimated production costs and commodity prices are added to the assessment in order to determine whether the estimated reserves have any value 
reserves that cannot be produced and sold at a profit are not included in the estimated total proved reserves  therefore the quantity of reserves can increase or decrease as oil and gas prices change 
see risk factors risks related to our business  industry and strategy for general cautions concerning the reliability of reserve and future net revenue estimates by reserve engineers 
the full cost method requires a quarterly calculation of a limitation on capitalized costs  often referred to as a full cost ceiling calculation 
the ceiling is the discounted present value of our estimated total proved reserves adjusted for taxes  using a discount rate 
to the extent that our capitalized costs net of depreciation  depletion  amortization  and deferred taxes exceed the ceiling  the excess must be written off to expense 
once incurred  this impairment of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase 
no such impairment was required in the years ended december  and while the difficulty in estimating proved reserves could cause the likelihood of a ceiling impairment to be difficult to predict  the impact of changes in oil and gas prices is most significant 
in general  the ceiling is lower when prices are lower 
oil and gas prices at the end of the period are applied to the estimated reserves  then costs are deducted to arrive at future net revenues  which are then discounted at to arrive at the discounted present value of proved reserves 
additionally  we adjust the estimated future revenues for the impact of our existing cash flow commodity hedges 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are generally held constant indefinitely 
therefore  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on mission s assessment of future prices or costs  but rather are based on prices and costs in effect as of the end the period 
because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the period be held constant  the resulting value is rarely indicative of the true fair value of our reserves 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been variable and  on any particular day at the end of a period  can be either substantially higher or lower than our long term price forecast  which we feel is more indicative of our reserve value 
you should not view full cost ceiling impairments caused by fluctuating prices  as opposed to reductions in reserve volumes  as an absolute indicator of a reduction in the ultimate value of our reserves 
oil and gas prices used in the ceiling calculation at december  were per barrel and per mmbtu 
a significant reduction in these prices at a future measurement date could trigger a full cost ceiling impairment 
as an illustration  had oil and gas prices at december  been lower  we would have been closer to a ceiling impairment 
our hedging program would serve to mitigate some of the impact of any price decline 
if our hedges were excluded from the ceiling calculation  we would have been closer to a ceiling impairment 
derivative instruments accounting all of our commodity derivative instruments represent hedges of the price of future oil and natural gas production 
we estimate the fair values of our hedges at the end of each reporting period 
the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities as appropriate 
for effective hedges  we record the change in the fair value of the hedge instruments to other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
any ineffectiveness in our hedges  which could represent either gains or losses  is reported when calculated as part of the interest and other income line of the statement of operations estimating the fair values of commodity hedge derivatives requires complex calculations  including the use of a discounted cash flow technique and our subjective judgment in selecting an appropriate discount rate 
in addition  the calculation uses future nymex prices  which although posted for trading purposes  are merely the market consensus of forecast price trends 
the results of our fair value calculation cannot be expected to represent exactly the fair value of our commodity hedges 
we currently use a software product from an outside vendor to calculate the fair value of our hedges 
this vendor provides the necessary nymex futures prices and the calculated volatility in those prices to us daily 
the software is programmed to apply a consistent discounted cash flow technique  using these variables and a discount rate derived from prevailing interest rates 
this software is successfully used by several of our peers 
its methods are in compliance with the requirements of sfas no 
and have been reviewed by a national accounting firm 
revenue recognition mission records revenues from sales of crude oil and natural gas when delivery to the customer has occurred and title has transferred 
this occurs when production has been delivered to a pipeline or a tanker lifting has occurred 
we may share ownership with other producers in certain properties 
in this case  we use the sales method to account for sales of production 
it is customary in the industry for various working interest partners to sell more or less than their entitled share of natural gas production  creating gas imbalances 
under the sales method  gas sales are recorded when revenue checks are received or are receivable on the accrual basis 
typically no provision is made on the balance sheet to account for potential amounts due to or from mission related to gas imbalances 
if the gas reserves attributable to a property have depleted to the point that there are insufficient reserves to satisfy existing imbalance positions  a liability or a receivable  as appropriate  should be recorded equal to the net value of the imbalance 
as of december   the company had recorded a net liability of approximately million  representing approximately  mcf at an average price of per mcf  related to imbalances on properties at or nearing depletion 
the net liability accrued as of december   was  for approximately  mcf at an average price of per mcf 
we value gas imbalances using the price at which the imbalance originated  if required by the gas balancing agreement  or we use the current price where there is no gas balancing agreement available 
reserve changes on any fields that have imbalances could change this liability 
we do not anticipate the settlement of gas imbalances to adversely impact our financial condition in the future 
settlements are typically negotiated  so the per mcf price for which imbalances are settled could differ among wells and even among owners in one well 
exclusive of the liability recorded for properties at or nearing depletion see discussion above  the company s unrecorded imbalance  valued at current prices would be a million liability 
asset retirement  impairment or disposal we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations effective january  previously our estimate of future plugging and abandonment and dismantlement costs was charged to income by being included in the capitalized costs that we depleted using the unit of production method 
sfas no 
requires us to record a liability for the fair value of our estimated asset retirement obligation  primarily comprised of our plugging and abandonment liabilities  in the period in which it is incurred 
upon initial implementation  we estimate asset retirement costs for all of our assets as of such date  inflation adjust those costs to the forecast abandonment date  discount that amount back to the date we acquired the asset and record an asset retirement liability in that amount with a corresponding addition to our asset value 
then we must compute all depletion previously taken on future plugging and abandonment costs  and reverse that depletion 
finally  we must accrete the liability to present day 
any income effect of this initial implementation is reflected as a change in accounting method on our statement of operations 
after initial implementation  we will reduce the liability as abandonment costs are incurred 
should actual costs incurred to abandon a field differ from the estimate  the difference will be reflected as an abandonment gain or loss in the statement of operations when the field is abandoned 
we will accrete the liability quarterly using the period and effective interest rates determined at implementation 
as new wells are drilled or purchased their initial asset retirement cost and liability will be calculated and recorded 
we have developed a process through which to track and monitor the obligations for each asset following implementation of sfas no 
when wells are sold the related liability and asset cost are removed from the balance sheet 
any difference between the two remains in the full cost pool 
sfas no 
does not specifically address the proper accounting to be applied by a full cost method company when properties are sold 
a may  letter to the fasb and the sec from a group of concerned companies makes inquiries and outlines possible alternatives  including our current treatment 
should a clarification be issued  there is a chance that mission s treatment will be required to change and the entire million credit that is in our full cost pool for would have to be included in income 
as with previously discussed estimates  the estimation of our initial liability and its subsequent remeasurements is dependent upon many variables 
we attempt to limit the impact of management s judgment on these variables by using the input of qualified third parties when possible 
we engaged an independent engineering firm to evaluate our properties annually and to provide us with estimates of abandonment costs 
we used the remaining estimated useful life from the yearend netherland  sewell associates  inc reserve report in estimating when abandonment could be expected for each property 
the resulting estimate  after application of a discount factor and some significant calculations  could differ from actual results  despite all our efforts to make the most accurate estimation possible 
should either the estimated life or the estimated abandonment costs of a property change upon subsequent review  a new calculation is performed using the same methodology of taking the abandonment cost and inflating it forward to its abandonment date and then discounting it back to the present using our risked rate 
the carrying value of the asset retirement obligation is adjusted to the newly calculated value  with a corresponding offsetting adjustment to the asset retirement cost 
income taxes mission has accumulated substantial income tax deductions that have not yet been used to reduce cash income taxes actually paid with the filing of our income tax returns 
these accumulated deductions are commonly referred to as net operating loss carryforwards or nols 
our nols are  subject to a number of restrictions  available to reduce cash taxes that may become owed in future years 
in accordance with the accounting for income taxes under sfas no 
 we record a deferred tax asset and a reduction of our tax expense for our nols 
if we estimate that some or all of our nol s are more likely than not going to expire or otherwise not be utilized to reduce future tax  we record a valuation allowance to remove the benefit of those nol s from our financial statements one of the restrictions on the future use of nols is contained in section of the internal revenue code 
in general  section provides that the amount of existing nols that may be used to offset future taxable income after the occurrence of an ownership change as defined solely for section purposes is limited to an amount that is determined  in part  by the fair market value of the enterprise at the time the ownership change occurred 
the fair market value of the enterprise s individual assets and the timing in which the value of those assets are realized are also factors that impact the amount of nols available under section limitation 
as a result of our issuance of common stock in exchange for the retirement of a portion of our senior subordinated notes in december  we experienced an ownership change as defined under section consequently  we have included the estimated impact that a limitation may have upon the future availability of our nols as part of our evaluation under sfas consistent with previously described estimates  the initial estimation of the future benefit of our nols is dependent upon many variables and is subject to change 
management s judgment on these variables is based upon the input of qualified third parties when possible 
we have used information derived from the public equity markets as well as data provided by an independent engineering firm to assist us with determining fair market values 
we have engaged an international independent public accounting firm to assist us in applying the numerous and complicated tax law requirements 
however  despite our attempt to make the most accurate estimates possible  the ultimate utilization of our nols is highly dependent upon our actual production and the realization of taxable income in future periods 
other matters dividends at present  there is no plan to pay dividends on our common stock 
certain restrictions contained in mission s outstanding notes and credit facility limit the amount of dividends that may be declared 
new accounting pronouncements sfas no

 liability recognition of certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
sfas no 
is effective for the exit and disposal activities initiated after december  we applied sfas no 
to the closings of our offices located in longview  texas and belleville  texas 
the fields served by these offices were sold during the fourth quarter of all activities required to close the offices and to establish one replacement office nearer to the company s remaining operated properties were concluded during an aggregate loss of approximately  was recognized in connection with these office closings  with almost  of the total related to severance payments made in accordance with mission s existing severance plan 
this loss is included in the interest and other income line of the statement of operations 
in november  fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and were not expected to materially effect our financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december  and can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements at footnote in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
 that provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
some of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and are included in the notes to consolidated financial statements at footnotes and fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of apb no 
 in january this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  significant changes to this interpretation were proposed by fasb in october  including delaying the effective date to the beginning of the first reporting period ending after december  mission does not currently own an interest in any variable interest entities  therefore  this interpretation does not have a material effect on its financial statements 
we will apply the provisions of this interpretation in the future should we acquire or establish a variable interest entity 
sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities summary was issued in april this statement amends and clarifies the accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including embedded derivatives  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
statement amends statement to reflect the decisions made as part of the derivatives implementation group dig and in other fasb projects or deliberations 
statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after june  mission has applied the pertinent dig interpretations as they were issued and does not expect sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity was issued in may sfas no 
provides guidance on how to classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
many of these instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the statement requires cumulative effect transition for financial instruments existing at adoption date 
none of our financial instruments were impacted by this statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk mission is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
to the extent that we use derivative instruments to mitigate these risks  we are also exposed to credit risk 
commodity price risk mission produces and sells crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
as a result  our operating results can be significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices caused by changing market forces 
we periodically seek to reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging a portion of production through swaps  options and other commodity derivative instruments 
a combination of options  structured as a collar  is our preferred hedge instrument because there are no up front costs and protection is given against low prices 
these collars assure that the nymex prices we receive on the hedged production will be no lower than the price floor and no higher than the price ceiling 
the oil hedges that are swaps fix the price to be received 
our realized price  excluding hedges  for natural gas per mcf is generally less than the nymex mmbtu price 
our realized price  excluding hedges  for oil is generally per bbl less than nymex 
realized prices differ from nymex due to factors such as the location of the property  the heating content of natural gas and the quality of oil 
the oil differential excludes the impact of point pedernales field production for which our selling price is capped at per bbl 
the point pedernales field was sold in march to the operator 
the gas differential stated above excludes the impact of the mist field gas production  which is sold at an annually fixed price 
in may several existing oil collars were cancelled 
new swaps and collars hedging forecast oil production were acquired 
we paid approximately million  the fair value of the previous oil price collars at that time  to counter parties in order to cancel the transactions 
by removing the price volatility from hedged volumes of oil and natural gas production  we have mitigated  but not eliminated  the potential negative effect of declining prices on our operating cash flow 
the potential for increased operating cash flow due to increasing prices has also been reduced 
if all our commodity hedges were to settle at december  prices  our cash flows would decrease by million  however the actual settlement of our hedges will increase or decrease cash flows over the period of the hedges at varying prices

  collar credit risk these commodity hedges expose mission to counter party credit risk to the extent the counter party is unable to meet its monthly settlement commitment to us 
we believe that we select creditworthy counter parties to our hedge transactions 
each of our counter parties have long term senior unsecured debt ratings of at least a a by standard poor s or moody s 
interest rate risk effective september   mission entered into an eight and one half year interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of million 
under the agreement  mission received a fixed interest rate and paid a floating interest rate  subject to a cap  based on the simple average of three foreign libor rates 
mission paid million to the counter party in february to cancel the swap 
a  gain related to the change in the fair market value of the swap from january  to the date of cancellation was recognized as a reduction in interest expense
