item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we operate primarily through three business segments the companion animal group cag  water testing business water and the food diagnostics group fdg 
cag comprises our veterinary diagnostic products and services rapid assays  instruments  instrument consumables and laboratory and consulting services  veterinary pharmaceuticals  and veterinary information products and services 
water develops  designs  manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in water 
fdg develops  designs  manufactures and distributes products to detect disease and contaminants in production animals and food 
other encompasses activities that are not included in our three business segments and is comprised primarily of corporate research and development  a ceo succession charge and interest income 
we have conformed the financial information about segments for the years ended december  and to our presentation of reportable segments for the year ended december  previously we reported two operating segments 

table of contents the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 
companion animal group our cag segment accounted for approximately of our sales in and is  therefore  our most significant business 
the largest product lines within our cag segment by percentage of revenue in are percentage of cag revenue instruments and consumables laboratory services rapid assays other other consists primarily of practice information management software and services and pharmaceutical products 
to date  revenues from sales of pharmaceutical products have not been substantial 
however  we are investing significantly in a pipeline of companion animal pharmaceutical products 
if we are successful in developing  obtaining fda approval for  and marketing these products  we believe that sales of pharmaceutical products will become a more material component of cag sales in the future 
by offering to companion animal veterinarians a broad range and an integrated set of proprietary diagnostic products and services  therapeutics and practice management computer systems  we believe we have developed a strong customer franchise  providing us a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings 
our complementary products and services give us scale in sales and distribution in this market  and permit us to offer programs such as practice developer  a loyalty program that allows clinics to earn points with purchases  depending on the number of product categories they purchase from and the volume of those purchases  and to apply earned points toward  among other things  the purchase of a variety of idexx products and services 
by offering both point of care diagnostics for use in the clinic and outside laboratory services  we are able to develop integrated disease management solutions that leverage the advantages of both point of care and laboratory testing 
in addition  by integrating our practice management software systems with our instruments and with our reference laboratories  we enhance the veterinary practices of our customers by facilitating the flow of medical information in the clinic 
in the us  we sell instrument consumables  rapid assays and pharmaceuticals through distributors  and therefore our reported sales of these products are sales made to distributors  rather than sales to veterinarians  the end users 
because distributor inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate  sales of a particular product line in a particular period may not always be representative of the underlying customer demand for the product 
therefore  we closely track sales of these products by our distributors to the clinics clinic level sales  which we think provides a more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products 
in the discussion of results below  we note certain instances where we believe reported sales have been influenced  positively or negatively  by changes in distributor inventories 
instruments and instrument consumables 
our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments called idexx vetlab that  individually and together  provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic  enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and build more profitable practices 
we derive substantial revenues from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments 
during the early stage of an instrument life cycle  we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements  while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placements begin to decline 
our long term success in this area of our business is dependent on our ability both to develop and sell new instruments with enhanced diagnostic capabilities and to maximize customer utilization of those instruments  which creates more consumables sales 
we have a large installed base of vettest chemistry analyzers  and substantially all of our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables sales  although we continue to place instruments through sales and through rental and other programs 
as a result  the success of this product line is partially dependent on 
table of contents increased customer utilization of those instruments 
toward that end  we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes 
we purchase the consumables used in vettest chemistry analyzers from ortho 
in october  we entered into a new supply agreement with ortho  under which we are developing and will introduce a next generation chemistry analyzer for the veterinary market based on the ortho dry slide technology  and ortho will supply us with the slide consumables used in both the new instrument and the vettest chemistry analyzer 
the new agreement provides us with a source of dry slide consumables through at an expected improved cost over the term of the agreement 
the new agreement does not increase  over the prior agreement  the minimum unit volume of slides we are required to purchase from ortho over the term of the agreement 
as a result of this new agreement  we discontinued certain internal development activities relating to an alternative next generation clinical chemistry instrument 
we incurred a non cash  pre tax charge in the quarter ended december  of approximately million for the impairment of manufacturing equipment purchased for the production of consumables for use in this alternative instrument 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced our new hematology analyzer  the lasercyte system  which provides more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our original platform  the qbc vetautoread system 
our success in growing hematology revenues over the next several years will depend upon our ability to sell lasercyte instruments  although we intend to continue to sell the qbc vetautoread system 
we do not intend to rent lasercyte instruments in the foreseeable future 
at earlier stages in the life cycle of this product  a substantial portion of lasercyte placements will be made at veterinary clinics that already own our qbc vetautoread instruments 
as a result  net consumables sales are not likely to grow significantly in the near future  as we expect the increase in lasercyte consumable sales to be largely offset by declines in sales of qbc vetautoread consumables 
however  we believe that the enhanced diagnostic capabilities of the lasercyte system will lead veterinarians to perform more in clinic hematology testing  which will increase consumables sales as our installed base of lasercyte systems increases 
in addition  we expect the gross margin percentage of lasercyte consumables to exceed the gross margin percentage of the qbc vetautoread consumables 
with all of our instrument lines  we seek to differentiate our products based on superior system capability  quality of diagnostic information  reliability and customer service 
our equipment and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings 
our success depends on our ability to maintain a premium price strategy 
in addition  our in clinic instrumentation competes with outside laboratory services for similar diagnostic information  and such services are typically offered at a lower cost 
therefore  our success also depends on our ability to market the relative attractiveness of in clinic diagnostic testing  versus less convenient and timely  but lower priced  laboratory testing 
laboratory services 
we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories 
we attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality  customer service and technology 
revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers 
in the third quarter of we acquired a laboratory in kentucky  in the fourth quarter of we opened a new laboratory in atlanta and in the first quarter of we acquired a laboratory in columbus  ohio 
profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements 
rapid assays 
our rapid assay business comprises single use kits for in clinic testing and microwell based kits for large clinic and laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions 
our two principal product lines are canine heartworm products and the snap fiv antibody felv antigen combination test 
our rapid assay strategy is to develop  manufacture  market and sell proprietary tests with superior performance that address important medical needs 
as in our other lines of business  we also seek to differentiate our products through superior customer support 
these products carry price premiums over competitive products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities  and which we believe do not include a similar level of support 
we augment our product development and customer service efforts with marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

table of contents water our strategy in the water testing business is to develop  manufacture  market and sell proprietary products with superior performance  supported by exceptional customer service 
our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important 
over the past several years the rate of growth of this product line has slowed as a result of increased competition and market penetration 
international sales of water testing products represented of total water product sales in  and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales 
growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line 
most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation  and in many countries a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body 
as a result  we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of countries  primarily in europe 
food diagnostics group production animal services 
we develop  manufacture  market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry  cattle and swine diseases and conditions  and have an active research and development and in licensing program in this area 
our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics 
disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable  and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated 
in response to outbreaks  testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods 
conversely  successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products 
the performance of this business  therefore  can be subject to fluctuation 
in  approximately of our sales in this business was international 
because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales  the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described below that are associated with doing business internationally 
dairy testing 
our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop  manufacture and sell antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of bulk milk by producers and provide reliable field performance 
sales of dairy testing products have declined over the last several years largely as a result of increased competition in the domestic market 
to increase sales of dairy testing products  we will need to increase penetration in geographies outside the united states and in the farm segment of the dairy market 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by our estimates of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
as of december   our inventories included million of component parts and finished goods associated with our lasercyte hematology instrument  which we began shipping to customers in fourth quarter of 
table of contents in addition  we have firm purchase commitments for an additional million 
we expect to fully realize our investment and purchase commitments 
however  if we alter the design of this product  we may be required to write off some or all of the associated inventory 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  failure to obtain regulatory approval of certain products  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant increase in the discount rate assumed to present value future cash flow  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant advancements or changes in technology 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based on a change in events and circumstances discussed above  we measure any impairment based on factors such as projected cash flows 
net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to million as of december   consisting of million related to veterinary laboratories of which million represents goodwill  million related to water test products of which million represents goodwill  million related to veterinary pharmaceutical products of which million represents goodwill and million of other of which million represents goodwill 
in  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and as a result  we ceased to amortize goodwill  but continued to amortize all other intangibles 
we had recorded approximately million of goodwill amortization on these amounts during the year ended december   and would have recorded approximately million of goodwill amortization during the same periods in and  if the existing standards had been continued 
in addition  we recorded million  million and million of other intangible amortization during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in lieu of goodwill amortization  we were required to perform annual impairment reviews of our goodwill 
no impairment was found as a result of either our initial impairment review or our and year end reviews 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when four criteria are met 
these include i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to distributors for substantially all products  as title and risk of loss pass to these customers on delivery to the common carrier 
we recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers when the product is delivered  except as noted below 
our distributors do not have the right to return products 
we recognize revenue on sales of instruments after the instrument is installed because installation is considered essential to the usability of the instrument  and the customer has accepted the instrument 
we recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed 
we recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contracts 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 

table of contents we recognize revenue from noncancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon installation of the software and completion of training if applicable or hardware and customer acceptance because collection is probable and we have no significant further obligations 
we recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of the rental agreement 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
when instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements  we allocate revenue to the extended maintenance agreement under eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accordingly the total consideration received is allocated to the elements based on their relative fair values  which is determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to other customers 
the deferred revenue related to the extended maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
the delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate under the policies described above 
shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue 
we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings  which may give customers future rights such as free or discounted goods or services or trade in rights 
we estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar customer programs in prior years 
revenue reductions are finalized on a quarterly basis for most programs upon issuance of credits or free or discounted products 
for the snap up the savings program  estimates of future customer credits are revised quarterly and finalized annually in the third quarter of each year upon the issuance of credits to customers 
for our practice developer volume discount program  we have reduced revenue assuming all points granted will result in future credits because we do not have sufficient experience with this program to estimate customer point forfeitures 
we recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is reasonably assured 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific client situations and percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances might be required 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable  respectively  and a deferred tax liability or asset  as the case may be  for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that relate to state and international net operating loss carryforwards and certain other unrealizable international deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we do not provide for us income taxes on earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us as of december   we had unremitted earnings in subsidiaries outside the us of million  on which no us taxes have been provided 
our intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when tax effective to do so 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable upon repatriation of foreign earnings 

table of contents warranty reserves we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our actual warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates  which are based on historical data and engineering estimates  where applicable  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
as of december  and  we had accrued million and million for estimated warranty expense  respectively 
warranty expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in warranty accrual and expense is due to our launch of the lasercyte system in the fourth quarter of we expect sales of lasercyte will continue to increase in and beyond 
we will charge warranty expense to the cost of lasercyte sales based upon our experience with instrument sales and engineering information about the system 
should actual warranty expense exceed our estimates  our cost of sales of lasercyte systems would increase 
estimates for certain claims we purchase insurance policies annually for individual and aggregate amounts of employee health insurance claims 
we are self insured for up to million per claim and up to an aggregate limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the plan per month  which is estimated to be million annually 
we estimate our liability for employee health claims based on individual and aggregate coverage  our monthly claims experience  the number of employees enrolled in the program  and the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is reported 
we purchase workers compensation insurance policies annually 
prior to january   we were fully insured for workers compensation claims 
beginning january   we purchased an insurance policy where we are liable for the first million in claims per occurrence and up to an aggregate limit based on payroll  which is estimated to be million for we renewed this policy effective january  we estimate our liability for workers compensation claims based on the insurance policy limits  claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to litigate and or settle the claims 
periodically we are notified that a claim is being made against us 
we evaluate each claim based on the facts and circumstances of each claim 
if warranted  we provide for our best estimate of the cost to settle or litigate the claim and evaluate the liability recorded quarterly

this increase resulted primarily from sales of instruments  rapid assay products  instrument consumables  laboratory services  pharmaceutical products  and veterinary practice management software and services 
the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of million  or  to the increase in cag revenue 
the increase in sales of instruments an increase of approximately million  or was due primarily to increased sales of the lasercyte hematology system  which was launched in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by lower sales of qbc vetautoread systems 
the increase in sales of rapid assay products an increase of approximately million  or was due to increased domestic clinic level sales of canine products and to a lesser degree  feline products  higher average unit prices  the impact of reductions in distributors inventory levels in and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us the increased sales volume was due in part to the apparent temporary difficulty of one of our competitors in supplying certain competitive products to the market 
in january this competitor announced that it had reentered the heartworm market 
in addition  another competitor announced that it has entered the heartworm market 
as a result  we believe that competition in the heartworm market will increase in the increase in sales of instrument consumables an increase of approximately million  or was due primarily to increased sales of vettest slides and  to a lesser extent  lasercyte tubes  partially offset by reduced sales of qbc vetautoread tubes resulting from the replacement of qbc vetautoread systems by lasercyte systems 
the overall increase in sales of instrument consumables was due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us  the impact of reductions in distributors inventory levels in  higher volume outside the us and increased domestic clinic level sales 
shipments to distributors of our consumables and rapid assay products during were significantly reduced by the company as part of a plan to reduce product inventories held by distributors

the increase in sales and marketing expenses resulted primarily from increased personnel and marketing program costs  increased costs to support the ramp up in lasercyte sales and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses 
the increase in other expense is primarily due to a million charge for the write down of production equipment purchased for the manufacture of consumables for use in an alternative clinical chemistry system 
in october we extended our relationship with ortho  which supplies the vettest slides 
we committed to develop a next generation clinical chemistry system based on ortho s dry slide technology and discontinued efforts to develop the alternative system

recent accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb reached consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 

eitf no 
addresses the accounting treatment for arrangements that provide for the delivery or performance of multiple products or services where the delivery of a product  system or performance of services may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
eitf no 
requires the separation of the multiple deliverables that meet certain requirements into individual units of accounting that are accounted for separately under the appropriate authoritative accounting literature 
eitf no 
is applicable to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company adopted the provisions of eitf no 
effective january the adoption of eitf no 
had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin 
fin requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee 
fin also requires additional disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligation under certain guarantees it has issued 
the accounting requirements for the initial recognition of guarantees are applicable on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for all guarantees outstanding  regardless of when they were issued or modified  for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december  we have adopted the additional disclosure provisions of this statement required for the year ended december  and the recognition provisions for the quarter ended march  there were no impacts of the adoption of this statement 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin r 
fin r provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities and on the determination of when such entities are required to be included in the consolidated financial statements of the business enterprise that holds an interest in the variable interest entity 
this new model for consolidation applies to 
table of contents an entity in which either the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin r requires additional related disclosures 
certain disclosure provisions of fin r apply to all financial statements issued after january   the consolidation provisions apply to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date  and the remaining provisions  with the exception of interest in special purpose entities  apply at the end of the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  application for interest in special purpose entities is required for periods after december  the adoption of fin r had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  sab no 
which replaces sab no 
this staff accounting bulletin revises or rescinds portions of the interpretative guidance included in topic of the codification of staff accounting bulletins in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the principal revisions relate to the rescission of material no longer necessary because of private sector developments in us generally accepted accounting principles 
this staff accounting bulletin also rescinds the revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers document issued in conjunction with topic selected portions of that document have been incorporated into topic sab no 
also rescinds the accounting guidance in sab no 
related to multiple element arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we fund the capital needs of our business through cash generated from operations

effective january   we entered into a workers compensation insurance policy where we retain the first million in claim liability per incident and up to specific limits  based on payroll  in claim liability in the aggregate 
we renewed this workers compensation policy effective january  we are liable for up to million in aggregate claim liability for and estimate that we will be liable for up to million for we have recorded our estimated claim liability as of december  based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims 
the insurance company administers and pays these claims and we reimburse the insurance company for our portion of these claims 
the insurance company also provides insurance for claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits 
we issued a million letter of credit to the insurance company as security for these claims as of december  and agreed to issue an additional million letter of credit for we purchased approximately million in fixed assets and million in other long term assets during the year ended december   principally related to the cag segment 
our total capital budget for is approximately million 
research and development expense as a percentage of revenue for is expected to be consistent with levels 
under certain supply agreements with suppliers of veterinary instruments  slides for our vettest instruments and certain raw materials  at december  we had aggregate commitments to purchase approximately million of products in cash provided by operating activities was million during cash of million was provided by an increase in accruals  defined as accrued expenses  accrued employee compensation and related expenses  accrued taxes and accrued marketing and customer programs  attributable primarily to increased liabilities for taxes  compensation and related liabilities and warranty expense 
cash of million was generated from the income tax benefit obtained due to the exercise of non qualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options 
cash of million was generated by an increase to accounts payable due primarily to the timing of quarterly shipments of vettest slides from ortho 
the non cash write down of manufacturing equipment 
table of contents reduced our net income by million and therefore is added back to cash generated from operations 
cash of million was used by an increase in accounts receivable due to high sales volume 
during and  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions 
in october  the board authorized the purchase of an additional  shares of common stock 
during  we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock for million 
as of december   and  approximately   and  cumulative shares  respectively  had been repurchased under these programs 
during  the company received approximately  shares of stock  which were owned by the holder for greater than six months  in payment for the exercise price of stock options 
the shares of stock had a fair market value of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are required to make the following payments in the years below in thousands total after minimum royalty payments operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations of this amount  million represents our minimum purchase obligation under our vettest slide supply agreement with ortho 
we believe that current cash  short term investments  long term investments  and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital purchase requirements 
future operating results the future operating results of idexx involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
idexx s future growth depends on several factors the future success of our business depends upon our ability to successfully implement various strategies  including developing  manufacturing and marketing new products with new features and capabilities  including pharmaceutical products and a new clinical chemistry instrument  and improving and enhancing existing products  including lasercyte  expanding our market by increasing use of our products by our customers  strengthening our sales and marketing activities both within the us and in geographies outside of the us  developing and implementing new technology development and licensing strategies  and identifying and completing acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business areas for us 
however  we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase or sustain our rate of growth 

table of contents idexx s markets are competitive and subject to rapid and substantial technological change we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services 
we expect that future competition will become even more intense  and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies 
some of our competitors and potential competitors  including large pharmaceutical companies  have substantially greater capital  manufacturing  marketing and research and development resources than we do 
idexx s products and services are subject to various government regulations in the us  the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the us department of agriculture usda  us food and drug administration fda and the us environmental protection agency epa 
most diagnostic tests for animal health applications  including our canine  feline  poultry and livestock tests  must be approved by the usda prior to sale 
our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they may be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa 
our pharmaceutical and dairy testing products require approval by the fda 
the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries 
any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the us or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products from the market  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have entered into an agreement with the fda under which we have agreed  among other things  to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our snap beta lactam dairy testing products and to provide related data to the fda 
if the fda were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability  the fda could take various actions  including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products 
sales of dairy antibiotic residue testing products were million in commercialization of animal health pharmaceuticals in the us requires prior approval by the fda 
to obtain such approvals we are required to submit substantial clinical  manufacturing and other data to the fda 
regulatory approval for products submitted to the fda may take several years and following approval  the fda continues to regulate all aspects of the manufacture  labeling  storage  record keeping and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
we have two animal pharmaceutical products in registration with the fda  including a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory for the treatment of lameness in horses and an injectible antibiotic for cats 
failure to obtain  or delays in obtaining  fda approval for these products would have a negative impact on our future growth 
changes in veterinary medical practices could negatively affect operating results we believe that more than half of all veterinary diagnostic testing occurs in laboratories 
although we have a significant laboratory business  our in clinic testing business is more material to our results of operations 
if testing by companion animal veterinarians generally were to shift towards increased laboratory testing and away from in clinic testing  this shift could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the market for diagnostic tests could be negatively impacted by the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services 
eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases 
such a decline could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
idexx s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technologies we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights 
if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights  our business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 
we cannot assure that we will obtain issued patents  that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid  or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies 
even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors  the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents in addition  expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights 
in the past  we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third party patents and we may receive such notices in the future 
patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict 
we cannot assure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case 
if we lose  we may be stopped from selling certain products and or we may be required to pay damages and or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit 
any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
idexx purchases materials for its products from a limited number of sources we currently purchase certain products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources 
some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary  and therefore may not be available from other sources 
these products include our vettest chemistry and qbc vetautoread hematology analyzers and related consumables  computed radiography systems  active ingredients for pharmaceutical products  including navigator  and certain components of our snap rapid assay devices  water testing products  and lasercyte systems 
if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future  then we could face cost increases or reductions or delays in product shipments  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the supplier of our computed radiography systems has informed us that it believes we are in breach of our supply agreement 
we believe we have complied fully with that agreement and we have filed suit against that supplier seeking declaratory judgment from the court that we are not in breach of the agreement  an order from the court compelling the supplier to honor our agreement and damages for certain breaches of the agreement by the supplier 
the supplier has asserted counter claims against us alleging  among other things  breaches of implied covenants in the contract 
we believe we have strong defenses to these counter claims and intend to contest them vigorously 
an adverse result in this litigation could result in loss of supply of our computed radiography instruments and or a requirement that we pay damages to the supplier 
revenue from this product line was million in the slides sold for use in our vettest instruments are purchased under an agreement with ortho at fixed prices 
under this agreement we are required to purchase a minimum of million of slides through to the extent that slides purchased under the contract exceed demand for the slides  we may incur losses in the future under this agreement 
to the extent that we are unable to maintain current pricing levels on sales of slides to our customers  our profits on slide sales would decline because we purchase slides at fixed prices 
idexx s biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture many of our products are biologics  which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms  such as antibodies  cells and sera 
manufacturing biologic products is highly complex 
unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy such as most pharmaceuticals  biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological materials 
difficulty in characterizing biological materials limits the precision of specifications for these materials  which creates greater risk in the manufacturing process 
we attempt to mitigate risk associated with the manufacture of biologics by utilizing multiple vendors  manufacturing some of these materials ourselves and maintaining substantial inventories of materials that have demonstrated the appropriate characteristics 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria 
our inability to obtain necessary biological materials or to manufacture successfully biologic products that incorporate such materials would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
idexx s sales are dependent on distributor purchasing patterns we sell many of our products  including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us  through distributors 
because significant product sales are made to a limited number of customers  unanticipated changes in the timing and size of distributor purchases can have a negative effect on quarterly results 

table of contents our financial performance  therefore  is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable 
inventories of pharmaceutical products under development may not be usable while our pharmaceutical products are under development  we may carry related active ingredients  other raw materials and finished goods as assets on our balance sheet when recovery of the asset value from future sales is deemed probable 
to the extent that these inventories become unusable due to unanticipated delays in obtaining fda approval for these products  or to our failure to obtain such approvals  we may be required to write down those inventories  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
international revenue accounts for a significant portion of idexx s total revenue various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales 
possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  disruptions in transportation of our products  the differing product and service needs of foreign customers  difficulties in building and managing foreign operations  import export duties and quotas  and unexpected regulatory  economic or political changes in foreign markets 
prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive  market or other factors 
as a result  the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we operate subsidiaries in foreign countries and transact business in local currencies 
we attempt to hedge the majority of our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure 
see note m to our consolidated financial statements 
the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions 
corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity 
we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with a duration of less than months 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency from commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred in prepaid expenses or accruals and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction 
our hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods 
our hedging strategy provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year  which is complete by the end of the preceding year 
quarterly  we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the following twelve months 
accordingly  our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 
as of december   the company had million in unrealized losses on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income  which is net of million in taxes 
our currency rate exposure at december  consisted of local currency revenues and expenses  the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the company s or its subsidiaries functional currency 
based on our overall currency rate exposure excluding unrealized losses of million at december  and million at december   a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would reduce operating income by approximately million for a strengthening of the us dollar from december  would have reduced operating income for by approximately million 
a weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies at december  would increase operating income by approximately million in a weakening of the us dollar from december  would have increased operating income by approximately million in as of december  a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place  would reduce operating income by approximately million in  compared to million in and the effects of a weakening of us dollar relative to foreign currencies  excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place  would increase operating income by approximately million in compared to million in
