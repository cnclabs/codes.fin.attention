of the total remaining home sites available   were under construction or completed including models and sales offices   were under option  and were financed through purchase money mortgages 
the following table summarizes our total started or completed unsold homes as of october  unsold homes models total northeast region southeast region southwest region west region total backlog at october  and october   we had a backlog of signed contracts for  homes and  homes  respectively  with sales values aggregating  million and  million  respectively 
substantially all of our backlog at october  is expected to be completed and closed within the next twelve months 
at november  and  our backlog of signed contracts was  homes and  homes  respectively  with sales values aggregating  million and  million  respectively 
sales of our homes typically are made pursuant to a standard sales contract that provides the customer with a statutorily mandated right of rescission for a period ranging up to days after execution 
this contract requires a nominal customer deposit at the time of signing 
in addition  in the northeast region and the southeast region we typically obtain an additional to down payment due to days after signing 
the contract may include a financing contingency  which permits the customer to cancel his obligation in the event mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates including financing arranged or provided by us is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract 
this contingency period typically is four to eight weeks following the date of execution 
residential land inventory it is our objective to control a supply of land  primarily through options  consistent with anticipated homebuilding requirements in each of our housing markets 
controlled land as of october   exclusive of communities under development described under business and properties residential development activities  is summarized in the following table 
the proposed developable lots in communities under development are included in the  total home lots under the total residential real estate chart in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in thousands number of proposed communities proposed developable lots total land option price book value northeast region under option owned total southeast region under option owned total southwest region under option owned total west region under option owned total totals under option owned combined total properties under option also include costs incurred on properties not under option but which are under evaluation 
for properties under option  as of october   option fees and deposits aggregated approximately million 
as of october   we spent an additional million in non refundable predevelopment costs on such properties 
the book value of million is identified on the balance sheet as inventories land  land options  held for future development or sale  and does not include inventory in poland amounting to million for communities partially under construction 
the book value does include option deposits of million for specific performance options  million for other option deposits  and million for variable interest entity deposits reported under consolidated inventory not owned 
in our northeast region  our objective is to control a supply of land sufficient to meet anticipated building requirements for at least four years 
we typically option parcels of unimproved land for development 
in our southeast region  a portion of the land we acquired was from land developers on a lot takedown basis 
in our southwest region  we primarily acquire improved lots from land developers 
under a typical agreement with the lot developer  we purchase a minimal number of lots 
the balance of the lots to be purchased is covered under an option agreement or a non recourse purchase agreement 
due to the dwindling supply of improved lots in these markets  we are currently optioning parcels of unimproved land for development 
in our west region  where possible  we plan to option developed or partially developed lots 
with a limited supply of developed lots in the west  we are also optioning parcels of unimproved land for development 
customer financing at our communities  on site personnel facilitate sales by offering to arrange financing for prospective customers through our mortgage subsidiaries 
we believe that the ability to offer financing to customers on competitive terms as a part of the sales process is an important factor in completing sales 
our business consists of providing our customers with competitive financing and coordinating and expediting the loan origination transaction through the steps of loan application  loan approval and closing 
we originate loans in new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  maryland  virginia  north carolina  texas  ohio  and california 
during the year ended october   approximately of our homebuyers paid in cash and over of our non cash homebuyers obtained mortgages originated by one of our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiaries or our mortgage joint venture in our northeast region and west region 
we customarily sell virtually all of the loans and loan servicing rights that we originate 
loans are sold either individually or in pools to gnma  fnma  or fhlmc or against forward commitments to institutional investors  including banks  mortgage banking firms  and savings and loan associations 
competition our residential business is highly competitive 
we are among the top ten homebuilders in the united states in both homebuilding revenues and home deliveries 
we compete with numerous real estate developers in each of the geographic areas in which we operate 
our competition range from small local builders to larger regional and national builders and developers  some of which have greater sales and financial resources than us 
previously owned homes and the availability of rental housing provide additional competition 
we compete primarily on the basis of reputation  price  location  design  quality  service and amenities 
regulation and environmental matters general 
we are subject to various local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  building design  construction and similar matters  including local regulations which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular locality 
in addition  we are subject to registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction  advertisement and sale of our communities in certain states and localities in which we operate even if all necessary government approvals have been obtained 
we may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums that could be implemented in the future in the states in which we operate 
generally  such moratoriums relate to insufficient water or sewerage facilities or inadequate road capacity 
environmental 
we are also subject to a variety of local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment environmental laws 
the particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site  the site s environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site 
these environmental laws may result in delays  may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs  and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas 
conclusion 
despite our past ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals for our communities  we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future 
although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements  they could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs and substantial expenditures for pollution and water quality control  which could have a material adverse effect our profitability 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as changes in policies  rules and regulations and their interpretation and application 
company offices we own a  square foot office complex located in the northeast region that serves as our corporate headquarters 
we also own  square feet of office and warehouse space throughout our northeast region and  square feet of office space in our southeast region 
we lease approximately  square feet of space for our other operating divisions located in our northeast region  southeast region  southwest region and west region 
item legal proceedings we are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business  none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on us 
over the past several years  general liability insurance for homebuilding companies and their suppliers and subcontractors has become very difficult to obtain 
the availability of general liability insurance has been limited due to a decreased number of insurance companies willing to write for the industry 
in addition  those few insurers willing to write liability insurance have significantly increased the premium costs 
the company has been able to obtain general liability insurance but at higher premium costs with higher deductibles 
the company has been advised that a significant number of its subcontractors and suppliers have also had difficulty obtaining insurance that also provides coverage to the company 
while no assurance can be given  the company believes that it will be able to continue to obtain coverage but at higher total costs

business combinations sfas 
under sfas for acquisitions subsequent to june  and accounting principles board apb opinion for acquisitions prior to june  we record as our cost the estimated fair value of the acquired assets less liabilities assumed 
any difference between the cost of an acquired company and the sum of the fair values of tangible assets less liabilities is recorded as goodwill  indefinite or definite life intangibles 
the reported income of an acquired company includes the operations of the acquired company from the date of acquisition 
income recognition from home and land sales income from home and land sales are recorded when title is conveyed to the buyer  adequate cash payment has been received and there is no continued involvement 
income recognition from mortgage loans profits and losses relating to the sale of mortgage loans are recognized when legal control passes to the buyer and the sales price is collected 
inventories for inventories of communities under development  a loss is recorded when events and circumstances indicate impairment and the undiscounted future cash flows generated are less than the related carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is based on discounted future cash flows generated from expected revenue  cost to complete including interest  and selling costs 
inventories and long lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less selling costs 
fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
construction costs are accumulated during the period of construction and charged to cost of sales under specific identification methods 
land  land development  and common facility costs are allocated based on buildable acres to product types within each community  then charged to cost of sales equally based upon the number of homes to be constructed in each product type 
insurance deductible reserves our deductible is  per occurrence for worker s compensation and general liability insurance 
reserves have been established based upon actuarial analysis of estimated future losses during and interest costs related to properties under development are capitalized during the land development and home construction period and expensed along with the associated cost of sales as the related inventories are sold 
costs related to properties not under development are charged to interest expense 
land options costs are capitalized when incurred and either included as part of the purchase price when the land is acquired or charged to operations when we determine we will not exercise the option

intangible assets the intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet are goodwill  tradenames  architectural designs  distribution processes  and contractual agreements with both definite and indefinite lives resulting from company acquisitions 
we no longer amortize goodwill or indefinite life intangibles  but instead assess them periodically for impairment 
we performed such assessments utilizing a fair value approach as of october  and  and determined that no impairment of intangibles existed 
we are amortizing the definite life intangibles over their expected useful life  ranging from three to seven years 
post development completion costs in those instances where a development is substantially completed and sold and we have additional construction work to be incurred  an estimated liability is provided to cover the cost of such work and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
capital resources and liquidity our operations consist primarily of residential housing development and sales in our northeast region new jersey  southern new york state  pennsylvania  and ohio  our southeast region washington dc  maryland  virginia  west virginia  north carolina  south carolina  and florida  our southwest region texas and arizona  and our west region california 
during the year ended october   we substantially liquidated our operations in the mid south 
in addition  we provide financial services to our homebuilding customers 
our cash uses during the twelve months ended october  were for operating expenses  increases in housing inventories  construction  income taxes  interest  the repurchase of common stock  the purchase of senior notes  the paydown of our revolving credit facility  and the acquisition of four homebuilders 
we provided for our cash requirements from housing and land sales  the revolving credit facility  the issuance of million senior subordinated notes  financial service revenues  and other revenues 
we believe that these sources of cash are sufficient to finance our working capital requirements and other needs 
at october   there was no cash balance outstanding under our million revolving credit facility and we had approximately million of cash 
at october   we had issued million of letters of credit which reduces cash available under our revolving credit facility 
cash requirements for fiscal are projected to increase as we continue to open new communities and fund organic growth 
we anticipate moderate usage under the existing revolving credit facility to replenish inventory associated with the construction of new homes 
on november   we issued senior notes which generated proceeds of approximately million 
the purpose of this issuance was to fund existing operations and to ensure that we maintain ample liquidity to fund future growth 
our net income historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities 
the difference between net income and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in receivables  prepaid and other assets  interest and other accrued liabilities  accounts payable  inventory levels  mortgage loans and liabilities  and non cash charges relating to depreciation  the writeoff of computer software costs  and impairment losses 
in  a portion of the difference was also due to goodwill amortization 
when we are expanding our operations  which was the case in fiscal and  inventory levels  receivables  prepaids and other assets increase causing cash flow from operating activities to decrease 
liabilities also increase as operations expand 
the increase in liabilities partially offsets the negative effect on cash flow from operations caused by the increase in inventory levels  receivables  prepaids and other assets 
as our mortgage warehouse loan asset increases  cash flow from financing operations decrease 
conversely  as such warehouse loan assets decrease  cash flow from financing operations increase 
depreciation  intangible amortization and impairment losses always increase cash flow from operating activities since they are non cash charges to operations 
on july   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of class a common stock 
as of october    shares have been purchased under this program  of which  and  were repurchased during the twelve months ended october  and  respectively 
in addition  in  we retired million shares that were held by a seller of a previous acquisition 
our homebuilding bank borrowings are made pursuant to an amended and restated revolving credit agreement the agreement that provides a revolving credit line and letter of credit line of million through july interest is payable monthly and at various rates of either the prime rate plus or libor plus 
in addition  we pay a fee equal to per annum on the weighted average unused portion of the line 
we believe that we will be able either to extend the agreement beyond july or negotiate a replacement facility  but there can be no assurance of such extension or replacement facility 
we currently are in compliance and intend to maintain compliance with the covenants under the agreement 
each of our significant subsidiaries  except for our financial services subsidiaries and joint ventures  is a guarantor under the revolving credit agreement 
as of october   there were no borrowings under the agreement 
at october  we had million of outstanding senior debt million  net of discount  comprised of million senior notes due  million senior notes due  and million senior notes due at october   we had million outstanding senior subordinated debt comprised of million senior subordinated notes due  and million senior subordinated notes due each of our significant subsidiaries except for our financial services subsidiaries and joint ventures are a guarantor under the senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
on january  we executed a million five year term loan 
the term loan matures january   and bears interest at either the prime rate plus or libor plus 
each of our significant subsidiaries except for our financial services subsidiaries and joint ventures is a guarantor under the term loan 
at october   borrowings under the term loan were million 
our mortgage banking subsidiary s warehousing agreement was amended and restated on july  pursuant to the agreement  we may borrow up to million 
the agreement expires in july and interest is payable monthly at the federal funds rate plus 
we believe that we will be able either to extend this agreement beyond july or negotiate a replacement facility  but there can be no assurance of such extension or replacement facility 
as of october   the aggregate principal amount of all borrowings under this agreement was million 
total inventory increased million during the twelve months ended october  this increase excluded the change in consolidated inventory not owned of million consisting of specific performance options  options with variable interest entities  and other options that were added to our balance sheet in accordance with sfas  sfas  and eitf  and variable interest entities in accordance with fin see the recent accounting pronouncements section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional explanation on fin excluding the impact from acquisitions of million  total inventory in our northeast region increased million  the southeast region increased million and our west region increased million 
the increase in our existing regions was primarily the result of planned future organic growth 
these increases were slightly offset by a million decrease in our southwest region due to fewer active selling communities 
substantially all homes under construction or completed and included in inventory at october  are expected to be closed during the next twelve months 
most inventory completed or under development is financed through our line of credit  term loan  and senior subordinated indebtedness 
we usually option property for development prior to acquisition 
by optioning property  we are only subject to the loss of the cost of the option and predevelopment costs if we choose not to exercise the option 
as a result  our commitment for major land acquisitions is reduced

we have entered into a few joint ventures with independent third parties to develop and sell land or to develop land to build and sell homes 
at october  we have invested million in joint ventures 
we have no guarantees associated with these unconsolidated joint ventures 
prepaid project costs consist of community specific expenditures that are used over the life of the community 
such prepaids are expensed as homes are delivered 
at october   we have million of prepaid project costs 
prepaid expenses and other assets also include debt issuance fees  prepaid insurance  non qualified associate benefit plan assets and miscellaneous prepaids and assets 
intangibles increased million to million at october  million are categorized as goodwill and indefinite life intangibles 
this amount resulted from company acquisitions prior to fiscal million are categorized as definite life intangibles resulting from acquisitions made in fiscal to the extent the acquisition price was greater than the book value of tangible assets which were stepped up to fair values  purchase price premiums are classified as intangibles 
professionals were hired to appraise all acquired intangibles 
such appraisals resulted in all fiscal acquisition premiums to be categorized as definite life intangibles 
see the critical accounting policies section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional explanation of intangibles 
for tax purposes all our intangibles  except those resulting from an acquisition classified as a tax free exchange  are being amortized over years 
financial services mortgage loans held for sale consist of residential mortgages receivable of which million and million at october  and october   respectively  are being temporarily warehoused and awaiting sale in the secondary mortgage market 
the balance of mortgage loans held for sale are being held as an investment 
we may incur risk with respect to mortgages that become delinquent  but only to the extent the losses are not covered by mortgage insurance or resale value of the house 
historically  we have incurred minimal credit losses 
accounts payable and other liabilities increased million to million at october  accounts payable and other liabilities consist primarily of accounts payable  accrued expenses  accrued compensation and reserves  which amounted to million  million  million  and million  respectively  at october  the majority of the reserves consist of a warranty accrual for repair costs to homes over  for community amenities and land development infrastructure 
we accrue for warranty costs at the time each home is closed and title and possession have been transferred to the homebuyer as part of cost of sales 
in addition  we accrue for warranty costs under our  per occurrence general liability insurance deductibles as part of selling  general  and administration 
warranty accruals are based upon historical experience

october  includes deliveries from our california acquisition beginning on january  october  includes deliveries from our southeast region acquisition beginning on january  other includes operations from markets we have exited in recent years 
the increase in housing revenues during the year ended october  was primarily due to organic growth within our existing operations 
excluding acquisitions  housing revenues and average sales prices increased in all four of our regions combined by and  respectively 
deliveries increased in all regions  combined after excluding deliveries for fiscal acquisitions 
we realized increases in all regions except the southeast 
the decline in deliveries in the southeast was due to delayed community openings because of severe weather conditions during the early part of fiscal unaudited quarterly housing revenues and net sales contracts by market area using base sales prices for the years ending october    and are set forth below quarter ended in thousands october july april january housing revenues northeast region southeast region southwest region west region other total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast region southeast region southwest region west region other total quarter ended in thousands october july april january housing revenues northeast region southeast region southwest region west region other total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast region southeast region southwest region west region other total quarter ended in thousands october july april january housing revenues northeast region southeast region southwest region west region other total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast region southeast region southwest region west region other total an important indicator of our future results are recently signed contracts and our home contract backlog for future deliveries

as a result  depending on the mix of both the communities and of home types delivered  consolidated gross margin will fluctuate up or down 
we achieved higher gross margins during the year ended october  compared to the same period last year 
the consolidated gross margin increased during the year ended october  this increased margin is primarily the result of higher sales prices 
during the year ended october  our margins increased in all of our regions  except in the southwest region where they remained flat 
during the year ended october   our gross margin percentage increased from the previous year 
this increase was due to higher sales prices and lower costs resulting from our improvement initiatives 
gross margins for the year ended october  increased in our southeast region  west region excluding our california acquisition in fiscal  and the northeast region 
in the southwest  gross margins declined very slightly in fiscal the dollar increases in gross margin for each of the three years ended october    and were attributed to increased sales  resulting from our acquisitions and increased deliveries in previously existing markets 
homebuilding selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues have averaged approximately for the years ended october    and such expenses increased to million for the year ended october  and increased to million for the year ended october  from million for the previous year 
the increased spending year over year was primarily due to our acquisitions and increased deliveries in previously existing markets 
we have written off or written down certain inventories totaling   and million during the years ended october    and  respectively  to their estimated fair value 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional explanation 
these write offs and write downs were incurred primarily because of the decision not to exercise certain options to purchase land  redesign of communities in planning  a change in the marketing strategy to liquidate a particular property or lower property values 
during the years ended october    and  we wrote off residential land options and approval and engineering costs amounting to   and million  respectively  which are included in the total write offs mentioned above 
when a community is redesigned  abandonded engineering costs are written off 
option and approval and engineering costs are written off when a community s proforma profitability does not produce adequate returns on the investment commensurate with the risk and we cancel the option 
such write offs were located in our northeast region  southeast region  west region  and poland 
during the year ended october  we wrote down one community million in our southwest region 
this property was acquired as part of one of our acquisitions 
a decision was made to liquidate this property resulting in lower sales prices 
the write downs of residential inventory during the year ended october  were attributed to poland and the mid south 
the write down in poland was based upon changes in market conditions 
in the mid south  land was written down based on a purchase offer 
we have made a decision to discontinue selling homes in these two markets and offer the remaining lots for sale 
the result of the above decisions was a reduction in inventory carrying amounts to fair value  resulting in a million impairment loss 
during the year ended october   we wrote down two residential communities in the northeast region  and three in the southeast region 
the write down in the northeast region was attributed to two communities that were part of a large land acquisition  which resulted in a loss 
the write downs in the southeast region were based upon changes in market conditions 
the result of the above decisions was a reduction in inventory carrying amounts to fair value  resulting in a million impairment loss 
land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues consist primarily of land and lot sales 
a breakout of land and lot sales is set forth below year ended in thousands october october october land and lot sales cost of sales land and lot sales gross margin land and lot sales are incidental to our residential housing operations and are expected to continue in the future but may significantly fluctuate up or down 
financial services financial services consists primarily of originating mortgages from our homebuyers  selling such mortgages in the secondary market  and title insurance activities 
during the years ended october   october   and october   financial services provided a   and million pretax profit  respectively 
the increases in   and were primarily due to a change in management  reduced costs  increased mortgage loan amounts  and the addition of mortgage operations from our acquisitions 
in addition to our wholly owned mortgage subsidiaries  customers obtained mortgages from our mortgage joint ventures in our northeast region ohio in  our west region in  and our southwest region in in the market areas served by our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiaries  approximately   and of our non cash homebuyers obtained mortgages originated by these subsidiaries during the years ended october    and  respectively 
servicing rights on new mortgages originated by us will be sold as the loans are closed 
corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses include the operations at our headquarters in red bank  new jersey 
such expenses include our executive offices  information services  human resources  corporate accounting  training  treasury  process redesign  internal audit  construction services  and administration of insurance  quality  and safety 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses were for the years ended october  and  respectively  and for the year ended october  the percentage decrease from the year ended october  was due to increased housing revenues 
increases in corporate general and administrative dollar expenses are primarily attributed to higher employee incentives due to higher returns on equity 
interest interest expense includes housing  and land and lot interest 
interest expense is broken down as follows year ended in thousands october october october sale of homes land and lot sales total housing interest as a percentage of sale of home revenues amounted to   and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
these percentage decreases are primarily attributed to a decrease in debt leverage of our company due to growth in equity from earnings and lower interest rates 
other operations other operations consist primarily of miscellaneous residential housing operations expenses  senior residential property operations  amortization of senior and senior subordinated note issuance expenses  earnout payments from homebuilding company acquisitions  amortization of the consultant s agreement and the right of first refusal agreement from our california acquisition in fiscal  minority interest relating to joint ventures  corporate owned life insurance  expenses associated with the early extinguishment of debt  and certain contributions 
also reported in other operations are restructuring charges associated with our southeast region merger in fiscal and expenses associated with exiting our mid south market as well as the write off of costs associated with sap in fiscal  our enterprise wide operating software 
we were not successful in implementing sap  due to the complexities and limitations in the software program 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply to product warranties 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

the new standard provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the affect of the method used on reported results 
we have not elected to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no

fin is effective immediately for vie s created after january  pursuant to fasb revision to fin fsp  a public entity need not apply the provisions of fin to an interest held in a variable interest entity or potential variable interest entity until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after march   if the vie was created before february   and the public entity has not issued financial statements reporting that vie in accordance with fin we have elected to defer the application of fin to our interests in potential variable interest entities created prior to february  pursuant to fsp based on the provisions of fin  we have concluded that whenever we option land or lots from an entity and pay a non refundable deposit  a vie is created under condition ii b and c of the previous paragraph 
we have been deemed to have provided subordinated financial support  which refers to variable interests that will absorb some or all of an entity s expected theoretical losses if they occur 
for each vie created with a significant nonrefundable option fee  we will compute expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as outlined in fin if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie we will consolidate it on our balance sheet 
the fair value of the vie s inventory will be reported as consolidated inventory not owned variable interest entities 
management believes fin was not clearly thought out for application in the homebuilding industry for land and lot options 
under fin  we can have an option and put down a small deposit as a percentage of the purchase price and still have to consolidate the entity 
our exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with the vie is only the deposit  not it s total assets consolidated on the balance sheet 
in certain cases we will have to place inventory on our balance sheet the vie has optioned to other developers 
in addition  if the vie has creditors  it s debt will be placed on our balance sheet even though the creditors have no recourse against our company 
based on these observations we believe consolidating vie s based on land and lot option deposits does not reflect the economic realities or risks of owning and developing land 
at october   we consolidated vie s created from february  to october  as a result of our options to purchase land or lots from the selling entities 
we paid cash or issued letters of credit deposits to these eleven vie s totaling million 
our option deposits represent our maximum exposure to loss 
the fair value of the property owned by the vie s was million of which million was not optioned to our company 
because we could not get the remainder of the selling entities to provide us with any financial information  the fair value of the optioned property less our cash deposits and liabilities from inventory not owned  which totaled million  was reported on the balance sheet as minority interest from inventory not owned 
creditors of these vie s have no recourse against our company 
we will continue to secure land and lots using options 
including the deposits with the eleven vie s above  at october  we have total cash and letters of credit deposits amounting to approximately million to purchase land and lots with a total purchase price of billion 
not all our deposits are with vie s 
the maximum exposure to loss is limited to the deposits although some deposits are refundable at our request or refundable if certain conditions are not met 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities that fall within the scope of sfas no 
 account ing for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas also amends certain other existing pronouncements  which will result in more consistent reporting of contracts that are derivatives in their entirety or that contain embedded derivatives that warrant separate accounting 
sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  it is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
total taxes total taxes as a percentage of income before taxes amounted to approximately   and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
the decrease in this percentage from to is primarily attributed to state tax reduction initiatives adopted during fiscal in addition  as our pretax profits increase  permanent tax differences that remain relatively constant in dollars have less impact on increasing the effective federal income tax rate 
deferred federal and state income tax assets primarily represent the deferred tax benefits arising from temporary differences between book and tax income which will be recognized in future years as an offset against future taxable income 
if for some reason the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years to recover the deferred tax assets 
as a result  management is confident such deferred tax assets reflected in the balance sheet are recoverable regardless of future income 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for an additional explanation of taxes 
inflation inflation has a long term effect on us because increasing costs of land  materials  and labor result in increasing sale prices of our homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in our housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of our homes 
a significant risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising house costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
in recent years  in the price ranges in which our homes sell  we have not found this risk to be a significant problem 
inflation has a lesser short term effect on us because we generally negotiate fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of our homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between four to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of our homebuilding cost of sales 
mergers and acquisitions on january   we acquired a california homebuilder for a total purchase price of million  of which million was paid in cash and  shares of our class a common stock were issued 
at the date of acquisition we also paid off approximately million of their third party debt 
during the second quarter ended april   we exercised the right to retire at no cost  class a common stock shares that were held by the selling principal under the terms of the acquisition 
on november   and december  we acquired two texas homebuilding companies 
on april   we acquired a build on your own lot homebuilder in ohio  and on august   we acquired a homebuilder in arizona 
our aggregate net cash purchase price  including payment of third party debt  for fiscal year acquisitions was approximately million 
all acquisitions provide for other payments to be made  generally dependant upon achievement of certain future operating and return objectives

certain risks  uncertainties  and other factors are described in detail in item and business and properties in this form k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk facing us is interest rate risk on our long term debt 
in connection with our mortgage operations  mortgage loans held for sale and the associated mortgage warehouse line of credit are subject to interest rate risk  however  such obligations reprice frequently and are short term in duration 
in addition  we hedge the interest rate risk on mortgage loans by obtaining forward commitments from private investors 
accordingly the risk from mortgage loans is not material 
we do not hedge interest rate risk other than on mortgage loans using financial instruments 
we are also subject to foreign currency risk but this risk is not material 
the following tables set forth as of october  and  our long term debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value fmv 
there have been no significant changes in our market risk from october  to october  for the year ended october  dollars in thousands thereafter total fmv at long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate for the year ended october  dollars in thousands thereafter total fmv at long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate does not include bonds collateralized by mortgages receivable 
libor plus 
in addition  the company has reassessed the market risk for its variable debt  which is based upon libor  and believes that a one percent increase in the libor rate would have an approximate million annual increase in interest expense based on million of variable rate debt outstanding at october  and  respectively
