item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information about the effect of geographic concentration and the alaska economy on us 
factors that may affect our business and future results additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations 
any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
risks relating to our business and operations we face competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
there is substantial competition in the communications industry 
the traditional dividing lines between long distance telephone  local telephone  wireless telephone  internet  and video services are increasingly becoming blurred 
through mergers and various service integration and product bundling strategies  major providers are striving to provide integrated communications services offerings within and across geographic markets 
we expect competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies  products and services 
we cannot predict which of many possible future technologies  products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies  products or services 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on marketing and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including new services that may be introduced  changes in consumer preferences  economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors 
to the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in our industry and in our markets  we could lose market share or experience a decline in our revenue and net income 
competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services 
competitive pressures also create challenges for our ability to grow new businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute our business plan 
each of our business segments also faces the risk of potential price cuts by our competitors that could materially adversely affect our market share and gross margins 
long distance services 
the long distance industry is intensely competitive and subject to constant technological change 
competition is based upon price and pricing plans  the type of services offered  customer service  billing services  performance  perceived quality  reliability and availability 
current or future competitors could be substantially larger than we are  or have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
in the long distance market  we compete against at t alascom  acs  the matanuska telephone association and certain smaller rural local telephone carrier affiliates 
there is also the possibility that new competitors will enter the alaska market 
in addition  wireless services continue to grow as an alternative to wireline services as a means of reaching customers 
historically  we have competed in the long distance market by offering discounts from rates charged by our competitors and by providing desirable packages of services 
discounts have been eroded in recent years due to lowering of prices by at t alascom and entry of other competitors into the long distance markets we serve 
in addition  our competitors offer their own packages of services 
if competitors lower their rates further or develop more attractive packages of services  we may be forced to reduce our rates or add additional services  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
cable services 
our cable television systems face competition from alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals  including dbs and digital video over telephone lines  and from other sources of news  information and entertainment such as off air television broadcast programming  newspapers  movie theaters  live sporting events  interactive computer services  internet services and home video products  including videotape cassettes and video disks 
our cable television systems also face competition from potential overbuilds of our existing cable systems by other cable television operators and alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals 
the extent to which our cable television systems are competitive depends  in part  upon our ability to provide quality programming and other services at competitive prices 
our greatest source of competition for video services comes from the dbs industry 
we also are subject to digital video over telephone line competition in the mat su valley 
with the addition of anchorage local broadcast stations  increased marketing  ilec and dbs alliances  and emerging technologies creating new opportunities  competition from these sources has increased and will likely continue to increase 
the resulting increase in competition may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our cable television segment 
local telephone services 
in the local telephone market  we compete against acs  the ilec  in anchorage  juneau and fairbanks 
we also complete against at t alascom and telalaska in anchorage 
we may provide local telephone service in other locations in the future where we would face other competitors 
in the local telephone services market  the telecom act  judicial decisions and state legislative and regulatory developments have increased the likelihood that barriers to local telephone competition will be substantially reduced or removed 
these initiatives include requirements that lecs negotiate with entities  including us  to provide interconnection to the existing local telephone network  to allow the purchase  at cost based rates  of access to unbundled network elements  to establish dialing parity  to obtain access to rights of way and to resell services offered by the ilec 
we have been able to obtain interconnection  access and related services from the lecs at rates that allow us to offer competitive services 
however  if we are unable to continue to obtain these services and access at acceptable rates  our ability to offer local telephone services  and our revenues and net income  could be materially adversely affected 
to date  we have been successful in capturing a significant portion of the local telephone market in the locations where we are offering these services 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in attracting or retaining these customers 
internet services 
the internet industry is highly competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change 
competition is based upon price and pricing plans  service packages  the types of services offered  the technologies used  customer service  billing services  perceived quality  reliability and availability 
we compete with several alaska based internet providers and other domestic  non alaska based providers 
several of the providers have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
acs and other alaska telephone service providers are providing competitive high speed internet access over their telephone lines in direct competition with our high speed cable modem service 
dbs providers and others also provide wireless high speed internet service in competition with our high speed cable modem services 
competitive local fixed wireless providers are providing service in certain of our markets 
niche providers in the industry  both local and national  compete with certain of our internet service products  such as web hosting  list services and email 
the regulatory and legislative environment creates challenges for our business segments 
local telephone services 
our success in the local telephone market depends on our continued ability to obtain interconnection  access and related services from ilecs on terms that are just and reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services 
our local telephone services business faces the risk of the impact of implementing current regulations and legislation  unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations 
our ability to enter into the local telephone market depends on our negotiation or arbitration with ilecs to allow interconnection to the carrier s existing local telephone network  to allow the purchase  at cost based rates  of access to unbundled network elements  to establish dialing parity  to obtain access to rights of way and to resell services offered by the ilec 
in most alaska markets  it also depends on our ability to have the rural exemption for certain carriers terminated  so these carriers are obligated to provide access to unbundled network elements at economic costs 
future arbitration and rural exemption proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in our cost of serving these markets through the facilities of the ilec or via wholesale offerings 
acs  through subsidiary companies  provides local telephone services in fairbanks and juneau  alaska 
these acs subsidiaries are classified as rural telephone companies under the telecom act  which entitles them to an exemption of certain material interconnection terms of the telecom act  until and unless such rural exemption is examined and discontinued by the rca 
on october   the rca issued an order terminating rural exemptions for the acs subsidiaries operating in the fairbanks and juneau markets so that we could compete with these companies in the provision of local telephone service pursuant to the terms of section c of the telecom act 
these rural exemptions limited the obligation of the ilecs in these markets to provide us access to unbundled network elements at rates under the pricing standard established by the fcc 
upon appeal by acs  on december   the alaska supreme court issued a decision in which it reversed the rca s rural exemption decision on the procedural ground that the competitor  not the incumbent  must shoulder the burden of proof 
the court remanded the matter to the rca for reconsideration with the burden of proof assigned to us 
additionally  the court left it to the rca to decide as a matter of discretion whether to change the state of competition during the remand period 
in accordance with the court s ruling  the rca has re opened the rural exemption dockets and scheduled a hearing to commence on april  additionally  the rca issued a ruling on january   in which the commission determined that we can continue to rely on unbundled network elements from acs to serve our existing customers in juneau and fairbanks but that we may not serve new customers through purchase of unbundled network elements pending the completion of the remand proceeding 
until this matter is resolved  we may serve new customers using wholesale resale 
the outcome of this proceeding could result in a change in our cost of serving these markets via the facilities of acs or via wholesale offerings and could adversely impact our ability to offer local telephone service in these markets 
we believe it is unlikely that the rural exemptions will be restored in these markets  however  if they are restored  we could be forced to discontinue providing service to residential customers and perhaps to commercial customers in these locations 
cable services 
the cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation at various levels  and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals 
the law permits certified local franchising authorities to order refunds of rates paid in the previous month period determined to be in excess of the reasonable rates 
it is possible that rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees may be required of us in the future by state or federal regulators 
currently  pursuant to alaska law  the basic cable rates in juneau are the only rates in alaska subject to regulation by the local franchising authority  and the rates in juneau were reviewed and approved by the rca in october other existing federal regulations  including copyright licensing rules  are currently the subject of judicial  legislative  and administrative review that could change  in varying degrees  the manner in which cable television systems operate 
neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact upon the cable television industry in general  or on our activities and prospects in the cable television business in particular  can be predicted at this time 
there can be no assurance that future regulatory actions taken by congress  the fcc or other federal  state or local government authorities will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
proposals may be made before congress and the fcc to mandate cable operators provide open access over their cable systems to internet service providers 
the fcc has declined to impose such requirements through the date of this report 
if the fcc or other authorities mandate additional access to our cable systems  we cannot predict the effect that this would have on our internet service offerings 
internet services 
changes in the regulatory environment relating to the internet access market  including changes in legislation  fcc regulation  judicial action or local regulation that affect communications costs or increase competition from the ilec or other communications services providers  could adversely affect the prices at which we sell internet services 
we depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue and business 
for the year ended december   we provided long distance services excluding private lines and other revenue to mci and to sprint  which generated combined revenues of approximately of our total revenues for that year 
these two customers are free to seek out long distance communications services from our competitors upon expiration of their contracts in july in the case of mci  and in march in the case of sprint or earlier upon a default or the occurrence of a force majeure event or a substantial change in applicable law or regulation under the applicable contract 
mergers and acquisitions in the communications industry are relatively common 
if a change in control of mci or sprint were to occur  it would not permit them to terminate their existing contracts with us  but could in the future result in the termination of or a material adverse change in our relationships with them 
in addition  mci s and sprint s need for our long distance services depends directly upon their ability to obtain and retain their own long distance customers and upon the needs of those customers for long distance services 
the loss of one or both of mci or sprint as customers  a material adverse change in our relationships with either of them  or a material loss of or reduction in their long distance customers would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
our major customer  mci  is in bankruptcy 
on july   mci and substantially all of its active united states subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court 
chapter allows a company to continue operating in the ordinary course of business in order to maximize recovery for the company s creditors and shareholders 
on july   the bankruptcy court affirmed all of our existing contracts with mci and allowed us the right to  in lieu of collecting our pre petition claim of approximately million  set off certain of our pre petition accounts receivable from mci against amounts payable for future services purchased by us from mci 
the amount of the set off right was initially approximately million on july  and as of december   we have set off rights remaining totaling approximately million 
on october   mci s reorganization plan was approved by the united states bankruptcy court 
mci requested in february that the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york approve a day extension to the february  deadline to emerge from bankruptcy 
an extension to the deadline would give mci time to complete financial filings with the sec 
the financial filings are reported to be the last major task left for mci to emerge from bankruptcy 
we cannot predict what effect mci s bankruptcy and reorganization process may have on mci s demand for our services 
our businesses are currently geographically concentrated in alaska 
we offer voice and data communication and video services to customers primarily in the state of alaska 
because of this geographic concentration  our growth and operations depend upon economic conditions in alaska 
the economy of alaska is dependent upon natural resource industries  in particular oil production  as well as tourism  government spending and united states military spending 
any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on the demand for communication and cable television services and on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the customer base in alaska is limited 
alaska has a population of approximately  people  approximately of whom are located in the anchorage area 
we have already achieved significant market penetration with respect to our service offerings in anchorage and in other locations in alaska 
we may not be able to continue to increase our market share of the existing markets for our services and no assurance can be given that the alaskan economy will continue to grow and increase the size of the markets we serve or increase the demand for the services we offer 
as a result  the best opportunities for expanding our business may arise in other geographic areas such as the lower states 
there can be no assurance that we will find attractive opportunities to grow our businesses outside the state of alaska or that we will have the necessary expertise to take advantage of such opportunities 
the markets in alaska for voice and data communications and video services are unique and distinct within the united states due to alaska s large geographical size and its distance from the rest of the united states 
the expertise we have developed in operating our businesses in the state of alaska may not provide us with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets 
we may not develop our wireless services 
we offer wireless mobile services by reselling other providers wireless mobile services 
we offer wireless local telephone services over our own facilities  and have purchased pcs and lmds wireless broadband licenses in fcc auctions covering markets in alaska 
we have fewer subscribers to our wireless services than to our other service offerings 
the geographic coverage of our wireless services is also smaller than the geographic coverage of our other services 
some of our competitors offer or propose to offer an integrated bundle of communications  entertainment and information services  including wireless services 
if we are unable to expand and further develop our wireless services  we may not be able to meet the needs of customers who desire packaged services  and our competitors who offer these services would have an advantage 
this could result in the loss of market share for our other service offerings 
as a pcs and lmds licensee  we are subject to regulation by the fcc  and must comply with certain build out and other conditions of the licenses  as well as with the fcc s regulations governing the pcs and lmds services 
the conditions of our pcs licenses require us to meet certain build out requirements on or before july  we may not meet these build out requirements and  as a result  we could lose our pcs license 
our efforts to deploy dlps may be unsuccessful 
an element of our business strategy is to deploy voice telephone service utilizing our hybrid fiber coax cable facilities 
if we are able to deploy this service  we will be able to utilize our own cable facilities to provide local access to our customers and avoid paying local loop charges to the ilec 
to successfully deploy this service  we must integrate new technology with our existing facilities 
the viability of this service depends on the adoption of industry wide standards for the sending and receiving of voice communications over cable facilities and the availability of the equipment necessary to provide the service at a cost effective price 
the deployment of this service may require additional substantial capital investment by us 
if we are unable to successfully deploy dlps  we will not be able to recover any capital investment we may make and the margins on our local telephone services business will not improve 
prolonged service interruptions could affect our business 
we rely heavily on our network equipment  communications providers  data and software  to support all of our functions 
we rely on our networks and the networks of others for substantially all of our revenues 
we are able to deliver services only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damage from power or communication failures  computer viruses  natural disasters  unauthorized access and other disruptions 
while we endeavor to provide for failures in the network by providing back up systems and procedures  we cannot guarantee that these back up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency 
should we experience a prolonged failure  it could seriously jeopardize our ability to continue operations 
in particular  should a significant service interruption occur  our ongoing customers may choose a different provider  and our reputation may be damaged  reducing our attractiveness to new customers 
to the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our customers data or applications  or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information  we may incur liability and suffer from adverse publicity 
in addition  we may incur additional costs to remedy the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches 
if a failure occurs in our undersea fiber optic cable  our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited 
our communications facilities include an undersea fiber optic cable that carries a large portion of our internet voice and data traffic to and from the lower states 
we are currently constructing alternative communications facilities as backup facilities 
if a failure of our undersea fiber optic facilities occurs before we are able to complete construction of backup facilities and we are not able to secure alternative facilities  some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
if a failure occurs in our satellite communications systems  our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited 
we serve many rural and remote alaska locations solely via satellite communications 
each of our c and ku band satellite transponders is backed up on the same spacecraft with multiple backup transponders 
our primary spacecraft is panamsat s galaxy r g r  but we also lease capacity on two other spacecraft for services we provide  ses americom s amc and amc on g r  we use c band transponders 
we have arranged for backup c band satellite capacity on another panamsat spacecraft  galaxy g  for all of those satellite transponders in the unlikely event of a total primary spacecraft failure 
if such a failure occurs  service may not be fully restored for up to a week or longer due to the time necessary to redirect earth station antennae 
we also own one ku band satellite transponder on the same primary spacecraft g r that provides our c band service 
in the event of total primary spacecraft failure  we believe we would be able to restore our ku band transponder traffic on g  although no pre arrangement for its backup is currently in place 
we also lease approximately mhz of protected and backed up c band capacity on ses americom s amc spacecraft 
ses americom s amc is the backup spacecraft for amc we also lease certain c band transponder capacity on amc that can be preempted in the case of a satellite failure 
the services that are preempted would not be immediately restored should amc fail or be called up to provide restoration of another of ses americom s spacecraft 
we depend on a limited number of third party vendors to supply communications equipment 
we depend on a limited number of third party vendors to supply cable  internet  dlps  and telephony related equipment 
if our providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet our needs or provide them at an acceptable cost  we may not be able to satisfy demand for our services and competitors may fulfill this demand 
we do not have insurance to cover certain risks to which we are subject 
we are self insured for damage or loss to certain of our transmission facilities  including our buried  under sea  and above ground transmission lines 
if we become subject to substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities  our financial position  results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected 
a significant percentage of our voting securities are owned by a small number of shareholders and these shareholders can control stockholder decisions on very important matters 
as of december   our executive officers and directors and their affiliates owned approximately of our combined outstanding class a and class b common stock  representing approximately of the combined voting power of that stock including outstanding series b preferred stock voting with class a common stock on an as converted basis 
these shareholders can significantly influence  if not control  our management policy and all fundamental corporate actions  including mergers  substantial acquisitions and dispositions  and election of directors to the board 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred on september   and other attacks or acts of war may adversely affect us 
the attacks of september   and subsequent events have caused instability in the local  national and international economies and markets and have led  and may continue to lead  to further armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere  which could cause further instability in such economies and markets 
in addition  armed hostilities and further acts of terrorism may directly impact our physical facilities and operations or those of our customers 
furthermore  terrorist attacks  subsequent events and future developments may adversely affect our customers or their facilities or otherwise result in reduced demand from our customers for our services 
any of the foregoing could subject our operations to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt 
on december   we had total debt  including capital lease obligations  of approximately million 
our high level of debt could have important consequences  including the following o use of a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on the new senior notes  the senior credit facility and our other debt  which will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  and other business activities  o increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  o limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  o restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities  o make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt  o place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and o limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds  dispose of assets or pay cash dividends 
in addition  a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates 
if market interest rates increase  variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements  which would adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt  and to fund planned capital expenditures and business development efforts  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control 
we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
despite our current significant level of debt  we may still be able to incur substantially more debt 
this could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial debt 
we may be able to incur substantial debt in the future 
although our debt agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and  under certain circumstances  debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the substantial risks described above would intensify 
the terms of our debt impose  or will impose  restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
our debt agreements contain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to o incur additional debt and issue preferred stock  o pay dividends or make other restricted payments  o make certain investments  o create liens  o allow restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us  o sell assets  o merge or consolidate with other entities  and o enter into transactions with affiliates 
the senior credit facility also requires us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests  including  but not limited to  minimum interest coverage ratio  maximum leverage ratio and maximum annual capital expenditures 
these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest 
all of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations  and if such events occur  we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply 
a breach of these covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements 
employees we employed  persons as of january   and are not parties to union contracts with our employees 
we believe our future success will depend upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees 
we believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory 
other no material portion of our businesses is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to unbilled revenues  cost of sales and services accruals  allowance for doubtful accounts  depreciation  amortization and accretion periods  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

long distance services overview long distance services revenue in represented of consolidated revenues 
our provision of interstate and intrastate long distance services  private line and leased dedicated capacity services  and broadband services accounted for of our total long distance services revenues during factors that have the greatest impact on year to year changes in long distance services revenues include the rate per minute charged to customers  usage volumes expressed as minutes of use  and the number of private line  leased dedicated service and broadband products in use 
due in large part to the favorable synergistic effects of our bundling strategy  the long distance services segment continues to be a significant contributor to our overall performance  although the migration of traffic from voice to data and from fixed to mobile wireless continues 
our long distance services segment faces significant competition from at t alascom  long distance resellers  and local telephone companies that have entered the long distance market 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing long distance services and bundling different business segment services will continue to allow us to be competitive in providing those services 
our contract to provide interstate and intrastate long distance services to sprint was replaced in march extending its term to march with two one year automatic extensions to march beginning in april the new contract reduced the rate to be charged by us for certain sprint traffic over the extended term of the contract 
additional contractual rate reductions occur annually through the end of the initial term of the contract 
on july  mci and substantially all of its active united states subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court 
chapter allows a company to continue operating in the ordinary course of business in order to maximize recovery for the company s creditors and shareholders 
on july   the united states bankruptcy court approved a settlement agreement for pre petition amounts owed to us by mci and affirmed all of our existing contracts with mci 
on july   our contract to provide interstate and intrastate long distance services to mci was extended for a minimum of five years to july the agreement sets the terms and conditions under which we originate and terminate certain types of long distance and data services in alaska on mci s behalf 
in exchange for extending the term of this exclusive contract  mci will receive a series of rate reductions implemented in phases over the life of the contract 
other common carrier traffic routed to us for termination in alaska is largely dependent on traffic routed to mci and sprint by their customers 
pricing pressures  general economic deterioration  new program offerings  business failures  and market and business consolidations continue to evolve in the markets served by mci and sprint 
if  as a result  their traffic is reduced  or if their competitors costs to terminate or originate traffic in alaska are reduced  our traffic will also likely be reduced  and our pricing may be reduced to respond to competitive pressures 
additionally  a protracted economic malaise in the lower states or a further disruption in the economy resulting from terrorist attacks and other attacks or acts of war could affect our carrier customers 
we are unable to predict the effect on us of such changes  however given the materiality of other common carrier revenues to us  a significant reduction in traffic or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
at the time of mci s petition for bankruptcy  we had approximately million in receivables outstanding from mci 
at december  the bad debt reserve for uncollected amounts due from mci mci reserve totaled million and consisted of all billings for services rendered prior to july  that were not paid or deemed recoverable as of december  the settlement agreement approved by the united states bankruptcy court on july  settled unpaid balances due from mci for services rendered prior to their bankruptcy filing date  settled billing disputes between us  and established a right to set off certain of our pre petition accounts payable to mci 
under the terms of the agreement  we reduced the pre petition amounts receivable from mci by  and off set our pre petition accounts payable by million 
the majority of the difference reduced the mci reserve with the remainder recorded as bad debt expense 
the remaining pre petition accounts receivable balance owed by mci to us after this settlement was million mci credit which we have and will use as a credit against amounts payable for services purchased from mci 
at settlement  all of the remaining pre petition amounts receivable due from mci  which were fully reserved  were removed from accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
after settlement  we began reducing the mci credit as we utilized it for services otherwise payable to mci 
the use of the credit is recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense 
during we utilized approximately million of the mci credit against amounts payable for services received from mci 
the remaining unused mci credit totaled million at december  the credit balance is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as we are recognizing recovery of bad debt expense as the credit is utilized 
on october   mci s reorganization plan was approved by the united states bankruptcy court 
the court order provided for a february  deadline for mci to emerge from bankruptcy 
in february mci asked the court for a day extension to the february deadline to allow it to complete financial filings with the sec 
the financial filings are reported to be the last major task left for mci to emerge from bankruptcy 
we expect to evaluate the likelihood that we will receive full recovery of bad debt expense for our remaining credit balance when mci exits bankruptcy proceedings and may change our recognition method at that time 
long distance services segment revenues total long distance services segment revenues decreased to million in the components of long distance services segment revenues are as follows amounts in thousands percentage change common carrier message telephone services   residential  commercial and governmental message telephone services   private line and private network services   broadband services   lease of fiber optic cable system capacity   total long distance services segment revenue   common carrier message telephone services revenue the decrease in message telephone service revenues from other common carriers principally mci and sprint results from the following o a decrease in the average rate per minute on minutes carried for other common carriers primarily due to the decreased average rate per minute as agreed to in the july  extension of our contract to provide interstate and intrastate long distance services to mci  o a discount given to a certain other common carrier customer starting in  and o revenue earned due to a increase in the rate per minute of certain other common carrier minutes retroactive to april which did not recur in the decrease in message telephone service revenues from other common carriers in was off set by a increase in wholesale minutes carried to million minutes

the decrease in message telephone service revenues from residential  commercial  and governmental customers in is primarily due to the following o a decrease in minutes carried for these customers primarily due to the effect of customers substituting cellular phone  prepaid calling card and email usage for direct dial minutes  o a decrease in the average rate per minute primarily due to our promotion of and customers enrollment in calling plans offering a certain number of minutes for a flat monthly fee  and o a decrease in the number of active residential  commercial  and governmental customers billed primarily due to the effect of customers substituting cellular phone  prepaid calling card  and email usage for direct dial minutes 
broadband services revenue the increase in revenues from our packaged telecommunications offering to rural hospitals and health clinics and our schoolaccess tm offering to rural school districts in is primarily due to the following o our new schoolaccess tm offering called distance learning service that started in late distance learning service is a video conference based service that enables eight school districts in alaska to provide additional educational opportunities for their students  and o an increased number of circuits leased to rural hospitals and health clinics in alaska 
long distance services segment cost of sales and services long distance services segment cost of sales and services decreased to million in long distance services segment cost of sales and services as a percentage of long distance services segment revenues decreased from in to in primarily due to the following o reductions in access costs due to distribution and termination of our traffic on our own local access services network instead of paying other carriers to distribute and terminate our traffic 
the statewide average cost savings is approximately 
and 
per minute for interstate and intrastate traffic  respectively 
we expect cost savings to continue to occur as long distance traffic originated  carried  and terminated on our own facilities grows  o the fcc multi association group mag reform order reducing the interstate access rates paid by interexchange carriers to lecs beginning july  o a million refund million after deducting certain direct costs in from a local exchange carrier in respect of its earnings that exceeded regulatory requirements  and o a million refund in from an intrastate access cost pool that previously overcharged us for access services 
the decrease in the long distance services segment cost of sales and services as a percentage of long distance services segment revenues is partially off set by the following o increased costs associated with additional transponder and network back up capacity in as compared to  o a discount given to a certain other common carrier customer starting in the third quarter of without a corresponding decrease in the cost of sales and services  and o the decreased average rate per minute on minutes carried for other common carriers as agreed to in the july  extension of our contract to provide interstate and intrastate long distance services to mci 
cable services overview cable television revenues in represented of consolidated revenues 
our cable systems serve communities and areas in alaska  including the state s four largest population centers  anchorage  fairbanks  the matanuska susitna valley and juneau 
we generate cable services revenues from four primary sources digital and analog programming services  including monthly basic and premium subscriptions  pay per view movies and other one time events  such as sporting events  equipment rentals and installation  cable modem services shared with our internet services segment  and advertising sales 
during programming services generated of total cable services revenues  cable services allocable share of cable modem services accounted for of such revenues  equipment rental and installation fees accounted for of such revenues  advertising sales accounted for of such revenues  and other services accounted for the remaining of total cable services revenues 
effective february  we increased rates charged for certain cable services and premium packages in six communities  including three of the state s four largest population centers  anchorage  fairbanks and juneau 
rates increased approximately for those customers who experienced an adjustment 
the primary factors that contribute to year to year changes in cable services revenues include average monthly subscription and pay per view rates  the mix among basic  premium and pay per view services and digital and analog services  the average number of cable television and cable modem subscribers during a given reporting period  and revenues generated from new product offerings 
in the second quarter of we signed seven year retransmission agreements with the five local anchorage broadcasters and began up linking and distributing the local anchorage programming to all of our cable systems 
this local programming provides additional value to our cable subscribers that not all our dbs competitors can provide 
in dbs service provider dish network echostar communications corporation began providing  for an additional fee  anchorage based broadcaster programming in anchorage and in other alaska communities where there is not a similar local broadcast affiliate 
cable services segment revenues and cost of sales and services selected key performance indicators for our cable services segment follow percentage change basic subscribers   digital special interest subscribers   cable modem subscribers   homes passed   total cable services segment revenues increased to million and average gross revenue per average basic subscriber per month increased or in programming services revenues increased to million in resulting from the following o an increase in the number of digital subscribers  and o the february rate increase of approximately for those customers who experienced an adjustment 
the increase in programming services revenue is partially off set by a decrease in basic subscribers due to increased competition from dbs 
the cable services segment s share of cable modem revenue offered through our internet services segment increased to million in due to an increased number of cable modems deployed 
approximately of our cable homes passed are able to subscribe to our cable modem service 
in the second quarter of we completed our upgrade of the ketchikan cable system 
customers in this system are now able to subscribe to cable modem service 
we now offer digital programming service in anchorage  the matanuska susitna valley  fairbanks  juneau  ketchikan  kenai  and soldotna  representing approximately of our total homes passed at december  we launched digital programming services in the matanuska susitna valley and ketchikan cable systems in cable services cost of sales and services increased to million in due to programming cost increases for most of our cable programming services offerings 
cable services cost of sales and services as a percentage of cable services revenues increased from in to in primarily due to rate increases by programming vendors exceeding our rate adjustments 
cost of sales increases are partially off set by increasing amounts of cable modem services sold that generally have higher margins than do cable programming services 
multiple system operator mso operating statistics in october we  along with the other largest publicly traded msos  signed a pledge to support and adhere to new voluntary reporting guidelines on common operating statistics to provide investors and others with a better understanding of our operations 
our operating statistics include capital expenditures and customer information from our cable services segment and the components of our local access services and internet services segments which offer services utilizing our cable services facilities 
our capital expenditures by standard reporting category for the year ending december  and follows amounts in thousands customer premise equipment   commercial scalable infrastructure   line extensions  upgrade rebuild   support capital  sub total   remaining reportable segments and all other capital expenditures   the standardized definition of a customer relationship is the number of customers that receive at least one level of service  encompassing voice  video  and data services  without regard to which services customers purchase 
at december  and we had  and  customer relationships  respectively 
the standardized definition of a revenue generating unit is the sum of all primary analog video  digital video  high speed data  and telephony customers  not counting additional outlets 
at december  and we had  and  revenue generating units  respectively 
local access services overview we generate local access services revenues from three primary sources business and residential basic dial tone services  business private line and special access services  and business and residential features and other charges  including voice mail  caller id  distinctive ring  inside wiring and subscriber line charges 
during local access services revenues represented of consolidated revenues 
the primary factors that contribute to year to year changes in local access services revenues include the average number of business and residential subscribers to our services during a given reporting period  the average monthly rates charged for non traffic sensitive services  the number and type of additional premium features selected  and the traffic sensitive access rates charged to carriers and the universal service program 
our local access services segment faces significant competition in anchorage  fairbanks  and juneau from acs  which is the largest ilec in alaska  and from at t alascom  inc we began providing service in the juneau market in the first quarter of we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing local access services and bundling different business segment services will allow us to be competitive in providing those services 
we have been testing the deployment of voice telephone service utilizing our coaxial cable facilities 
if we are able to deploy this service  we will be able to utilize our own cable facilities to provide local access to our customers and avoid paying local loop charges to the ilec 
to successfully deploy this service  we must integrate new technology with our existing facilities and the industry must adopt standards for the sending and receiving of voice communications over cable facilities 
to ensure the necessary equipment is available to us we have committed to purchase a certain number of outdoor  network powered multi media adapters  as further disclosed below in liquidity and capital resources 
we expect to begin implementing this service delivery method in the second quarter of at december    lines were in service as compared to approximately  lines in service at december  at december  approximately  additional lines were awaiting connection 
we estimate that our lines in service total represents a statewide market share of approximately 
our access line mix at december  follows o residential lines represent approximately of our lines  o business customers represent approximately of our lines  and o internet access customers represent approximately of our lines 
approximately of our lines are provided on our own facilities and leased local loops 
approximately of our lines are provided using une platform 
in december we distributed our new phone directory and began recognizing revenue and costs of sales and service in the local access services segment 
we recognized one month of revenue and cost of sales and service in the fourth quarter of and we plan to recognize the remaining eleven months in operating expenses incurred and recognized throughout to prepare our new phone directory are reported in the local access services segment 
local access services segment revenues and cost of sales and services local access services segment revenues increased in to million primarily due to the following o growth in the average lines in service  o million of support from the universal service program  and o a change in how we provision local access lines in fairbanks and juneau 
in we primarily resold service purchased from acs 
in we are benefiting from our facilities build out with an increased number of access lines provisioned on our own facilities using unes  allowing us to collect interstate and intrastate access revenues 
local access services segment cost of sales and services increased to million in local access services segment cost of sales and services as a percentage of local access services segment revenues decreased from in to in  primarily due to the million of support from the universal service program and reductions in access costs attributed to our conversion of service provided on a wholesale basis to service provided through our own facilities 
the local access services segment operating results are negatively affected by the allocation of the benefit of access cost savings to the long distance services segment 
if the local access services segment received credit for the access charge reductions recorded by the long distance services segment  the local access services segment operating results would have improved by approximately million and the long distance services segment operating results would have been reduced by an equal amount in avoided access charges totaled approximately million in the local access services segment operating results are affected by our continued evaluation and testing of digital local phone service and internet protocol based technology to deliver phone service through our cable facilities 
internet services overview we generate internet services revenues from three primary sources access product services  including commercial  internet service provider  and retail dial up access  network management services  and internet services allocable share of cable modem revenue a portion of cable modem revenue is also recognized by our cable services segment 
during internet services segment revenues represented of consolidated revenues 
the primary factors that contribute to year to year changes in internet services revenues include the average number of subscribers to our services during a given reporting period  the average monthly subscription rates  the amount of bandwidth purchased by large commercial customers  and the number and type of additional premium features selected 
marketing campaigns continue to be deployed targeting residential and commercial customers featuring bundled products 
our internet offerings are bundled with our long distance and or local access services offerings and provide free basic internet services or discounted premium internet services if certain long distance and local access services plans are selected 
in we have added cable service to our bundled offering 
value added premium internet features are available for additional charges 
we compete with a number of internet service providers in our markets 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing internet services allows us to be competitive in providing those services 
during we upgraded the download speeds of all of our cable modem internet service offerings 
these enhancements have proven to be popular with our customers which we believe is helping to further solidify our customer relationships 
internet services segment revenues and cost of sales and services selected key performance indicators for our internet services segment follow percentage change total internet subscribers   cable modem subscribers   dial up subscribers   total internet services segment revenues increased to million in primarily due to the increase in its allocable share of cable modem revenues to million in as compared to the increase in cable modem revenues is primarily due to growth in cable modem subscribers and the termination in the first quarter of of our offering in which customers received up to two months of free cable modem service 
additionally  the growth in cable modem revenues is affected by the level of service our subscribers select 
in and  and  respectively  of our subscribers selected our highest level of cable modem service resulting in increased revenue of approximately  in as compared to we previously reported a total of  internet subscribers at december  this subscriber count was based upon the total number of active dial up subscribers at december  not all cable modem subscribers paying for a dial up plan have activated their dial up service 
when we first started selling cable modem service it was packaged in a way that almost all cable modem subscribers were also dial up subscribers 
as we introduced new packages and plans and started promoting our cable modem litespeed service the number of cable modem subscribers without a dial up plan increased substantially 
an internal review during the second quarter of revealed that these subscriber counts had risen substantially enough that they are now being reported separately 
internet services cost of sales and services increased to million in  and as a percentage of internet services revenues  totaled and in and  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of internet services revenues is primarily due to the increase in internet s portion of cable modem revenue which generally has higher margins than do other internet services products 
as internet services revenues increase  economies of scale and more efficient network utilization continue to result in reduced internet cost of sales and services as a percentage of revenues 
all other services overview revenues reported in the all other category as described in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements include our managed services  product sales  and cellular telephone services 
revenues included in the all other category represented of total revenues in all other revenues and costs of sales and services all other revenues increased to million in the increase in revenues is primarily due to the following o increased monthly revenue earned from our gci fiber system that transits the trans alaska oil pipeline corridor  and o million in special project revenue earned from our gci fiber system in all other costs of sales and services increased to million in  and as a percentage of all other revenues  totaled and in and  respectively 
the decrease in all other costs of sales and services as a percentage of all other revenues is primarily due to the following o increased monthly revenue earned from our recurring service contracts in which exceeds the corresponding increase in costs of sales or services  and o the recognition of million in special project revenue earned in which exceeds the corresponding increase in costs of sales or services 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in and  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to a million increase in labor and health insurance costs and a million increase in the accrual for company wide success sharing bonus costs 
marketing and advertising expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in bad debt expense recovery bad debt expense recovery decreased to  in the decrease is primarily due to the following o utilization of approximately million of the mci credit as a reduction to bad debt expense in  as further discussed in the long distance service overview above  and o provision in of a million bad debt reserve for uncollected amounts due from mci  as further discussed in the long distance service overview above 
impairment charge in  we reported an impairment charge of million which equaled the remaining net book value recorded for our north pacific cable asset 
in we purchased one ds of capacity on a fiber optic cable system owned by at t 
this fiber optic cable system is a spur off of a trans pacific fiber optic cable system owned by another group 
we used our owned capacity to carry traffic to and from alaska and the lower states 
the section of the north pacific cable in which we own capacity was taken out of service in january due to a billing dispute between at t and the owner of the trans pacific cable system causing us to re route certain of our traffic 
we believe it is probable that we will not return our traffic to the north pacific cable even if it is placed back into service 
we have requested in writing to be relieved of all future obligations required by our purchase agreement 
should our request be accepted  we expect to cease payment of maintenance and vessel standby costs totaling approximately  per year that would otherwise be payable over the remaining life of the system 
the fiber optic cable system we are building is scheduled for completion in may and will provide us with route diversity and redundancy far in excess of that previously provided by the north pacific cable 
depreciation  amortization and accretion expense depreciation  amortization and accretion expense decreased to million in the decrease is primarily attributed to a reduction in the depreciable value of property and equipment due to a basis adjustment of million which was recorded in associated with the kanas telecom  inc acquisition  and a reduction of million in depreciation expense which was also associated with the acquisition 
the decrease in depreciation  amortization and accretion expense described above was partially off set by an increase in depreciation expense due to our million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  and the million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased to million in the increase is primarily due to the following o as described further in liquidity and capital resources below  we recognized approximately million in amortization of loan and senior notes fees in because a portion of the new senior credit facility was a substantial modification of the april  amended senior credit facility  o increased interest expense due to increased interest rates on our amended senior credit facility from october through october  when the amended senior credit facility was replaced with the new senior credit facility  o increased amortization of loan fees due to additional loan fees incurred to amend our senior credit facility  and o a million interest benefit earned in from an interest rate swap agreement which was called at no cost by the counter party and terminated on august  partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in the average outstanding indebtedness in and decreased interest expense in november and december due to the decreased interest rate paid on our new senior credit facility 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in and million in the change was due to increased net income before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in as compared to our effective income tax rate decreased from in to in due to the effect of items that are nondeductible for income tax purposes and adjustments made to ending temporary difference balances in at december   we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that will begin expiring in if not utilized  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years 
our utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards is subject to limitations pursuant to internal revenue code section tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense 
we estimate that our effective income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be to in cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on january  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and recorded the cumulative effect of accretion and depreciation expense as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of approximately  net of income tax benefit of  year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview of revenues and cost of sales and services total revenues increased from million in to million in excluding revenues from the fiber optic cable system capacity sale of million in as described in note r in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  total revenues increased in the long distance services  cable services  local access services and internet services segments contributed to the increase in total revenues  partially off set by decreased revenues from all other services

the increase is primarily due to the addition in the second quarter of of two new subscribers to our rural hospital and health clinic service for which we recognized a full year of revenue in  and our new schoolaccess tm product offering called distance learning that started in late distance learning is a video conference based service and is used by six school districts in alaska in long distances services segment cost of sales and services long distance services segment cost of sales and services decreased to million in long distance services segment cost of sales and services as a percentage of long distance services segment revenues decreased from in to in primarily due to the following o reductions in access costs due to distribution and termination of our traffic on our own local access services network instead of paying other carriers to distribute and terminate our traffic 
the statewide average cost savings is approximately 
and 
per minute for interstate and intrastate traffic  respectively 
we expect cost savings to continue to occur as long distance traffic originated  carried  and terminated on our own facilities grows  o the fcc mag reform order reducing the interstate access rates paid by interexchange carriers to lecs in january and again in july  and o in the course of business we estimate unbilled long distance services cost of sales and services based upon minutes of use processed through our network and established rates 
such estimates are revised when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
in and  we had favorable and unfavorable adjustments of million and million  respectively 
excluding the adjustments  long distance services cost of sales and services as a percentage of long distance services revenues was and in and  respectively 
long distance services cost of sales and services in included a reversal of million in accrued costs upon the conclusion of a dispute with acs and a  non recurring refund from acs in respect of its earnings that exceeded regulatory requirements 
cable services segment revenues and cost of sales and services selected key performance indicators for our cable services segment follow percentage change basic subscribers   digital special interest subscribers   cable modem subscribers   homes passed   cable services segment revenues increased to million and average gross revenue per average basic subscriber per month increased or in the increases in revenues and rates per subscriber were accomplished without any meaningful rate increases during and are due primarily to continued deployment of our high value services including digital cable television and cable modems 
programming services revenues increased to million in due to an increase in basic and digital subscribers 
the cable services segment s share of cable modem revenue offered through our internet services segment increased million to million in due to an increased number of cable modems deployed 
approximately of our cable homes passed are able to subscribe to our cable modem service in at december  we offered digital programming in anchorage  fairbanks  juneau  kenai  and soldotna  which markets represented approximately of our homes passed 
homes passed increased at december  as compared to december  due to new facility construction efforts 
in the second quarter of we signed new seven year retransmission agreements with the five local anchorage broadcasters and began up linking and distributing the local anchorage programming to all of our cable systems 
this was done to provide additional value to our cable subscribers and to allow us to differentiate our programming from that of our dbs competitors 
cable services cost of sales and services increased to million in cable services cost of sales and services as a percentage of cable services revenues  which is less as a percentage of revenues than are long distance  local access and internet services cost of sales and services  decreased from in to in revenues earned from equipment rental and installation  cable services allocable share of cable modem services and advertising sales do not have significant corresponding costs of sales and services 
the decrease in cable services cost of sales and services as a percentage of cable services revenues is primarily due to an increase in the percentage of cable services revenues earned from equipment rental and installation  cable services allocable share of cable modem services and advertising sales from in to in the decrease in cable services cost of sales and services as a percentage of cable services revenues described above is off set by an increase in cable programming services cost of sales and services as a percentage of cable programming services revenue from in to in cable services rate increases did not keep pace with programming cost increases in programming costs increased for most of our cable services offerings  and we incurred additional costs on new programming introduced in and local access services segment revenues and cost of sales and services local access services segment revenues increased in to million primarily due to growth in the average lines in service 
at december  an estimated  lines were in service as compared to approximately  lines in service at december  at december  approximately  additional lines were awaiting connection 
the increase in local access services revenues described above was partially off set by the following o the fcc mag reform order reducing the interstate access rates paid by interexchange carriers to lecs in january and again in july  and o a reduction in interstate access rates charged by us to interexchange carriers in response to an fcc order forcing a competitor to reduce their interstate access rates 
we estimate that our lines in service total represented a statewide market share of approximately 
our access line mix continued to hold steady in  with residential lines representing approximately of our lines  business customers representing approximately  and internet access customers representing approximately 
approximately of our lines are provided on our own facilities or using leased local loops 
local access services cost of sales and services increased to million in local access services cost of sales and services as a percentage of local access services revenues increased from in to in  primarily due to the following o the effect of offering one to two months of free service to significant numbers of new local access services customers acquired in while continuing to incur cost of sales and services for such new customers  o the lease of wholesale circuits from acs in fairbanks and juneau pending completion of our facilities enabling service transition to une facilities and pricing  and o an increase in the anchorage loop lease rates 
acs requested and received permission for a increase in the une loop rate to per month and a increase in their retail residential rates  both effective in november the wholesale service rate we pay is tied to the retail residential rate and increased approximately per line per month 
additionally  the cost of most residential features increased to approximately per line per month 
the increased rates resulted in an approximately million increase in our local access services cost of sales and services in without a corresponding increase in our revenue 
the increases in local access services cost of sales and services as a percentage of local access services revenues described above are partially offset by further economies of scale and more efficient network utilization as the number of local access services subscribers and resulting revenues increase 
the size of the local access services segment operating loss is exacerbated by the allocation of the benefit of access cost savings to the long distance services segment 
if the local access services segment received credit for the access charge reductions recorded by the long distance services segment  the local access services segment operating loss would have decreased by approximately million and the long distance services segment would be reduced by an equal amount in avoided access charges totaled approximately million in the local access services segment operating loss was affected by the expected start up losses we experienced in the new fairbanks and juneau markets and our continued evaluation and testing of dlps technology 
internet services segment revenues and cost of sales and services selected key performance indicators for our internet services segment follow percentage change total internet subscribers   cable modem subscribers   dial up subscribers   internet services segment revenues increased to million in primarily due to growth in the number of customers served and the increase in its allocable share of cable modem revenues in as compared to the increase in cable modem revenue is primarily due to growth in the number of cable modem subscribers from to and our subscribers more frequent selection of our highest level of cable modem service 
internet services cost of sales and services increased to million in  and as a percentage of internet services revenues  totaled and in and  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of internet services revenues is primarily due to the increase in internet s portion of cable modem revenue which generally has higher margins than do other internet services products 
as internet services revenues increase  economies of scale and more efficient network utilization continue to result in reduced internet cost of sales and services as a percentage of revenues 
we enhanced the value of our internet offerings in through the addition of electronic billing and presentment capabilities and the rollout of a product called e mail guard  which filters out e mail spam and viruses 
in we upgraded the download speeds of all of our cable modem internet service offerings 
these new services and enhancements have proven to be very popular with our customers and are helping to further solidify our customer relationships 
all other revenues and cost of sales and services the decrease in all other revenues to million in is primarily due to the million fiber optic cable system capacity sale in  as described in note r in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in revenues is partially offset by a million increase in managed services revenue to million in primarily due to the provision of additional services to and increased revenues from a certain customer as performance criteria was met 
all other costs of sales and services decreased to million in primarily due to million in costs of sale for the fiber optic cable system capacity sale in as a percentage of all other revenues  all other costs of sales and services totaled and in and  respectively 
excluding revenues from the fiber optic cable system capacity sale  cost of sales and services as a percentage of revenues totaled and in and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to the provision of additional services to and increased revenues from a certain customer as performance criteria was met without a corresponding increase in cost of sales and services 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in and  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in excluding the fiber optic cable system capacity sale in  selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  increased from in to in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased labor and health insurance costs  incremental new costs to operate gfcc and rogers  and costs incurred for our unsuccessful bid to purchase certain of the assets of wci cable  inc  partially offset by a decreased accrual for company wide success sharing bonus costs 
marketing and advertising expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in excluding revenues from the fiber optic cable system capacity sale in  marketing and advertising expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in bad debt expense bad debt expense increased to million in and  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in excluding revenues from the fiber optic cable system capacity sale in  bad debt expense as a percentage of total revenues was in the increase is primarily due to the million bad debt expense for uncollected accounts due from mci 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase of to million in depreciation expense due to our million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  and the million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a partial year of depreciation will be recorded in partially offsetting the depreciation expense increase described above is the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and cable certificates upon the adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on january   resulting in a decrease in amortization expense of approximately million as compared to other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased to million in the increase is primarily due to the following o a million increase in deferred loan fee expense to million primarily due to the recognition of million in unamortized deferred loan fees upon refinancing our senior credit facility and fiber facility  and o increased interest expense in november and december due to the increased interest rate paid on our amended senior credit facility starting november  partially offsetting these increases were decreased interest rates on our senior credit facility and fiber facility through november  income tax expense income tax expense was million in and million in the increase was due to increased net income before income taxes in as compared to our effective income tax rate decreased from in to in due to the effect of items that are nondeductible for income tax purposes

the following describes unusual or infrequently occurring items recognized in the following quarters of and o in the fourth quarter of we reported an impairment charge of million which equaled the remaining net book value recorded for our north pacific cable asset  as discussed in impairment charge above  o in the fourth quarter of we recognized approximately million in amortization of loan and senior notes fees due to classifying a portion of the new senior credit facility described further in liquidity and capital resources below as a substantial modification of the april  amended senior credit facility  and o in the second and third quarters of we recognized million and million  respectively  in bad debt expense for uncollected accounts due from mci 
in the third and fourth quarters of we recognized approximately  and million  respectively  in recoveries of bad debt expense for uncollected accounts due from mci 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities totaled million in as compared to million in the increase is primarily due to increased cash flow from all of our reportable segments  a million refund from a local exchange carrier in respect of its earnings that exceeded regulatory requirements  receipt of million in payments of notes receivable from related parties issued upon stock option exercise  and a million refund from an intrastate access cost pool that previously overcharged us for access services 
uses of cash during included expenditures of million for property and equipment  including construction in progress  principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations of million  payment of million to purchase other assets and intangible assets  payment of million in fees associated with the amended and new senior credit facility  and payment of preferred stock dividends of million 
net receivables increased million from december  to december  primarily due to increases in the following o trade receivables for broadband services provided to hospitals and health clinics  o trade receivables for special project revenue earned from a certain customer  o trade receivables for telecommunication services provided to a certain customer  o trade receivable for estimated support from the universal service program  and o trade receivable for directory advertising services associated with our new phone directory 
working capital totaled million at december   a million increase as compared to million at december  the increase is primarily attributed to the following o million of the million increase in net receivables at december  the remaining increase in trade receivables does not result in a significant change in working capital due to an off set reported in current liabilities  o a million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments for cost of sales and service and the bankruptcy settlement with mci in july as further discussed in long distance services overview above  partially off set by increased accounts payable associated with the construction of our new fiber optic cable system  and o a million increase in the current portion of notes receivable from related parties at december  as compared to december  the increase in working capital was partially off set by the following o a million increase in accrued payroll primarily due to an increased accrual for company wide success sharing bonus costs  and o an increase of million in the current maturity of our satellite transponder lease obligation 
in february gci s wholly owned subsidiary gci  inc sold million in aggregate principal amount of senior debt securities due february  new senior notes 
the new senior notes are an unsecured senior obligation 
we will pay interest of on the new senior notes  which were sold at a discount of million 
the new senior notes will be carried on our balance sheet net of the unamortized portion of the discount  which will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the new senior notes 
the net proceeds of the offering were primarily used to repay our existing million senior notes old senior notes and to repay approximately million of the term portion and million of the revolving portion of our new senior credit facility 
semi annual interest payments of approximately million will be due beginning august  in connection with the issuance  we paid fees and other expenses of approximately million which will be amortized over the life of the new senior notes 
the new senior notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a and non united states persons pursuant to regulation s 
the new senior notes have not been registered under the securities act and  unless so registered  may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from  or in a transaction not subject to  the registration requirements of the securities act and applicable state securities laws 
we plan to register our new senior notes by june  the new senior notes are not redeemable prior to february  at any time on or after february   the new senior notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  on not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days notice  at the following redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the date of redemption if redeemed during the twelve month period commencing february of the year indicated redemption price and thereafter we may  on or prior to february   at our option  use the net cash proceeds of one or more underwritten public offerings of our qualified stock to redeem up to a maximum of of the initially outstanding aggregate principal amount of our new senior notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the new senior notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  thereon to the date of redemption  provided that not less than of the principal amount of the new senior notes originally issued remain outstanding following such a redemption 
the new senior notes restrict gci  inc and certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt in most circumstances unless the result of incurring debt does not cause our leverage ratio to exceed to one 
the new senior notes do not allow debt under the new senior credit facility to exceed the greater of and reduced by certain stated items o million  reduced by the amount of any prepayments  or o times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for the last four full fiscal quarters of gci  inc and certain of its subsidiaries 
the new senior notes limit our ability to make cash dividend payments 
we are conducting a consent solicitation and tender offer for the old senior notes 
through february  we accepted for payment million principal amount of notes which were validly tendered 
such notes accepted for payment received additional consideration as follows o million based upon a payment of  per  principal amount  consisting of the purchase price of  per  principal amount and the consent payment of per  principal amount  and o  in accrued and unpaid interest through february  the remaining principal amount of million will be redeemed by march  for additional consideration as follows o million based upon a payment of per  principal amount  and o  in estimated accrued and unpaid interest through the expected date of redemption march  the total estimated redemption cost is expected to be million 
the premium to redeem our old senior notes is expected to be million excluding estimated interest cost of million  which will be recognized as a component of other income expense during the three months ended march  compliance with the redemption notice requirements in the indenture will result in a delay of up to sixty days before final redemption of some of the old senior notes 
as a result of such delay  our total debt will increase during the overlap period between the redemption of the outstanding old senior notes and the issuance of the new senior notes making us out of compliance with section of our credit  guaranty  security and pledge agreement  dated as of october  we have received a waiver from compliance with section until april  on april  we amended our million senior credit facility 
on october  we closed a new million senior credit facility to replace the april  amended senior credit facility 
the new senior credit facility reduced the interest rate from libor plus to libor plus 
the new senior credit facility includes a term loan of million and a revolving credit facility of million 
the repayment schedule for the term loan portion of the new senior credit facility  after considering repayments from our new senior notes offering proceeds  is as follows amounts in thousands date amount quarter ended december  quarterly from march  to december   quarterly from march  to september   the remaining balance of the new senior credit facility will be payable in full on october  we are required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the commitment 
we may not permit the total leverage ratio as defined  the senior secured leverage ratio as defined  and the interest coverage ratio as defined to exceed certain amounts over the life of the new senior credit facility 
capital expenditures  excluding up to million incurred to build or acquire additional fiber optic cable system capacity between alaska and the lower states  in any of the years ended december   and may not exceed o million  plus o of any excess cash flow as defined during the applicable period less certain permitted investments during the applicable period 
if the revolving credit facility exceeds million  we may not incur capital expenditures  other than those incurred to build or acquire additional fiber optic cable system capacity  in excess of million 
the new senior credit facility requirement that we must either have repaid in full or successfully refinanced our old senior notes by february  was met with the refinancing of our old senior notes  as previously discussed 
million of the new senior credit facility has been used to provide a letter of credit to secure payment for our contract for the design  engineering  manufacture and installation of the new undersea fiber optic cable system 
the letter of credit will be reduced to million after a contract payment estimated to be made in march the letter of credit will be cancelled after the final contract payment date estimated to be in april in connection with the april  amended senior credit facility  we paid bank fees and other expenses of approximately million during the year ended december  in connection with the new senior credit facility  we paid bank fees and other expenses of  during the three months ended december  which will be amortized over the life of the new senior credit facility 
because a portion of the new senior credit facility was a substantial modification of the april  amended senior credit facility  we recognized approximately million in amortization of loan and senior notes fees during the three months ended december  the remaining million in amended senior credit facility deferred loan costs will continue to be amortized over the life of the new senior credit facility 
the term loan is fully drawn and we have letters of credit totaling million  which left million available at december  to draw under the revolving credit facility if needed 
in january we drew million under the revolving credit facility 
our ability to draw down on the revolver portion of our new senior credit facility could be diminished if we are not in compliance with all new senior credit facility covenants or have a material adverse change at the date of the request for the draw 
in september and december we made scheduled principal payments on our term loan totaling million 
in april  we made a million principal payment on the revolving credit facility 
as described above  we issued new senior notes in february and used a portion of the proceeds to repay approximately million of the term portion and million of the revolving portion of our new senior credit facility 
we were in compliance with all loan covenants at december  our expenditures for property and equipment  including construction in progress  totaled million and million during and  respectively 
our capital expenditures requirements in excess of approximately million per year are largely success driven and are a result of the progress we are making in the marketplace 
we expect our expenditures for property and equipment for our core operations  including construction in progress and excluding the new fiber system construction costs and other special projects described below  to total million to million  depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during we are constructing a fiber optic cable system connecting seward  alaska and warrenton  oregon  with leased backhaul facilities to connect it to our switching and distribution centers in anchorage  alaska and seattle  washington 
the  statute mile cable system has a total design capacity of gigabits per second access speed and is planned to be operational by may the cable will complement our existing fiber optic cable system between whittier  alaska and seattle  washington 
the two cables will provide physically diverse backup to each other in the event of an outage 
we expect to fund construction costs that are expected to total million through our operating cash flows and  to the extent necessary  with draws on our new senior credit facility 
during our capital expenditures for this project have totaled approximately million  all of which has been funded through our operating cash flows 
planned capital expenditures over the next five years include those necessary for continued expansion of our long distance  local exchange and internet facilities  supplementing our existing network backup facilities  continuing development of our pcs network to meet the requirements of our license  digital local phone service  and upgrades to our cable television plant 
we are testing the deployment of dlps 
we expect to begin implementing this service delivery method in the second quarter of to ensure the necessary equipment is available to us we have entered into an agreement to purchase a certain number of outdoor  network powered multi media adapters 
the agreement has a remaining outstanding commitment at december  of million 
we believe that payment for services provided to mci subsequent to their bankruptcy filing date will continue to be made timely  consistent with our status in mci s filing as a key service provider or utility to mci 
see long distance services overview for a discussion of the settlement of the uncollected amounts due from mci 
a migration of mci s traffic off our network without it being replaced by other common carriers that interconnect with our network could have a materially adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
dividends accrued on our series b preferred stock are payable in cash at the semi annual payment dates of april and october of each year 
we paid dividends of  and  on april  and october   respectively 
redemption is required on april  our next series b preferred stock dividend is due april  in october   shares of our series b preferred stock was converted to approximately  shares of our class a common stock at the stated conversion price of per share 
in january an additional  shares of our series b preferred stock was converted to  shares of our class a common stock at the stated conversion price of per share 
the conversions will reduce our future semi annual cash dividends 
dividends accrued on our series c preferred stock are payable quarterly in cash 
our next series c preferred stock dividend of approximately  is due march  we may redeem the series c preferred stock at any time in whole but not in part 
mandatory redemption is required at any time after june  at the option of holders of of the outstanding shares of the series c preferred stock 
the redemption price is  per share plus the amount of all accrued and unpaid dividends  whether earned or declared  through the redemption date 
the long distance  local access  cable  internet and wireless services industries continue to experience substantial competition  regulatory uncertainty  and continuing technological changes 
our future results of operations will be affected by our ability to react to changes in the competitive and regulatory environment and by our ability to fund and implement new or enhanced technologies 
we are unable to determine how competition  economic conditions  and regulatory and technological changes will affect our ability to obtain financing 
the telecommunications industry in general has been depressed due to high levels of competition in the long distance market resulting in pressures to reduce prices  an oversupply of long haul capacity  excessive debt loads  several high profile company failures and potentially fraudulent accounting practices by some companies 
our ability to obtain new debt under acceptable terms and conditions in the future may be diminished as a result 
we believe that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements  fixed charges and preferred stock dividends through our cash flows from operating activities  existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  credit facilities  and other external financing and equity sources 
should cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities  capital expenditures will likely be reduced 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  which are integral to understanding reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with the company s audit committee 
those policies considered to be critical accounting policies for the year ended december  are described below 
o we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  financial health of specific customers  and our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if their financial condition improves or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings  allowances may be reduced 
such allowance changes could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
o we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas goodwill and indefinite lived assets such as our cable segment franchise agreements are no longer amortized but are subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of the applicability of quoted market prices in active markets and  if quoted market prices are not available and or are not applicable  how the acquired asset will perform in the future using a discounted cash flow analysis 
estimated cash flows may extend beyond ten years and  by their nature  are difficult to determine over an extended timeframe 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures and technology  and changes in discount rates  performance compared to peers  material and ongoing negative economic trends  and specific industry or market sector conditions 
in determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates  we review historical performance of the underlying asset or similar assets in an effort to improve assumptions utilized in our estimates 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other intangibles  we may consider other information to validate the reasonableness of our valuations including third party assessments 
these evaluations could result in a change in useful lives in future periods and could result in write down of the value of intangible assets 
because of the significance of the identified intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated balance sheet  the annual impairment analysis will be critical 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
refer to note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding intangible assets 
o we estimate unbilled long distance segment cost of sales and services based upon minutes of use carried through our network and established rates 
we estimate unbilled costs for new circuits and services  and when network changes occur that result in traffic routing changes or a change in carriers 
carriers that provide service to us regularly change their networks which can lead to new  revised or corrected billings 
such estimates are revised or removed when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
revisions to previous estimates could either increase or decrease costs in the year in which the estimate is revised which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
o our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to  and that expire from to pre acquisition income tax net operating losses associated with acquired companies are subject to additional deductibility limits 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets 
in conjunction with certain acquisitions  we determined that approximately million of the acquired net operating losses would not be utilized for income tax purposes  and elected with our december  income tax returns to forego utilization of such acquired losses 
deferred tax assets were not recorded associated with the foregone losses and  accordingly  no valuation allowance was provided 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of december  based on management s belief that future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
polices related to revenue recognition and financial instruments require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
certain of these matters  including but not limited to the requirement to account for the market value of stock options as compensation expense  are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standards setters and regulators 
although no specific conclusions reached by these standard setters appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies  outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence 
a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january we will be required to apply fin r to variable interests in variable interest entities vies created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and non controlling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the vie 
at december   we do not have vies 
we will adopt this statement january  and do not expect it to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
geographic concentration and the alaska economy we offer voice and data telecommunication and video services to customers primarily throughout alaska 
because of this geographic concentration  growth of our business and of our operations depends upon economic conditions in alaska 
the economy of alaska is dependent upon the natural resource industries  and in particular oil production  as well as investment earnings  tourism  government  and united states military spending 
any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on us 
all of the federal funding and the majority of investment revenues are dedicated for specific purposes  leaving oil revenues as the primary source of general operating revenues 
in fiscal the state s actual results indicate that alaska s oil revenues  federal funding and investment revenues supplied  and  respectively  of the state s total revenues 
in fiscal state economists forecast that alaska s oil revenues  federal funding and investment revenues will supply  and  respectively  of the state s total projected revenues 
the volume of oil transported by the transalaska oil pipeline system over the past years has been as high as million barrels per day in fiscal production has been declining over the last several years with an average of million barrels produced per day in fiscal the state forecasts the production rate to decline from million barrels produced per day in fiscal to million barrels produced per day in fiscal the state reports that its forecast has been adjusted since the last forecast reported in april due to the reexamination of field reservoir performance and potential 
market prices for north slope oil averaged in fiscal and are forecasted to average in fiscal the closing price per barrel was on february  to the extent that actual oil prices vary materially from the state s projected prices the state s projected revenues and deficits will change 
every change in the price per barrel of oil is forecasted to result in a to million change in the state s fiscal revenue 
the production policy of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and its ability to continue to act in concert represents a key uncertainty in the state s revenue forecast 
the state of alaska maintains the constitutional budget reserve fund that is intended to fund budgetary shortfalls 
if the state s current projections are realized  the constitutional budget reserve fund will be depleted in the date the constitutional budget reserve fund is depleted is highly influenced by the price of oil 
if the fund is depleted  aggressive state action will be necessary to increase revenues and reduce spending in order to balance the budget 
the governor of the state of alaska and the alaska legislature continue to pursue cost cutting and revenue enhancing measures 
should new oil discoveries or developments not materialize or the price of oil become depressed  the long term trend of continued decline in oil production from the prudhoe bay area is inevitable with a corresponding adverse impact on the economy of the state  in general  and on demand for telecommunications and cable television services  and  therefore  on us  in particular 
periodically there are renewed efforts to allow exploration and development in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr 
the united states energy information agency estimates it could take nine years to begin oil field drilling after approval of anwr exploration 
deployment of a natural gas pipeline from the state of alaska s north slope to the lower states has been proposed to supplement natural gas supplies 
a competing natural gas pipeline through canada has also been proposed 
the economic viability of a natural gas pipeline depends upon the price of and demand for natural gas 
either project could have a positive impact on the state of alaska s revenues and the alaska economy 
in january  two competing groups submitted applications to the state of alaska to negotiate tax and other financial terms for the construction of a natural gas pipeline 
the governor of the state of alaska and certain natural gas transportation companies continue to support a natural gas pipeline from alaska s north slope by trying to reduce the project s costs and by advocating for federal tax incentives to further reduce the project s costs 
development of the ballistic missile defense system project may have a significant impact on alaskan telecommunication requirements and the alaska economy 
the proposed system would be a fixed  land based  non nuclear missile defense system with a land and space based detection system capable of responding to limited strategic ballistic missile threats to the united states 
the preferred alternative is deployment of a system with up to ground based interceptor silos and battle management command and control facilities at fort greely  alaska 
the united states army corps of engineers awarded a construction contract in for test bed facilities 
the contract is reported to contain basic requirements and various options that could amount to million in construction  or possibly more  if all items are executed 
site preparation has been underway at fort greely since august of and construction began on the fort greely test bed shortly after the june  groundbreaking 
the test bed is due to be operational by september   though it may be operational in the summer of in the alaska legislature passed and the governor signed legislation that extended the life of the rca until tourism  air cargo  and service sectors have helped offset the prevailing pattern of oil industry downsizing that has occurred during much of the last several years 
we have  since our entry into the telecommunication marketplace  aggressively marketed our services to seek a larger share of the available market 
the customer base in alaska is limited  however  with a population of approximately  people 
the state of alaska s population is distributed as follows o are located in the municipality of anchorage  o are located in the fairbanks north star borough  o are located in the matanuska susitna borough  o are located in the city and borough of juneau  and o the remaining are located in other communities across the state of alaska 
no assurance can be given that the driving forces in the alaska economy  and in particular  oil production  will continue at appropriate levels to provide an environment for expanded economic activity 
no assurance can be given that oil companies doing business in alaska will be successful in discovering new fields or further developing existing fields which are economic to develop and produce oil with access to the pipeline or other means of transport to market  even with a reduced level of royalties 
we are not able to predict the effect of changes in the price and production volumes of north slope oil on alaska s economy or on us 
seasonality long distance revenues primarily those derived from our other common carrier customers have historically been highest in the summer months because of temporary population increases attributable to tourism and increased seasonal economic activity such as construction  commercial fishing  and oil and gas activities 
cable television revenues  on the other hand  are higher in the winter months because consumers spend more time at home and tend to watch more television during these months 
local access and internet services do not exhibit significant seasonality 
our ability to implement construction projects is also hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures  snow and short daylight hours
