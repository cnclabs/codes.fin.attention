executive overview the company provides services and equipment to the global offshore energy industry through the operation of a diversified fleet of marine service vessels 
revenues  net earnings and cash flows from operations are dependent upon the activity level of the vessel fleet that is ultimately dependent upon oil and natural gas prices that  in turn  are determined by the supply demand relationship for oil and natural gas 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
fiscal was a notable year for vessel construction deliveries and vessel purchase activities  which has allowed the company to expand its deepwater vessel operations and begin replacement of its core vessel fleet 
the company took delivery of newly built vessels and purchased vessels during fiscal to date  the company has financed all of its vessel commitment programs from current cash balances  operating cash flow  million senior unsecured notes and its revolving credit facility 
fiscal domestic operations faced a continued challenging environment in the us gulf of mexico with the prolonged weakness in the offshore drilling market for natural gas 
an increase in the number of vessels operating in the gulf helped to increase domestic revenues as compared to fiscal  but lower utilization and higher depreciation expense increased the company s us based operating loss by approximately compared to fiscal the depressed demand for our gulf of mexico supply vessel fleet resulted in the company cold stacking approximately of its domestic supply vessel fleet 
the majority of the vessels require a drydock before the vessels can return to service should an uptick in the domestic market occur 
management reviewed the cold stacked vessels and determined that vessels would not likely return to active service due to their age  outdated specifications and significant cost to repair and consequently determined that the carrying value of these vessels exceeded their estimated fair values 
in march  the company recorded a non cash asset impairment charge of million million after tax  or 
per share relating to these older gulf of mexico supply vessels 
a full discussion of the 
table of contents impairment of long lived assets is disclosed in impairment of long lived assets section of item and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s international results of operations are primarily dependent on the demand and supply relationship for crude oil 
although the industry overall is benefiting from high crude oil prices and a strong demand for oil  the company s international based vessel revenues declined a modest due to lower utilization in the west african and southeast asian markets because of decreased drilling activity 
as a result of generating lower revenues the company s international based operating profit declined from fiscal levels 
vessel construction programs and acquisitions on january   the company entered into agreements with a shipyard in china for the construction of five large anchor handling towing supply vessels which are capable of working in most deepwater markets of the world 
scheduled deliveries for the five vessels have been delayed 
the company has been advised by the shipbuilder to expect the first vessel to be delivered to the market in june while the remaining four vessels are expected to be delivered throughout fiscal the total estimated cost for the vessels is approximately million  which includes shipyard commitments and other incidental costs such as spare parts  management and supervision  and outfitting costs 
the company has fixed cost contracts supported by performance bonds with the shipyard and does not anticipate any cost overruns related to these vessels 
as of march   million has been expended on the vessels 
the company is also constructing nine anchor handling towing supply vessels varying in size from  brake horsepower bhp to  bhp 
four international shipyards will each construct two vessels and a fifth shipyard will construct one vessel 
scheduled delivery of the nine vessels is expected to begin in may with the last vessel delivered in november as of march   million has been expended on the vessels of the total commitment cost 
as of march   the company committed to the purchase of one anchor handling towing supply vessel for a total cost of million 
the company will take possession of the vessel in april no monies were expended on the vessel as of march  the company is also committed to the construction of one foot next generation supply vessel for approximately million and four foot  state of the art  fast  crew supply boats that blend the speed of a crewboat with the capabilities of a supply vessel for an approximate total cost of million 
the four crewboat vessels are being constructed by one us shipyard while a different us shipyard is constructing the supply vessel 
the vessels are scheduled for delivery between april and may as of march   million has been expended on the five vessels

table of contents total million of capital commitments for vessels currently under construction the company has expended million as of march  while the company has not formally committed to any future new build vessel contracts at the present time  other than what has been discussed above and barring any future acquisitions of existing companies or newly constructed equipment  the company anticipates over the next several years continuing its vessel building program in order to replace its aging vessels 
the majority of the company s supply and towing supply vessels were constructed between and as such  most of this vessel class exceeds years of age and will ultimately need to be replaced 
in addition to age  market conditions will also help determine when a vessel is no longer economically viable 
the company anticipates using future operating cash flows and borrowing capacities to fund significant capital expenditures over the next several years 
on april   the company paid million in cash to ensco international incorporated to purchase its vessel gulf of mexico based marine fleet 
the mix of vessels the company acquired consists of five anchor handling towing supply vessels  six stretched foot platform supply vessels and supply vessels 
in conjunction with this acquisition  it was agreed that  for a period of two years and subject to satisfactory performance  the company would provide to ensco all of its discretionary vessel requirements in the gulf of mexico 
the day rates to be charged under the arrangement are based upon predetermined pricing criteria 
the acquisition enhances the competitive posture of the company in providing anchor handling and towing supply services in the gulf of mexico 
during fiscal  the company took delivery of two large  platform supply vessels one constructed by a brazilian shipyard and other by a shipyard in the far east and nine next generation supply vessels  ranging in size from foot to foot  for approximately million 
the company s shipyard  quality shipyard  llc  constructed three of the next generation supply vessels and two other us shipyards constructed the remaining six vessels 
the nine vessels are intermediate in size and are technically capable of working in certain deepwater markets  however  the vessels were constructed in order to replace older supply vessels 
also during fiscal  the company purchased two  bhp anchor handling towing supply vessel for approximately million  one offshore tug for approximately million and took delivery of three water jet crewboats that were constructed in holland for approximately million 
during fiscal  the company took delivery of seven large platform supply vessels that were delivered to the market for an approximate total cost of million 
three of the platform supply vessels were constructed at quality shipyards  llc and were built to full jones act compliance 
a shipyard in singapore constructed two of the large platform supply vessels while a norwegian shipyard and a brazilian shipyard each constructed one large platform supply vessel 
in addition  during fiscal  the company took delivery of three foot next generation platform supply vessels for approximately million 
in fiscal  the company took delivery of one large platform supply vessel built by quality shipyards  llc for an approximate cost of million and took delivery of three large platform supply vessels built in norway for a total cost of million 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company finalized the cash purchase of two anchor handling towing supply vessels for million 
the three large platform supply vessels and two anchor handling towing supply vessels are specifically designed and equipped for deepwater work 
throughout fiscal the company constructed and took delivery of four large traditional crewboats that were built at us shipyards for approximately million 
during fiscal  the company announced that it was expanding its crewboat fleet 
the company purchased existing crewboats and assumed four new build contracts from crewboats  inc  a privately held  leading independent provider of crewboat services in the gulf of mexico  for approximately million 
two of the new build vessels were delivered to the market during fiscal for an approximate total cost of million while the remaining two crewboats were delivered during the first and second quarter of fiscal for an approximate cost of million 
also in fiscal  the company committed million for the construction of four foot  state of the art  fast  crew supply boats that blend the speed of a crewboat with the capabilities of a supply vessel 
the first foot crewboat was delivered to the market during the fourth quarter of fiscal for an 
table of contents approximate total cost of million while the three remaining crewboats were delivered during the first and second quarters of fiscal for an approximate cost of million 
all four vessels were constructed at a us shipyard that is currently constructing an additional four foot  fast  crew supply boats discussed above

the company financed the sale of all three crewboats 
under the terms of the repayment agreement  the loan is payable in equal installments  which will end in december  plus interest at day libor plus adjusted quarterly 
the transaction resulted in a fiscal gain on sale of assets of 
million and increased the investments in  at equity  and advances to unconsolidated companies account by million 
the company also sold one deepwater platform supply vessel and one crewboat to the same owned unconsolidated joint venture for million during fiscal the company financed the million sale of the deepwater vessel  while the joint venture paid million cash for the crewboat 
the repayment agreement calls for the loan to be payable in equal installments  which will end in april  plus interest at day libor plus adjusted quarterly 
the transactions resulted in a fiscal gain on sale of assets of million and increased the investments in  at equity  and advances to unconsolidated companies account by million 
during fiscal  the company sold its holding in its consolidated marine joint venture  maritide offshore oil services company sae  for approximately million  resulting in a million gain 
as a result of the sale  the international towing supply supply vessel count decreased by five vessels 
while the company has been building or acquiring new vessels during the last few years  it also has sold and or scrapped vessels between april and march the mix of vessels disposed of includes towing supply supply vessels  crew utility vessels  offshore tugs and other vessels  primarily barges 
vessels withdrawn from service the company withdraws from active service older  little used vessels at which time the vessels are removed from the utilization statistics 
vessel utilization rates are a function of vessel days worked and vessel days available for active vessels only 
the company did not withdraw any vessel from active service during fiscal or during fiscal  the company withdrew vessels  primarily towing supply supply vessels  from active service 
vessels that are withdrawn from active service are intended to be sold 
the company continues to dispose of its older vessels out of the active fleet and the withdrawn fleet that are not marketable due to obsolescence or are economically prohibitive to operate due to high repair costs 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets despite attractive domestic oil and gas commodity pricing for an extended period of time  numerous marine drilling rigs have exited the gulf of mexico 
these departures  combined with the low activity levels of traditional gulf of mexico operators  have left the active offshore rig count at its lowest level in ten years 
faced with this realization  by late fiscal the company concluded that extrinsic evidence was mounting that the current low activity levels in the gulf of mexico could persist for some time 
as a result  management performed a review of the recoverability of the values of its gulf of mexico operating assets and recorded a non cash asset impairment charge of million million after tax  or 
per share relating to older gulf of mexico supply vessels 
as a result of the prolonged weakness in the gulf of mexico drilling market  these vessels have been cold stacked for the last few years 
due to these vessels average age years  their outdated specifications low horsepower and cargo capacities relative to competing equipment  the significant costs to repair and return these vessels to service average approximately  per vessel and the anticipation of low customer demand for these vessels in the future  the company has concluded it is unlikely these vessels will ever return to active service 
based on this determination  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the asset impairment charge noted above was taken to adjust the carrying value of these assets to fair market value as of march  the fair market value of these vessels was determined based upon management s estimate of liquidation values that could be realized in sales to unrelated purchasers and included an assumption that a significant number of the vessels as much as may have to be scrapped 
due to their outdated specifications and the depressed market conditions in the gulf of mexico  disposal of these assets may take an extended period of time 
general market conditions and results of operations offshore service vessels provide a diverse range of services and equipment to the energy industry 
fleet size  utilization and vessel day rates primarily determine the amount of revenues and operating profit because operating costs and depreciation do not change proportionally when revenue changes 
operating costs primarily consist of crew costs  repair and maintenance  insurance  fuel  lube oil and supplies 
fleet size and utilization are the major factors that affect crew costs 
the timing and amount of repair and maintenance costs are influenced by customer demands  vessel age and scheduled drydockings to satisfy safety and inspection requirements mandated by regulatory agencies 
whenever possible  vessel drydockings are done during seasonally slow periods to minimize any impact on vessel operations and are only done if economically justified  given the vessel s age and physical condition 
the following table compares revenues and operating expenses excluding general and administrative expenses and depreciation expense for the company s vessel fleet for the years ended march vessel revenues and operating costs relate to vessels owned and operated by the company  while other marine services relate to third party activities of the company s shipyards  brokered vessels and other miscellaneous marine related activities

the company will recognize the amounts as revenue as cash is collected or at such time as the uncertainty has been resolved 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal fiscal s results of operations were lower than the previous fiscal year due to a weak us gulf of mexico natural gas drilling market and to lower utilization in certain international markets  particularly west africa and southeast asia 
the prolonged weakness in the natural gas drilling market in the gulf of mexico continues to impact the company s domestic results of operations 
with the addition of several new build vessels delivered to the domestic fleet in the last year and the additional vessels acquired from ensco on april   domestic based vessel revenues increased from prior year levels  but utilization rates  especially for the company s towing supply supply vessels  remain at a depressed level 
strong natural gas commodity prices and tight inventory levels for the resource for the majority of fiscal did not stimulate gas drilling in the gulf of mexico market 
the reasons for the continuing low level of offshore drilling and exploration activity are not fully known 
market analysts expect that natural gas commodity prices will increase during calendar year due to the global economic recovery that they believe is underway 
industry pundits have predicted for some time that commodity prices for the resource will be sustainable at the higher level  which historically has been a positive indicator for increased drilling activity 
whether sustained higher natural gas prices will result in increased drilling levels or demand for the company s vessels in the gulf of mexico during the foreseeable future is uncertain 
although the international offshore marine service industry overall is benefiting from high crude oil prices and a strong worldwide consumer demand for oil  the company s international results of operations for fiscal have been negatively affected by lower utilization rates  particularly in the west african and southeast asian markets because of decreased drilling activity 
industry analysts forecast that demand for crude oil will likely remain strong throughout calendar as a result of the global economic recovery that is underway and expect future crude oil prices to remain at highly attractive levels due to high consumer demand and the recently announced reduction in crude oil production output by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
international capital expenditures by the exploration and production companies in calendar year are estimated to increase by approximately over calendar year levels 
domestic based vessel revenues increased approximately as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increased number of company vessels operating in the domestic market resulting from the addition of several new build vessels during fiscal and the acquisition of the ensco vessels on april  although the company s seven deepwater class of vessels operating in the gulf contributed approximately of the revenue growth for fiscal as compared to fiscal  it is the company s towing supply supply vessel class that is the major income producing vessel class in the domestic market 
the higher number of towing supply supply vessels operating in the domestic market helped generate approximately higher revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal utilization rates for the towing 
table of contents supply supply vessels were comparable to fiscal utilization  however  average day rates declined approximately during fiscal the company s average day rates still remain at high levels as compared to the average day rates experienced during the last industry downturn 
utilization rates in the us gulf of mexico  however  still remain at the lowest level the company has experienced in over a decade due in part to management s strategic decision to maintain higher average day rates at the expense of lower utilization and in part to a lower demand for vessels in the gulf of mexico 
due to the lack of demand at the higher day rate level  the company currently has cold stacked towing supply supply vessels  all but one vessel requires a drydock before returning to service 
faced with the realization that the current low level of vessel demand could persist for some time  management performed a review of the recoverability of the values of its gulf of mexico operating assets and determined that it is unlikely that older supply vessels will ever return to active service due to the vessels average age  their outdated specifications relative to competing equipment and significant costs to repair and return these vessels to service and consequently recorded a non cash asset impairment charge of million million after tax  or 
per share in march a full discussion of the impairment of long lived assets is disclosed in impairment of long lived assets section of item and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
also  the company s offshore tugs operating in the gulf experienced a increase in revenues during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to higher utilization as a result of an increase in construction activity  ocean barge towing and an increase in rig moving for ensco 
in conjunction with the acquisition of ensco vessels  it was agreed that  for a period of two years and subject to satisfactory performance  the company would provide to ensco all of their discretionary vessel requirements in the gulf of mexico 
international based vessel revenues declined a modest as compared to fiscal due to lower utilization rates in certain international markets 
average day rates for the current fiscal year increased for the entire international based fleet but were insufficient to mitigate the negative effect lower utilization had on revenues 
in november of the company purchased seven deepwater vessels that were fulfilling bareboat contractual obligations at the time of purchase 
only one of the original seven bareboat contractual obligations exists at present as six of the original bareboat charters expired at various times during fiscal the bareboat charter agreement on the remaining vessel will expire in the first quarter of fiscal in a bareboat charter agreement  the bareboat charterer leases a vessel for a pre arranged fee and is able to market the vessel and is also responsible for providing the crew and all other operating costs related to the vessel 
for the vessel that the company has under bareboat contract  only revenue and depreciation expense are recorded related to the vessel s activity 
as the company incurs no operating costs related to the vessels  the related bareboat day rates are less than comparable vessels operating under normal charter hire arrangements 
for fiscal year ended march   the bareboat chartered deepwater vessels experienced utilization and an average day rate of approximately  the international based deepwater vessel fleet  excluding the bareboat chartered vessels discussed above  experienced approximately utilization and an average day rate of approximately  for the fiscal year ended march  other marine service revenues increased million  or approximately as compared to fiscal the company s shipyard  quality shipyards  llc generated million of the increase 
quality shipyards  llc performed more third party vessel construction  repair and refurbishments during fiscal than in prior two fiscal years 
for the past three fiscal years prior to fiscal the shipyard was constructing vessels for tidewater and did not have much excess capacity for third party construction jobs during those years 
us based operating losses increased approximately million as compared to fiscal due to higher depreciation expense resulting from an increase in the number of vessels operating in the domestic market and due to higher vessel operating costs  primarily crew costs despite implementing significant cost cutting measures that resulted in the reduction of us shore based and fleet personnel during the latter part of the second quarter of fiscal  repair and maintenance  and fuel  lube and supplies 
the higher vessel operating costs pertain primarily to the new vessels added to the domestic fleet during fiscal contributing to fiscal domestic operating losses is the cost associated with the cold stacked supply vessels  which contributed approximately million of costs million of depreciation expense and million of vessel operating costs to the domestic results of operations 
international based vessel operating profit decreased approximately as compared to fiscal due to 
table of contents earning lower revenues resulting from reduced vessel utilization and due to higher vessel operating costs driven primarily by greater crew costs related to the new vessels added to the fleet since last year  higher repair and maintenance costs  and due to increases in fuel  lube and supply costs resulting from furnishing the new vessels and mobilizing them to their areas of operations 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal fiscal results of operations decreased as compared to fiscal due to a weak natural gas market in the us gulf of mexico 
the company s fiscal domestic results of operations were negatively affected by the retrenchment in development and capital expenditures in the us gulf of mexico that began during fiscal the high offshore rig fleet utilization rates that were achieved during fiscal began to steadily decrease during the second quarter of fiscal and continued to decrease throughout the remainder of fiscal on the news that inventory levels for natural gas were increasing as a result of unseasonably moderate weather and economic slowdowns in the united states and globally 
the company s vessel utilization rates in the us gulf of mexico steadily decreased to levels not experienced in well over a decade 
market conditions improved during fiscal as natural gas supplies declined due to a general reduction in drilling activity  drilling interruptions caused by tropical storm isidore and hurricane lili in the gulf of mexico  and because of increased demand due to severe winter weather 
all three factors contributed to higher natural gas prices  but did not result in increased gas drilling in the gulf of mexico market 
the reasons for the low level of drilling and exploration activity are still not fully known  however  the company did believe that general uncertain economic conditions and concerns about the stability of natural gas prices were significant contributing factors 
the company s fiscal international results of operations benefited from attractive crude oil commodity prices and high consumer demand for crude oil 
world crude oil commodity prices strengthen throughout fiscal as opec adjusted its crude oil production levels and successfully negotiated with non opec oil producing countries to adjust their respective production levels in order to help stabilize and maintain commodity prices at levels that would sustain growth 
the company s international vessel demand is primarily driven by crude oil production and during fiscal average day rates and utilization for the international vessel fleet remained relatively stable although political unrest in venezuela during the latter part of fiscal did have a slight negative impact on revenues 
the us occupation and reconstruction of iraq in the middle east did not have a significant impact on the company s revenues 
domestic based vessel revenues decreased as compared to fiscal due to lower utilization and average day rates 
the company s average day rates have not deteriorated to the low levels experienced during the last industry downturn due to management s strategic decision to attempt to maintain high day rates at the expense of lower utilization 
as a result of this decision  the vessel utilization rates in the us gulf of mexico are the lowest the company has experienced in over a decade 
utilization and average day rates for the towing supply supply vessels  the company s major income producing vessel class in the domestic market  decreased approximately and  respectively as compared to fiscal at march   the towing supply supply vessels experienced approximately utilization and average day rates of approximately  international based vessel revenues increased a modest as compared to fiscal due to higher average day rates and an increase in the number of active vessels operating internationally 
a two month long general strike that shut down oil production in venezuela that began in early december and lasted through early february which was led by the workers of the venezuelan government owned company pdvsa had a slight negative impact on international revenues 
in december  the company had vessels contracted with pdvsa 
the majority of the vessels ceased operations during the work stoppage  but continued to earn revenue on a per day basis as stipulated in the charter hire agreements or as agreed to by pdvsa representatives 
in november  the company purchased seven deepwater vessels that are currently fulfilling bareboat contractual obligations that existed at the time the vessels were purchased 
the bareboat charter agreements on six of the vessels will expire at various times over the next year  although in one of the agreements  the charter party has the option to extend the contract for an additional two years 
the remaining vessel has a contractual obligation that expires within four years 
in a bareboat charter agreement  the bareboat charterer leases a vessel for a pre arranged fee and is able to market the vessel

for the vessels that the company has under bareboat contracts  only revenue and depreciation expense are recorded related to the vessels activity 
as the company incurs no operating costs related to the vessels  the related bareboat day rates are less than comparable vessels operating under normal charter hire arrangements 
for fiscal year ended march   the seven bareboat chartered deepwater vessels experienced utilization and average day rates of approximately  the international based deepwater vessel fleet  excluding the bareboat chartered vessels discussed above  experienced approximately utilization and average day rates of approximately  for the fiscal year ended march operating profit for fiscal decreased as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of decreases in domestic based vessel revenues 
domestic operating profit decreased most dramatically due to a weak natural gas market in the us gulf of mexico 
domestic based operating costs decreased during fiscal due to general cost cutting measures that were implemented which resulted in a reduction of domestic crew and a decrease in the number of vessel drydockings performed 
in addition  the reduction in business activity reduced fuel  lube and supplies costs and other vessel operating cost 
during fiscal  international based operating profit decreased as compared to fiscal due to a slight decrease in utilization  the negative effects of the two month long work stoppage in venezuelan operations  and also due to a slight increase in international operating costs  primarily crew costs and fuel  lube and supply costs 
vessel class statistics vessel utilization is determined primarily by market conditions and to a lesser extent by drydocking requirements 
vessel day rates are determined by the demand created through the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy companies relative to the supply of offshore service vessels 
suitability of equipment and the degree of service provided also influence vessel day rates 
vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel is available to work in the reporting period 
average day rates are calculated by dividing the revenue a vessel earns during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel worked in the reporting period 
vessel utilization and average day rates are calculated on active vessels only and  as such  do not include vessel withdrawn from active service or joint venture vessels

sale proceeds were offset by additions to properties and equipment totaling million which was comprised of million for the construction of offshore marine vessels and the acquisition of two deepwater anchor handling towing supply vessels and large crewboats  and million in capitalized repairs and maintenance 
additions to properties and equipment were higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily because of the continuation in capital spending for various vessel construction programs and due to the purchase of several crewboat vessels

interest costs capitalized during fiscal  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
total interest and debt costs incurred in fiscal were considerably higher than the previous two fiscal years as a result of increased debt levels 
the relative portion of interest cost capitalized during fiscal was less than prior years due to the reduced level of investments in the company s new construction program during the current fiscal year 

table of contents other liquidity matters while the company has not formally committed to any future new build vessel contracts at the present time  other than what has been discussed in the vessel construction programs and acquisitions section of item and barring any future acquisitions of existing companies or newly constructed equipment  the company anticipates over the next several years continuing its vessel building program in order to replace its aging vessels 
the majority of the company s supply and towing supply vessels were constructed between and as such  most of this vessel class exceeds years of age and will ultimately need to be replaced 
in addition to age  market conditions will also help determine when a vessel is no longer economically viable 
the company anticipates using future operating cash flows and borrowing capacities to fund significant capital expenditures over the next several years 
at the conclusion of its examination of the company s income tax returns covering fiscal years and  the internal revenue service irs issued an examination report challenging the depreciation methods historically utilized by the company and the entire offshore marine support industry 
the irs position could have resulted in additional income tax due approximating million for the years under review 
such additional taxes  if due  would have resulted in a reclassification of a previously recorded noncurrent deferred income tax liability to a current tax payable 
subsequent to the issuance of the examination report the irs has verbally informed the company that it intends to withdraw its original challenge to the company s depreciation methods 
the company is awaiting receipt of the amended examination report reflecting that change of position 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s consolidated contractual obligations as of march  and the effect such obligations  inclusive of interest costs  are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total less than one year years years more than years long term debt capital leases operating leases a vessel construction obligations total a operating leases include only non cancelable lease obligations greater than one year 
off balance sheet arrangements the company currently does not utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance its liquidity and capital resource positions  or for any other purpose 
any future transactions involving off balance sheet arrangements would be analyzed and disclosed by the company s management 
certain known trends  events  uncertainties and risk factors the company operates in a business environment that has many risks 
listed below are some of the more critical risk factors that affect the company and the offshore marine service industry and should be considered when evaluating any forward looking statement 
the effect of any one risk factor or a combination of several risk factors could materially affect the company s results of operations and financial condition and the accuracy of any forward looking statement made in this form k 
oil and gas prices are highly volatile 
commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas are highly volatile 
prices are extremely sensitive to the supply demand relationship for the respective natural 
table of contents resources 
high demand for crude oil and natural gas and or low inventory levels for the resources as well as any perceptions about future supply interruptions can cause commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas to rise  while generally  low demand for natural resources and or increases in crude oil and natural gas supplies cause commodity prices for the respective natural resources to decrease 
factors that affect the supply of crude oil and natural gas include but are not limited to the following the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec ability to control crude oil production levels and pricing  as well as  the level of production by non opec countries  political and economic uncertainties  advances in exploration and development technology  worldwide demand for natural resources  and governmental restrictions placed on exploration and production of natural resources 
changes in the level of capital spending by our customers 
the company s principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  development and production companies 
the company s results of operations are highly dependent on the level of capital spending by the energy industry 
the energy industry s level of capital spending is substantially related to the prevailing commodity price of natural gas and crude oil 
during periods of low commodity prices  the company s customers generally reduce their capital spending budgets for offshore drilling  exploration and development 
historically  strong fundamentals such as high commodity prices for natural gas and crude oil  tight inventory levels for the resources along with strong consumer demand have been positive indicators for increases in capital spending by the company s customers 
the us natural gas market has experienced strong fundamentals for well over a year now  however  these positive indicators have not stimulated the company s customers operating in the u 
s 
gulf of mexico to increase their capital spending 
the offshore marine service industry is highly competitive 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
competitive factors include price and quality of service by vessel operators and the quality and availability of vessels 
decreases in the level of offshore drilling and development activity by the energy industry generally negatively affect the demand for the company s vessels thereby exerting downward pressure on day rates 
extended periods of low vessel demand and or low day rates will reduce the company s revenues 
also  excess marine service capacity exerts downward pressure on day rates 
excess capacity can occur when newly constructed vessels enter the market and when vessels are mobilized between market areas 
while the company has committed to the construction of several vessels  it has also sold and or scrapped a significant number of vessels over the last few years 
a discussion about the company s new vessel construction programs appears in the vessel construction programs and acquisitions section of item failure to attract and retain key management and technical personnel 
the company s success depends upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key management and technical personnel  particularly the company s area managers and fleet personnel  and our ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of a number of the company s executive officers  area managers  fleet personnel or other key employees  or our ability to recruit replacements for such personnel or to otherwise attract  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel could harm the company 
the company currently does not carry key employee life insurance payable to the company with respect to any of its management employees 
risks associated with operating internationally 
for the fiscal years ended march   and    and  respectively  of the company s total revenues were generated by international operations 
the company s international marine vessel operations are vulnerable to the usual risks inherent in doing business in countries other than the united states 
such risks include political and economic instability  possible vessel seizures or nationalization of assets and other governmental actions  the ability to recruit and retain management of overseas operations  currency fluctuations and revaluations  and import export restrictions  all of which are beyond the control of the company 
the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war  or hostility  have significantly increased the risk of political  economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates 
it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of us owned companies such as ours 
to date  the company has not experienced any property losses or material 
table of contents adverse effects on its results of operations and financial condition as a result of terrorism  political instability or war 
in addition to the foregoing general risks inherent with operating internationally  the company currently bears specific risks associated with its offshore operations in the middle east and southeast asia 
the potential for economic  political and social instability has been exacerbated in the middle east by the us occupation and reconstruction in iraq and the continuing military presence in afghanistan 
although terrorism and war developments have not adversely affected the company s operations in the middle east  the company  like other american companies engaged in business in the region  could be subject to the interruption of its operations  or other adverse developments 
at this time  it is not possible to assess at what time in the future political and social conditions in this region will return to normal 
political and social unrest continues to be present in indonesia 
much of this turmoil can be traced to separatist groups opposing indonesian governmental rule and also to religious turmoil and regional reaction to the united states military and political response to the terrorist attacks on the united states on september  although this reaction has not been destabilizing to the company  there continues to be a higher than normal level of unrest throughout the region 
at present  the company believes the risks of operating internationally to be within acceptable limits and  in view of the mobile nature of the company s principal revenue producing assets  does not consider them to constitute a factor materially adverse to the conduct of its international marine vessel operations as a whole 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the recorded values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the revenues recognized and expenses incurred during the reporting period 
the company s estimates and assumptions affect its recognition of deferred expenses  bad debts  income taxes  the carrying value of its long lived assets and goodwill  and its provision for certain contingencies 
the company evaluates the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions continually based on a combination of historical information and other information that comes to its attention that may vary its outlook for the future 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
management suggests that the company s summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the company s consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition 
the company s primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts of its vessels on a rate per day of service basis 
these time charter contracts are generally either on a term basis average three months to two years or on a spot basis 
the base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate  provided  however  that term contracts at times include escalation clauses to recover increases in specific costs 
a spot contract is a short term agreement to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short term job 
spot contract terms generally range from one day to one week 
marine vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
receivables 
in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
the company s principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  development and production companies 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes adequate provisions for doubtful accounts 
the company self insures potential hull damage and personal injury claims that may arise in the normal course of business 
the company is exposed to insurance risks related to the company s 
table of contents reinsurance contracts with various insurance entities 
the reinsurance recoverable amount can vary depending on the size of a loss 
the exact amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
the company estimates the reinsurance recoverable amount it expects to receive and also estimates losses for claims that have occurred but have not been reported or not fully developed 
the company also monitors its reinsurance recoverable balances regularly for possible reinsurance exposure and makes adequate provisions for doubtful reinsurance receivables 
it is the company s opinion that its accounts and reinsurance receivables have no impairment other than that for which provisions have been made 
goodwill 
the company tests goodwill impairment annually at a reporting unit level  as required  using carrying amounts as of december the company considers its reporting units to be its domestic and international operations 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit is determined by discounting the projected future operating cash flows for the remaining average useful life of the assets within the reporting units by the company s related cost of capital 
impairment is deemed to exist if the implied fair value of the reporting unit is less than the respective book value of the reporting unit  and in such case  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the implied fair value of each reporting unit  such as  future expected utilization and average day rates for the vessels  vessel additions and attrition  operating expenses and tax rates 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december   and the test determined there was no goodwill impairment 
at march   the company s goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
interim testing will be performed when events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
examples of events or circumstances that might give rise to interim goodwill impairment testing include significant adverse industry or economic changes  significant business interruption due to political unrest or terrorism  unanticipated competition that has the potential to dramatically reduce the company s earning potential  legal issues  or the loss of key personnel 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
in such evaluation  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset  based upon the company s reasonable estimate of the remaining useful life of the asset  are compared with the amount recorded for the asset to determine if a write down may be required 
the company estimates cash flow based upon historical data adjusted for the company s best estimate of future market performance that is based on industry trends 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the long lived asset is reduced to the estimated fair value of the asset  based upon its estimated future discounted cash flows 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
income taxes 
the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities in the united states and by the respective tax agencies in the countries in which we operate internationally 
the tax audits generally include questions regarding the calculation of taxable income 
audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize such deferred tax assets  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such 
table of contents determination was made 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
drydocking costs 
the company expenses maintenance and repair costs as incurred during the asset s original estimated useful life its original depreciable life 
major repair costs incurred after the original depreciable life that also has the effect of extending the useful life of the asset are capitalized and amortized over months 
major vessel modifications are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the equipment 
the majority of the company s vessels require a drydocking inspection twice in each five year period and the company schedules these drydockings when it is anticipated that the work can be performed 
the company s net earnings can fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing of scheduled drydockings 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and a supplemental executive retirement plan serp covering eligible employees of tidewater inc and participating subsidiaries 
the company also sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan that covers eligible us fleet personnel and eligible employees of the company hired after december  and a post retirement plan for qualified retired employees 
net periodic pension costs and accumulated benefit obligations are determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for pensions  using a number of assumptions including the discount rate  the rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and expected long term return on plan assets 
these assumptions have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
the company s pension cost consists of service costs  interest costs  amortization of prior service costs or benefits  expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the company considers a number of factors in developing its pension assumptions  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term returns on plan assets  plan asset allocations  expected changes in wages and retirement benefits  analyses of current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
changes the accounting guidance for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  could have been classified as either a liability or equity 
sfas no 
now requires those instruments to be classified as liabilities or as assets under some circumstances in the statement of financial position 
sfas no 
also requires the terms of those instruments and any settlement alternatives to be disclosed 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may  otherwise  it is effective for all financial instruments beginning in the second quarter of the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb published a revision to interpretation fin r to clarify certain provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
fin r requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity vie  as defined  when the company will absorb a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the variable interest entity s expected residual returns  or both 
fin r also requires consolidation of existing  non controlled affiliates if the vie is unable to finance its operations without investor support  or where the other investors do not have exposure to the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
fin r applies immediately to a vie created or acquired after january  for a vie acquired before february   fin r applies in the first interim period ending after march  the company completed its assessment of the impact of fin r and concluded that the interpretation did not affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revised statement retains the disclosures required by the original sfas no 
and requires additional disclosures describing the types of plan assets  investment strategy  measurement date  plan obligations  cash flows and components of net periodic benefit cost recognized during interim periods 
the revised statement is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending 
table of contents after december  the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
have been applied in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d  as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
in january  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  which is effective for interim or annual financial statements of fiscal years ending after december  fsp fas permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to either include the effects of the act in its year end disclosures or defer the inclusion of the effect of the act in its disclosures until authoritative guidance is issued or until a significant event occurs that ordinarily would call for re measurement of a plan s assets and obligations 
because authoritative guidance has not been issued and the impact to the plan is presently unknown  the company elected to defer accounting for the effects of the act and  as such  any measures of the postretirement benefit obligation or net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the financial statements or accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the act 
effects of inflation day to day operating costs are generally affected by inflation 
however  because the energy services industry requires specialized goods and services  general economic inflationary trends may not affect the company s operating costs 
the major impact on operating costs is the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy exploration and production companies 
as the spending increases  prices of goods and services used by the energy industry and the energy services industry will increase 
future increases in vessel day rates may shield the company from the inflationary effects on operating costs 
environmental matters during the ordinary course of business the company s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations 
the company attempts to comply with these laws and regulations in order to avoid costly accidents and related environmental damage 
compliance with existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  has not had  nor is expected to have  a material effect on the company 
the company is proactive in establishing policies and operating procedures for safeguarding the environment against any environmentally hazardous material aboard its vessels and at shore base locations 
whenever possible  hazardous materials are maintained or transferred in confined areas to ensure containment if accidents occur 
in addition the company has established operating policies that are intended to increase awareness of actions that may harm the environment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations and exchange rates  equity prices and commodity prices including the correlation among these factors and their volatility 
the company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk and foreign currency fluctuations and exchange risk 
interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  interest income and interest expense 
the company s financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk are its cash equivalents and long term borrowings 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of the cash equivalent investment portfolio  the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investments 
the book value for cash equivalents is considered to be representative of its fair value 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company signed a new million revolving credit agreement which replaced the existing million revolving credit and term loan agreement 
under the new agreement  borrowings bear interest at the company s option  at prime or federal funds rates plus 

table of contents or libor rates plus margins from 
to based on the company s funded debt to total capitalization ratio 
the new revolving credit commitment will expire on april  any borrowings under the agreement are unsecured and the company pays an annual fee of 
on the unused portion of the facility 
at march   the company had million of debt outstanding of which million represents unsecured borrowings from the company s revolving credit facility 
the fair market valued of this debt approximates the carrying value because the borrowings bear interest at variable market rates  which currently range from to percent 
monies were borrowed under the revolving credit facility to help finance the company s new build program previously disclosed 
the majority of interest expense associated with the borrowings is being capitalized 
a one percentage point change in the market interest rate on the million of borrowings from the company s revolving credit facility at march  would change the company s interest costs by 
million annually 
the remaining million represents senior unsecured debt note borrowings that were issued on july  the multiple series of notes with maturities ranging from years to years have an average outstanding life to maturity of years and can be retired prior to maturity without penalty 
the average interest rate on the notes is 
the fair value of this debt at march  approximates its face value 
foreign exchange risk 
the company s financial instruments that can be affected by foreign currency fluctuations and exchange risks consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables and trade payables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company periodically enters into spot and forward derivative financial instruments as a hedge against foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and currency commitments 
spot derivative financial instruments are short term in nature and settle within two business days 
the fair value approximates the carrying value due to the short term nature of this instrument  and as a result  no gains or losses are recognized 
forward derivative financial instruments are generally longer term in nature but generally do not exceed one year 
the accounting for gains or losses on forward contracts is dependent on the nature of the risk being hedged and the effectiveness of the hedge 
the company enters into derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its risk management objectives and does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
the company had no spot contracts outstanding at march   and the company had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at march  and that qualified as a hedge instrument 
at march  the company had five forward currency derivative contracts outstanding totaling million 
for full disclosure on the company s derivative financial instruments see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
because of its significant international operations  the company is exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange risk on all contracts in foreign currencies 
the company does not hedge against any foreign currency rate fluctuations associated with foreign currency contracts that arise in the normal course of business 
to minimize the financial impact of these items the company attempts to contract a majority of its services in united states dollars 
the company continually monitors the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in us dollar
