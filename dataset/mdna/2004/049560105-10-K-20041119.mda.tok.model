item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this section provides management s discussion of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
it includes management s interpretation of our financial results  the factors affecting these results  the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements contained in this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward looking statements made in good faith by the company and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this report  or any other of the company s documents or oral presentations  the words anticipate  believe  expect  estimate  forecast  goal  intend  objective  plan  projection  seek  strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to the company s strategy  operations  markets  services  rates  recovery of costs  availability of gas supply and other factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following adverse weather conditions  such as warmer than normal weather in the company s utility service territories or colder than normal weather that could adversely affect our natural gas marketing activities  regulatory trends and decisions  including deregulation initiatives and the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions  market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity  commodity price volatility and counterparty creditworthiness  national  regional and local economic conditions  the company s ability to continue to access the capital markets  the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and prices of natural gas  including the volatility of natural gas prices  increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy  risks relating to the acquisition of the txu gas operations  including without limitation  the company s increased indebtedness resulting from the acquisition and the successful integration of the txu gas operations  and other uncertainties discussed herein  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  while the company believes these forward looking statements to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized 
further  the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that may affect our future performance our performance in the future will primarily depend on the results of our utility and natural gas marketing operations 
several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance  some of which are described below 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in these forward looking statements 
our operations are weather sensitive 
weather is one of the most significant factors influencing our performance 
our natural gas utility sales volumes and related revenues are correlated with heating requirements that result from cold winter weather 
our agricultural sales volumes are associated with the rainfall levels during the growing season in our west texas irrigation market 
however  weather normalized rates in effect in several of our jurisdictions should 
table of contents mitigate the adverse effects of warmer than normal weather on our utility operating results 
finally  sustained cold weather could adversely affect our natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts 
our operations are subject to regulation which can directly impact our operations 
our natural gas utility business is subject to various regulated returns on its rate base in each of the states in which we operate 
we monitor the allowed rates of return  our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as needed 
in addition  in the normal course of the regulatory environment  assets are placed in service and historical test periods are established before rate cases can be filed 
once rate cases are filed  regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while studying the cases 
because of this process  we must temporarily suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief  which is commonly referred to as regulatory lag 
in addition  our debt and equity financing programs are also subject to approval by regulatory bodies in certain states  which could limit our ability to take advantage of favorable short term market conditions 
our business could also be affected by deregulation initiatives  including the development of unbundling initiatives in the natural gas industry 
unbundling is the separation of the provision and pricing of local distribution gas services into discrete components 
it typically focuses on the separation of the distribution and gas supply components and the resulting opening of the regulated components of sales services to alternative unregulated suppliers of those services 
because of our enhanced technology and distribution system infrastructures  we believe that we are now positively positioned as unbundling evolves 
consequently  we expect there would be no significant adverse effect on our business should unbundling or further deregulation of the natural gas distribution service business occur 
finally  contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage  which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts 
we seek to minimize this risk by increasing our storage capacity and enhancing the flexibility of our natural gas marketing contracts 
our operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control  which could result in financial losses 
our risk management operations in our natural gas marketing segment are subject to market risks beyond our control including market liquidity  commodity price volatility and counterparty creditworthiness 
market liquidity is affected by the number of trading partners in the market 
although we maintain a risk management control policy  we may not be able to completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas prices or the risk in our gas trading activities which could lead to financial losses 
physical trading also introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of each trading day  as well as a risk of loss resulting from intra day fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged 
although we manage our business to maintain no open positions  at times  limited net open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a short term basis 
the determination of our net open position as of any day requires us to make assumptions as to future circumstances  including the use of gas by our customers in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions 
because the price risk associated with any net open position at the end of each day may increase if the assumptions are not realized  we review these assumptions as part of our daily monitoring activities 
net open positions may result in an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations if market prices move in an unfavorable manner 
our utility segment uses a combination of storage and financial hedges to partially insulate us against volatility in gas prices and to help moderate the effects of higher customer accounts receivable caused by higher gas prices 
our natural gas marketing segment manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of 
table of contents natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixed price purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial derivatives 
we could realize financial losses on these activities as a result of volatility in the market value of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract 
further  the use of financial instruments to conduct our hedging and market risk activities subjects us to counterparty risk 
adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract 
we believe this risk is mitigated due to the large number of counterparties used in our risk management activities 
our net periodic pension and other postretirement costs are subject to market risk as the fluctuation in the fair value of the assets used to fund our various benefit plans could lead to significant fluctuations in these costs 
finally  we are subject to interest rate risk on our commercial paper borrowings and the floating rate debt we issued in october to fund the txu gas acquisition 
we could experience higher interest expense if interest rates increase or increased volatility if short term interest rates become volatile 
national  regional and local economic conditions have a direct impact on our operations 
our operations are affected by the conditions and overall strength of the national  regional and local economies  including interest rates  changes in the capital markets and increases in the costs of our primary commodity  natural gas 
these factors impact the amount of residential  industrial and commercial growth in our service territories 
additionally  these factors could adversely impact our customer collections 
further  aem s operations are concentrated in the natural gas industry  and its customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks affecting that industry 
the execution of our business plan could be affected by an inability to access financial markets 
we rely upon access to both short term and long term capital markets as a source of liquidity to satisfy our liquidity requirements 
although we believe we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets  adverse changes in the economy  the overall health of the industries in which we operate  the increase in our indebtedness after the txu gas acquisition and changes to our credit ratings could limit access to these markets and restrict the execution of our business plan 
inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 
inflation has caused increases in certain operating expenses  and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs 
we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our utility gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates 
historically  we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so 
the ability to control expenses is an important factor that will influence future results 
the rapid increases in the price of purchased gas  which has occurred in some prior years  causes us to experience a significant increase in short term debt because we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased  which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered 
increases in purchased gas costs also slow our utility collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills  leading to higher than normal accounts receivable 
this situation also results in higher short term debt levels and increased bad debt expense 
should the price of purchased gas increase significantly in the upcoming heating season  we would expect increases in our short term debt  accounts receivable and bad debt expense during fiscal 
table of contents finally  higher costs of natural gas in recent years have already caused many of our utility customers to conserve in the use of our gas services and could lead to even more customers utilizing such conservation methods 
our operations are subject to increased competition 
we are facing increased competition from other energy suppliers as well as electric companies and from energy marketing and trading companies 
in the case of industrial customers  such as manufacturing plants  and agricultural customers  adverse economic conditions  including higher gas costs  could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower per unit costs 
risks relating to the acquisition of the txu gas operations in addition to the factors affecting our company and our industry  the risks outlined below relating to the txu gas acquisition could also adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our indebtedness and leverage increased materially with the txu gas acquisition 
on october   we issued senior unsecured notes which generated net proceeds of approximately billion 
on october  we sold million shares of common stock  which generated net proceeds of approximately million before other offering costs 
these financings were used to pay off the commercial paper that was issued to fund the txu gas acquisition 
assuming these financings had occurred on september   our total debt  as of september   would have increased from million to billion and our ratio of total debt to capitalization including short term debt and current maturities of long term debt  as of september  would have increased from percent to percent 
our ratio of total debt to capitalization is expected to be greater during the current winter heating season as we make additional short term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements 
we also increased our working capital facility from million to million on october  to meet our increased working capital requirements as a result of the txu gas acquisition 
this increase in our indebtedness could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business or economic conditions 
our long term debt is currently rated as investment grade by standard poor s corporation  moody s investors service and fitch ratings  inc  the three credit rating agencies that rate our long term debt securities 
there can be no assurance that these rating agencies will maintain investment grade ratings for our long term debt 
if we were to lose our investment grade rating  the commercial paper markets and the commodity derivatives markets could become unavailable to us 
this would increase our borrowing costs for working capital and reduce the borrowing capacity of our gas marketing affiliate 
in addition  if our commercial paper ratings were lowered  it would increase the cost of commercial paper financing and could reduce or eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper markets 
if we are unable to issue commercial paper  we intend to borrow under our bank credit facilities to meet our working capital needs 
this would increase the cost of our working capital financing 
we may not be able to implement the txu gas acquisition successfully 
the txu gas acquisition is larger than any of the nine other acquisitions we have made since in addition to operating the natural gas distribution system we acquired in the txu gas acquisition  we will manage pipeline operations on a scale greater than in the past 
as a consequence  we may experience the need for additional management attention and resources  we may be required to develop relationships with additional regulatory authorities in the service areas of the txu gas operations we acquired or we may face unanticipated challenges or delays in integrating the txu gas operations we acquired into our business 
in addition  employees important to the txu gas operations we acquired may decide not to continue employment with us 
if these events occur  the acquired operations may not achieve the results or otherwise perform as expected 

table of contents the txu gas operations we acquired are subject to their own risks  which we may not be able to manage successfully 
the financial results of the txu gas operations we acquired are subject to many of the same factors that have historically affected our financial condition and results of operations  including weather sensitivity  extensive federal  state and local regulation  increasing gas costs  competition  market risks and national  regional and local economic conditions 
in addition  the txu gas distribution operations we acquired do not have weather normalized rates 
this means we will not be able to increase customers bills to offset lower gas usage when the weather is warmer than normal 
however  their operations benefit from a rate structure that combines a monthly customer charge with a declining block rate schedule to mitigate the impact of warmer than normal weather on revenue 
the combination of the monthly customer charge and the customer billing under the first block of the declining block rate schedule provides for the recovery of most of our fixed costs for such operations under most weather conditions 
as a result  the financial results for the txu gas operations we acquired may be adversely affected in the event of a warmer than normal heating season 
the txu gas transmission operations we acquired include interconnected natural gas transmission lines  underground storage reservoirs  compressor stations and related properties within texas 
the operation of these transmission facilities also involves risks 
these include the possibility of breakdown or failure of equipment or pipelines  the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural events and the risk of performance below expected levels of throughput or efficiency 
breakdown or reduced performance of a transmission facility may prevent the facility from performing under applicable sales agreements which  in certain situations  could result in termination of those agreements or incurring a liability for liquidated damages 
insurance  warranties  indemnities or performance guarantees may not cover any or all of the liquidated damages  lost revenues or increased expenses associated with a breakdown or reduction in performance of a transmission facility 
if we are unsuccessful in managing these risks  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we have only limited recourse under the acquisition agreement for losses relating to the txu gas acquisition 
the diligence conducted in connection with the txu gas acquisition and the indemnification provided in the acquisition agreement may not be sufficient to protect us from  or compensate us for  all losses resulting from the acquisition or txu gas s prior operations 
for example  under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the first million of many indemnifiable losses are to be borne by us  and the agreement provides for sharing of losses with respect to unknown environmental matters that may affect the assets we acquired after we have borne million in costs relating to such matters 
in addition  under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the maximum aggregate amount of such losses for which txu gas will indemnify us is approximately million 
a material loss associated with the txu gas acquisition for which there is not adequate indemnification could negatively affect our results of operations  our financial condition and our reputation in the industry and reduce the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
there may be other risks or costs resulting from the txu gas acquisition that are not known to us 
we may not be aware of all of the risks associated with the txu gas acquisition 
any discovery of adverse information concerning the assets or operations we acquired could be material and  in many cases  would be subject to only limited rights of recovery 
in addition  we will likely have to make capital expenditures  which may be significant  but which amount has not been fixed  to enhance or integrate the assets and operations we acquired 
overview our utility segment net income increased million despite weather that was percent warmer than normal during fiscal the increase reflects the full year impact of the mississippi valley gas company mvg operations and rate increases in kansas  texas and mississippi  partially offset by a 
table of contents decline in our irrigation business and a one time million net of tax refund to customers in our colorado service area 
our natural gas marketing segment net income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change increased million during fiscal this increase primarily was attributable to our continued efforts to amend contracts with third parties to transfer risk to our customers and to provide higher gross profit margins and improved position management during the current year 
our fiscal results reflect pretax gains from asset sales totaling million attributable to the sale of our general and limited partnership interests in usp and the remaining limited partnership units in heritage propane partners  lp formerly owned by usp during and the sale of real property 
these asset sales provided million in cash proceeds during in july  we sold  shares of our common stock  including the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option 
the offering price was and generated net proceeds of approximately million after offering costs 
in october  we used the net proceeds from this offering  together with issuances in october of commercial paper backstopped by the bridge financing facility to consummate the acquisition of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas 
in august  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to issue  from time to time  up to billion in new common stock and or debt  which was declared effective on september  in october  we sold million common shares under the new shelf registration statement  including the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option generating net proceeds of approximately million before other offering costs 
additionally  we issued senior unsecured debt under the new shelf registration statement which generated approximately billion in net proceeds 
these proceeds were used to refinance the billion in commercial paper we issued on october  to fund the txu gas acquisition and for general corporate purposes 
our total debt to capitalization ratio at september  was percent compared with percent at september  the improvement in the debt to capitalization ratio was primarily attributable to the issuance of million shares of our common stock in july  and reduced short term debt due to strong operating cash flow generated during fiscal assuming the txu gas acquisition and financings described above had occurred on september   our debt to capitalization ratio would have increased to percent 
our debt ratings were recently downgraded as a result of the txu gas acquisition  however  our ratings are still considered investment grade 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to risk management and trading activities  allowance for doubtful accounts  legal and environmental accruals  insurance accruals  pension and postretirement obligations  deferred income taxes and the valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets 
our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee on a quarterly basis 
actual results may differ from estimates 
regulation our utility operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates  service  maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate 
our regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this 
table of contents statement requires cost based  rate regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their financial statements 
we record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable 
regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process 
as a result  certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized because they can be recovered through rates 
further  regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized 
the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations 
the impact of regulation on our utility operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 
revenue recognition sales of natural gas to our utility customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis  however  the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for utility segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed under the cycle billing method  are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 
rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms 
purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility s non gas costs 
these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of expense  such as purchased gas costs  that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility s other costs  ii represents a large component of the utility s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility 
there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments  but they do provide a dollar for dollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs 
although substantially all of our utility sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase  utility gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas due to the purchased gas adjustment mechanism 
the effects of these purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet 
energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a commodity where we are the principal in the transaction are recorded as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time of physical delivery 
realized gains and losses from the settlement of financial instruments that do not result in physical delivery related to our natural gas marketing energy trading contracts and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the market value of open contracts are included as a component of natural gas marketing revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts for the majority of our receivables  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience 
on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer s inability or reluctance to pay  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
however  if circumstances change  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be different 
circumstances which could affect our estimates include  but are not limited to  customer credit issues  the level of natural gas prices and general economic conditions 
derivatives and hedging activities in our utility segment  we use a combination of storage and financial derivatives to partially insulate us and our natural gas utility customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season 
the financial derivatives we use in our utility segment are accounted for under the mark to market method pursuant to sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
changes in the valuation of these derivatives primarily result from changes in the valuation of the portfolio of contracts  maturity and settlement of contracts and newly originated transactions 
however  because the costs of financial derivatives used in our utility segment will ultimately be recovered through our rates  current period changes in the assets and liabilities from these risk management activities are recorded as a component of deferred gas costs in accordance with sfas accordingly  there is no earnings impact to our utility segment as a result of the use of financial derivatives 
the changes in the assets and liabilities from 
table of contents risk management activities are recognized in purchased gas cost in the income statement when the related costs are recovered through our rates 
our natural gas marketing risk management activities are conducted through aem 
aem is exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas  which we manage through a combination of storage and financial derivatives  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
option contracts provide the right  but not the requirement  to buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price 
swap contracts require receipt of payment for the commodity based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price on the settlement date 
the use of these contracts is subject to our risk management policies  which are monitored for compliance on a daily basis 
we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers 
additionally  we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from pricing differences that occur over time 
we purchase or sell physical natural gas and then sell or purchase financial contracts at a price sufficient to cover our carrying costs and provide a gross profit margin 
through the use of transportation and storage services and derivatives  we are able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 
under sfas  natural gas inventory is the hedged item in a fair value hedge and is marked to market on a monthly basis using the inside ferc iferc price at the end of each month 
changes in fair value are recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
costs to store the gas are recognized in the period the costs are incurred 
we recognize revenue and the carrying value of the inventory as an associated purchased gas cost in our consolidated statement of income when we sell the gas and deliver it out of the storage facility 
derivatives associated with our natural gas inventory are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
the difference in the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory iferc and the related fair value hedge nymex is reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income 
over time  gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges  resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 
in addition  we continually manage our positions to optimize value as market conditions and other circumstances change 
similar to our inventory position  we attempt to mitigate substantially all of the commodity price risk associated with our fixed price contracts with minimum volume requirements through the use of various offsetting derivatives 
prior to april   these derivatives were not designated as hedges under sfas because they naturally locked in the economic gross profit margin at the time we entered into the contract 
the fixed price forward and offsetting derivative contracts were marked to market each month with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses recorded in revenue in our consolidated statement of income 
the unrealized gains and losses were realized as a component of revenue in the period in which we fulfilled the requirements of the fixed price contract and the derivatives settled 
to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses of the fixed price forward contracts and the offsetting derivatives did not offset exactly  our earnings experienced some volatility 
at delivery  the gains and losses on the fixed price contracts were offset by gains and losses on the derivatives  resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 
in addition  we continually manage our positions to optimize value as market conditions and other circumstances change 
effective april   we elected to treat our fixed price forward contracts as normal purchases and sales 
as a result  we ceased marking the fixed price forward contracts to market 
we designated the offsetting derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions 
as a result of this change  unrealized gains and losses on these open derivative contracts are now recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold 
this designation is expected to partially reduce the amount of volatility in our consolidated income 
table of contents statement and better reflect the economics of this type of transaction 
hedge ineffectiveness  to the extent incurred  is reported as a component of revenue 
during fiscal  we entered into four treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of million of long term debt 
we designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges of an anticipated transaction 
accordingly  to the extent effective  unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
unrealized gains are recorded when interest rates increase and unrealized losses are recorded when interest rates decline 
these treasury lock agreements were terminated in october and the million unrealized loss will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement 
the fair value of our financial derivatives is determined through a combination of prices actively quoted on national exchanges  prices provided by other external sources and prices based on models and other valuation methods 
changes in the valuation of our financial derivatives primarily result from changes in market prices  the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts  maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions  each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our derivatives 
we believe the market prices and models used to value these derivatives represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts 
values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions 
impairment assessments we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill  intangible assets subject to amortization and long lived assets 
we currently have no indefinite lived intangible assets 
we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise 
we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
our reporting units and our operating segments are the same as each operating unit represents a component of our business 
goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill 
the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows  future growth rates and the discount rate 
an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that our intangible assets subject to amortization and other long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows 
these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made 
changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge 
an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
pension and other postretirement plans pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets and assumed discount rates and demographic data 
the assumed return on plan assets is based on management s expectation of the long term return on the portfolio of plan assets 
the discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized

year ended september  compared with year ended september  utility segment our utility segment has historically contributed to percent of our consolidated net income 
the primary factors that impact the results of our utility operations are seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
natural gas sales to residential  commercial and public authority customers are affected by winter heating season requirements 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each year 
accordingly  our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 
utility sales to industrial customers are much less weather sensitive 
utility sales to agricultural customers  which typically use natural gas to power irrigation pumps during the period from march through september  are primarily affected by rainfall amounts and the price of natural gas 
changes in the cost of gas impact revenue but do not directly affect our gross profit from utility operations because the fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to our customers 
accordingly  we believe gross profit margin is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues 
however  higher gas costs may cause customers to conserve  or  in the case of industrial customers  to use alternative energy sources 
higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections  resulting in higher bad debt expense 
the effects of weather that is above or below normal are partially offset through weather normalization adjustments  or wna  in certain of our service areas 
wna allows us to increase the base rate portion of customers bills when weather is warmer than normal and decrease the base rate when weather is colder than normal 

table of contents operating income utility gross profit margin increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  total throughput for our utility business was bcf during the year compared to bcf in the prior year 
excluding intercompany throughput  consolidated throughput for our utility business was bcf during the year  compared with bcf in the prior year 
the increase in utility gross profit margin primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of mississippi valley gas company mvg whose operations are included for the entire first quarter in fiscal year  compared with one month in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year resulting in an increase in utility gross profit margin and total throughput of million and bcf 
utility gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by rate increases received in kansas  texas and mississippi and a million year over year increase in the effect of wna in our wna service areas 
these increases were offset partially by the impact of weather that was percent warmer than that of the prior year and percent warmer than normal  resulting in a decrease of approximately million and lower irrigation sales in our west texas division resulting in a decrease of approximately million 
warmer than normal weather particularly impacted our service areas in our louisiana  mid states and west texas divisions 
the decrease in throughput also reflects a decrease in consumption attributable to the impact of conservation and the continued introduction of more efficient gas appliances in our service areas 
finally  our utility gross profit margin for the year ended september  reflects a one time reduction resulting from a regulatory ruling to refund million to our customers in our colorado service area 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes  increased percent to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  operation and maintenance expense increased  primarily due to the addition of million related to the mvg acquisition in december and higher labor and benefit costs 
taxes other than income taxes increased million  primarily due to additional franchise  payroll and property taxes associated with the mvg assets acquired in december franchise and state gross receipts taxes are paid by our customers as a component of their monthly bills  thus  these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no effect on net income 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  which primarily reflects mvg depreciation for the full year of fiscal compared with ten months in the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in our provision for doubtful accounts attributable to continued improvement in accounts receivable collections during fiscal as a result of the aforementioned factors  our utility segment operating income for the year ended september  decreased to million from million for the year ended september  miscellaneous income expense miscellaneous income for the year ended september  was million  compared with expense of million for the year ended september  the million change was attributable primarily to the absence in of weather insurance amortization totaling million  which was recognized in the prior year due to the termination of our weather insurance policy in the third quarter of fiscal and the recognition of a million gain on the sale of real property during fiscal interest charges interest charges increased percent for the year ended september  to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable primarily to a higher average outstanding debt balance resulting from the financing obtained to fund the acquisition of mvg in december 
table of contents natural gas marketing segment our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply  arranges transportation and or storage logistics and ultimately delivers the gas to our customers at competitive prices 
to facilitate this process  we utilize proprietary and customer owned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request  including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and market based prices  contract negotiation and administration  load forecasting  gas storage acquisition and management services  transportation services  peaking sales and balancing services  capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of derivative products 
as a result  our revenues arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we deliver 
we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers 
additionally  we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time 
we purchase or sell physical natural gas and then sell or purchase financial contracts at a price sufficient to cover our carrying costs and provide a gross profit margin 
through the use of transportation and storage services and derivatives  we are able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 
operating income gross profit margin for our natural gas marketing segment consists primarily of marketing activities  which represent the utilization of proprietary and customer owned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request  and storage activities  which are derived from the optimization of our managed proprietary and third party storage and transportation assets

the decrease in consolidated natural gas marketing sales volumes was primarily due to overall warmer temperatures during the heating season compared with the prior year period 
our natural gas marketing gross profit margin for the year ended september  
table of contents included an unrealized loss on open contracts of million compared with an unrealized gain on open contracts of million in the prior year period 
the contribution to gross profit from our storage activities was a loss of million for the year ended september  compared to a loss of million for the year ended september  the million improvement primarily was attributable to a million improvement in the realized storage contribution for the year ended september  compared to the prior year offset by a million decrease in unrealized income associated with our storage portfolio compared to the prior year period 
the improvement in the realized storage contribution for the year ended september  primarily was due to our inability during the heating season to withdraw planned volumes from storage to meet our customer requirements caused by operational  contractual and regulatory limitations relating to our storage facilities  which reduced our realized storage contributions during fiscal this situation did not recur in fiscal the decrease in unrealized income in the current period was primarily attributable to a less favorable movement during the year ended september  in the forward indices used to value the storage financial instruments than in the prior year combined with slightly lower physical natural gas storage quantities at september  compared to the prior year 
our marketing activities contributed million to our gross profit margin for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the increase in the marketing contribution primarily was attributable to our continued efforts to amend contracts with third parties to transfer risk to our customers and to provide higher gross profit margins and improved position management during the current year 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes  increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase in operating expense was attributable primarily to higher labor and benefit costs resulting from the improvement in earnings for the fiscal year and an increase in temporary and permanent personnel due to systems and process improvements in the marketing segment 
the improved gross profit margin resulted in an increase in our natural gas marketing segment operating income to million for the year ended september  compared with operating income of million for the year ended september  miscellaneous income miscellaneous income for the year ended september  was million  compared with income of million for the year ended september  the million decrease was attributable primarily to lower interest income earned on cash held on deposit in margin accounts due to favorable valuations on our financial derivatives  which reduced the need to deposit cash into margin accounts 
other nonutility segment operating income our other nonutility operating income decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease in our other nonutility operating income was attributable primarily to a decrease in demand charges recognized by atmos pipeline and storage for storage services provided during the year ended september  compared to the prior year period and lower transported volumes of approximately bcf by atmos pipeline and storage due to overall warmer weather during the winter heating season 
the decrease was also attributable to a million decrease in a monthly facilities fees charged by trans louisiana gas pipeline  inc as a result of a settlement reached with the louisiana public service commission in october our other nonutility operating income for the year ended september  also included an unrealized loss on open contracts of million compared with no unrealized gain our loss in the prior year as atmos pipeline and storage started to hedge its storage inventory during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents miscellaneous income miscellaneous income for the year ended september  was million  compared with income of million for the year ended september  the million increase was attributable primarily to a million pretax gain associated with the sale in january of our general and limited partnership interests in usp and the sale in june of the remaining limited partnership units in heritage propane partners  lp formerly owned by usp 
this increase was offset partially by lower equity earnings from our investment in usp resulting from the sale and the absence in of a million gain recorded in associated with a sales type lease of a distributed electric generation plant 
interest charges interest charges increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to a higher average outstanding debt balance resulting from increased third party borrowings of million used to reduce aeh s intercompany borrowings with atmos energy corporation

excluding intercompany throughput  total consolidated throughput for our utility business was bcf during fiscal  compared with bcf in the prior year 
the increase in utility gross profit and total throughput was primarily attributable to the impact of the mvg acquisition in december  which increased utility gross profit and total throughput by million and bcf 
the increase in utility gross profit was also attributable to a million increase in our base charges primarily in louisiana as a result of our annual rate stabilization clause filing which became effective in november these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in revenues from the impact of wna as a result of weather in our wna service areas being percent colder than normal for the year ended september  operating expenses increased percent to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  operation and maintenance expense increased primarily due to the addition of million related to the mvg acquisition in december  a million increase in the provision for doubtful accounts as a result of higher revenues and gas prices and higher employee costs 
taxes other than income taxes increased million primarily due to additional franchise  payroll and property taxes associated with the mvg assets acquired in december note that franchise and state gross receipts taxes are paid by our customers  thus  these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no effect on net income 
as a result of the aforementioned factors  our utility segment operating income for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  miscellaneous income expense miscellaneous expense for the year ended september  was million  compared with income of million for the year ended september  the million change was attributable primarily to a million charge associated with the cancellation of our weather insurance policy during the third quarter of fiscal  which increased our total insurance policy amortization to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal

excluding intercompany sales volumes  natural gas marketing sales volumes were bcf during the year ended september  compared with bcf in the prior year 
the increase in natural gas marketing sales volumes was primarily due to overall colder temperatures during the heating season compared with the prior year 
our natural gas marketing gross profit included an unrealized gain on open contracts of million in fiscal compared with an unrealized loss on open contracts of million in fiscal our storage activities within the natural gas marketing segment contributed a loss of million to gross profit margin for the year ended september  compared to a million loss for the year ended september  the million improvement in the contribution from our storage activities was primarily attributable to a million greater realized loss in the current year due to our inability during the heating season to withdraw planned volumes from storage to meet our customer requirements caused by operational  contractual and regulatory limitations relating to our storage facilities offset by an million increase in the unrealized storage contributions in the current year compared to the prior year 
the greater unrealized contribution in the current year was primarily attributable to a favorable movement during the year ended september  in the forward indices used to value the storage financial instruments than in the prior year combined with higher physical natural gas storage quantities at september  compared to the prior year 
our marketing activities contributed million to our gross profit margin for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the decrease in the marketing contribution primarily was attributable to a million decrease in realized margin combined 
table of contents with a million decrease in our unrealized margin 
the decrease in realized margin was primarily attributable to price risk associated with certain full requirements contracts which reduced marketing margins during the winter of we have subsequently restructured these contracts to mitigate the price risk associated with these contracts 
the decrease in unrealized margin was primarily attributable to accounting changes related to the rescission of eitf and the impact on certain contracts which had previously been marked under eitf  which were not considered derivatives under sfas operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease in operating expenses primarily was attributable to lower employee incentive compensation costs during the current year 
as a result of the above  our natural gas marketing segment generated operating income of million for the year ended september  compared with operating income of million for the year ended september  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on january   we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect a change in the way we account for our storage and transportation contracts 
we previously accounted for those contracts under eitf  accounting for energy trading and risk management activities  which required us to record estimated future gains on our storage and transportation contracts at the time we entered into the contracts and to mark those contracts to market value each month 
effective january   we no longer mark those contracts to market 
as a result  we expensed million  net of applicable income tax benefit  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
other nonutility segment operating income our other nonutility segment operating income increased to million during the year ended september  compared with million for the prior year 
the increase in our nonutility segment operating income was primarily attributable to increased asset management activities in the current year and an increase in leasing income attributable to the commencement in of a new lease for a distributed electric generation plant 
miscellaneous income miscellaneous income for the year ended september  was million  compared with income of million for the year ended september  the million change was primarily attributable to a million gain associated with a sales type lease of a distributed electric generation plant which was recognized in the first quarter of and improved earnings from our indirect investment in heritage propane partners lp liquidity and capital resources our working capital and liquidity for capital expenditures and other cash needs are provided from internally generated funds  borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program and funds raised from the public debt and equity capital markets 
we believe that these sources of funds will provide the necessary working capital and liquidity for capital expenditures and other cash needs for fiscal we believe that these needs can be provided from the same sources of capital 

table of contents capitalization the following presents our capitalization as of september  and september in thousands  except percentages short term debt long term debt shareholders equity total capitalization  including short term debt total debt as a percentage of total capitalization  including short term debt  was percent and percent at september  and the improvement in the debt to capitalization ratio was primarily attributable to the issuance of million shares of our common stock in july  and reduced short term debt due to strong operating cash flow generated during fiscal assuming the txu gas acquisition and related debt and equity financings had occurred on september   our debt to capitalization ratio would have increased to percent 
our ratio of total debt to capitalization is expected to be greater during the current winter heating season as we make additional short term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements 
within three to five years from the closing of the acquisition  we intend to reduce our capitalization ratio to a target range of to percent through cash flow generated from operations  continued issuance of new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and retirement savings plan  access to the equity capital markets and reduced annual maintenance and capital expenditures 
cash flows our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors  some of which we cannot control 
these include regulatory changes  the price for our products and services  the demand for such products and services  margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices  operational risks  the successful integration of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas we acquired and other factors 
cash flows from operating activities year over year changes in our operating cash flows are attributable primarily to working capital changes within our utility segment resulting from the impact of weather  the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections  payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries 
for the year ended september   we generated operating cash flow of million compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 
year ended september  fiscal operating cash flows were favorably impacted by several items 
improved customer collections during fiscal  compared with the prior year  resulted in a million increase in operating cash flow 
further  cash used for natural gas inventories decreased by million compared with the prior year 
the decrease was attributable to lower injections of natural gas into storage  partially offset by higher prices 
the reduction in the lag between the time period when we purchase our natural gas and the period in which we can include this cost in our gas rates improved operating cash flow by million 
changes in cash held on deposit in margin accounts resulted in an increase in operating cash flow of million 
this account represents deposits recorded to collateralize certain of our financial derivatives purchased in support of our natural gas marketing activities 
the favorable change was attributable to the fact that the fair value of financial instruments held by aem represented a net asset position at september   which eliminated 
table of contents the need to place cash in margin accounts 
finally  other working capital and other changes improved operating cash flow by million 
these changes primarily related to various increases in deferred credits and other liabilities  other current liabilities and income taxes payable partially offset by lower deferred income tax expense as compared with the prior year 
year ended september  fiscal operating cash flow was adversely impacted by a million increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenues and the timing of customer account collections 
the increase in revenues was attributable to a percent increase in consolidated utility throughput as a result of the impact of our mvg acquisition 
operating cash flow was also adversely impacted by a significant increase in natural gas prices 
these increases resulted in a million increase in gas stored underground and a million increase in deferred gas costs 
finally  operating cash flow reflects the impact of the funding of our pension plan in june  which included a million cash payment 
this funding is discussed under the caption pension and postretirement benefits obligations below 
year ended september  in fiscal  operating cash flow was impacted favorably by a million reduction in cash held on deposit in margin accounts 
during the winter and spring of  our cash deposit requirements increased as a result of higher unrealized losses on our financial derivatives 
operating cash flow was also favorably impacted by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a million increase in other current liabilities primarily attributable to the timing of payments as compared with the prior year 
finally  operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a million decrease in deferred gas costs reflecting the favorable timing between the billing of gas costs to our customers and the purchase of natural gas 
these favorable impacts were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable 
this increase was attributable to revenue increases resulting from the inclusion of the lgs and woodward marketing operations for a full year and the timing of customer account collections 
cash flows from investing activities during the last three years  a substantial portion of our cash resources was used to fund acquisitions  our ongoing construction program to provide natural gas services to our customer base and technology improvements 
for the year ended september   we invested million compared with million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  capital expenditures were million during the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  capital projects for fiscal years  and include expenditures for additional mains  services  meters and equipment to grow our customer base 
additionally  capital expenditures for include approximately million for mississippi valley gas company division capital expenditures 
fiscal cash flows from investing activities also included million for the acquisition of assets to be leased to third parties 
cash used for investing activities for the current year includes the receipt of million generated from the sale of our limited and general partnership interests in usp in january million  the sale of the remaining limited partnership units in heritage propane partners  lp formerly owned by usp million and the sale of real property million 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to range from million to million 
these expenditures include additional mains  services  meters and equipment 
of this amount  approximately million is expected to be incurred by the mid tex division

cash flows from financing activities for the year ended september   our financing activities provided million in cash 
fiscal cash from financing activities provided cash of million  and in fiscal our financing activities represented a use of million 
our significant financing activities for the three years ended september  are summarized as follows in july  we sold  shares of our common stock  including the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option 
the offering price was and generated net proceeds of million 
in october  we used the net proceeds from this offering  together with borrowings under the bridge financing facility to consummate the acquisition of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas 
in june and july  we sold a total of  shares of our common stock in a public offering  which generated net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds were used to finance a portion of our pension plan contribution  repay short term debt and for general corporate purposes 
during fiscal  we received million from a short term acquisition credit facility which was used primarily to fund the million cash portion of the purchase price for mvg in december and to repay million of mvg s outstanding debt 
on january   we issued million of senior notes due the net proceeds of million were used to refinance the short term acquisition credit facility of million  to repay million in unsecured senior notes held by institutional lenders  short term debt under our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes

we repaid million of long term debt during fiscal  which includes the million repayment of unsecured senior notes with the proceeds received from our january debt offering 
fiscal and payments on long term debt were million and million 
during fiscal  we paid million in cash dividends compared with dividend payments of million and million for fiscal and the increase in dividends paid over the preceding three years reflects increases in the quarterly dividend rate and the number of shares outstanding 
dividend payments in fiscal will increase substantially as a result of the july and october equity offerings 

table of contents during the year ended september   we issued  shares of common stock 
of these shares   shares were issued in july to provide cash to partially fund the acquisition of the txu gas operations

the net proceeds of million were used to repay debt under an acquisition credit facility used to finance our acquisition of mvg  to repay million in unsecured senior notes held by institutional lenders and short term debt under our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes 
additionally  we sold  shares of our common stock in connection with our offering under the registration statement to provide additional funding for our pension account plan 
in july  we sold  shares of our common stock  including the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option  which exhausted the remaining availability under this shelf registration statement 
in august  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to issue  from time to time  up to billion in new common stock and or debt  which became effective on september  in october  we sold million common shares  including the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option of million shares  under the new shelf registration statement  generating net proceeds of million before other offering costs

the net proceeds from the sale of these senior notes was billion 
the net proceeds from the october common stock and senior notes offerings  combined with the net proceeds from our july offering were used to pay off the billion in outstanding commercial paper backstopped by a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement  which we entered into on september  for bridge financing for the txu gas acquisition 
after issuing the debt and equity in october we have approximately million of availability remaining under the shelf registration statement 

table of contents credit facilities we maintain both committed and uncommitted credit facilities 
borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a when and as needed basis at the discretion of the bank 
our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our short term borrowing requirements  which are typically highest during colder winter months 
our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers needs during periods of cold weather 
our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures will increase substantially as a result of the acquisition of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas 
on october   we replaced our million credit facility with a new million committed credit facility that will serve as a backup liquidity facility for our commercial paper program 
we believe this facility  combined with our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund these increased working capital needs 
these facilities are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
credit rating our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short term and long term financing  in addition to the cost of such financing 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors  including debt to total capitalization  operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt  operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status 
in addition  the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time  the quality of our management and business strategy  the risk associated with our utility and nonutility businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate 
our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard poor s corporation s p  moody s investors service moody s and fitch ratings  inc fitch 
our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows s p moody s fitch long term debt bbb baa bbb commercial paper a p f these ratings reflect downgrades that each of the three rating agencies issued us as a result of the txu gas acquisition 
currently  s p and moody s maintains a stable outlook and fitch maintains a negative outlook 
none of our ratings are currently under review 
a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
all of our current ratings for long term debt are categorized as investment grade 
the highest investment grade credit rating for s p is aaa  moody s is aaa and fitch is aaa 
the lowest investment grade credit rating for s p is bbb  moody s is baa and fitch is bbb 
our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating 
there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered  or withdrawn entirely  by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances so warrant 
debt covenants in addition to the percent limit on our total debt to capitalization ratio imposed by our committed credit facilities  our first mortgage bonds provide for certain cash flow requirements and restrictions on additional indebtedness  sale of assets and payment of dividends 
under the most restrictive of such covenants  cumulative cash dividends paid after december   may not exceed the sum of our accumulated net income for periods after december   plus million 
at september   approximately million of retained earnings was unrestricted with respect to the payment of dividends 
we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september  if we do not comply with our debt covenants  we may be required to repay our outstanding balances on demand  provide additional 
table of contents collateral or take other corrective actions 
our two public debt indentures relating to our senior notes and debentures  as well as our new million revolving credit agreement  each contain a default provision that is triggered if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other credit agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of million to in excess of million becomes due by acceleration or is not paid at maturity 
in addition  aem s credit agreement contains a cross default provision whereby aem would be in default if it defaults on any other financial obligation  as defined  by at least thousand 
additionally  this agreement contains a provision that would limit the amount of credit available if atmos is downgraded below an s p rating of bbb and a moody s rating of baa except as described above  we have no trigger events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in specified credit ratings or stock price  nor have we entered into any transactions that would require us to issue equity based on our credit rating or other trigger events

contractual demand fees for contracted storage for our utility segment are excluded as these costs are fully recoverable through our purchase gas adjustment mechanisms 
represents liabilities for natural gas commodity derivative contracts and our treasury lock agreements 
the less than one year amount includes the million settlement of our treasury lock agreements in october  which is not subject to continuing market risk 
the remaining liabilities represent natural gas commodity derivative contracts that were valued as of september  the ultimate settlement amounts of these remaining liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk

table of contents aem has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts 
at september   aem was committed to purchase bcf within one year and bcf between one to three years under indexed contracts 
aem was committed to purchase bcf within one year and bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from to our utility segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year 
commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices 
commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract 
on september   we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with a third party financing institution for bridge financing for the txu gas acquisition 
there were no amounts outstanding under the facility at september  on october   we issued billion in commercial paper that was backstopped by this facility 
in october  we repaid the billion in commercial paper with proceeds received from our october debt and equity offerings and canceled the facility 
risk management activities we conduct risk management activities through both our utility and natural gas marketing segments 
in our utility segment  we use a combination of storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to partially insulate us and our customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season 
in our natural gas marketing segment  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
finally  during fiscal  we entered into four treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of million of long term debt 
these treasury lock agreements were settled in october with a net million payment to the counterparties 
approximately million of the million obligation will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the next five years  and the remaining amount  approximately million  will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the next ten years 
our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we record our derivatives as a component of risk management assets and liabilities  which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying derivative 
substantially all of our derivative financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 
the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our utility and natural gas marketing derivative contract activities for the year ended september  in thousands natural gas utility marketing fair value of contracts at september  contracts realized settled fair value of new contracts other changes in value fair value of contracts at september  
table of contents the fair value of our utility and natural gas marketing derivative contracts at september   is segregated below by time period and fair value source 
fair value of contracts at september  maturity in years greater total fair source of fair value less than than value in thousands prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods total fair value as of september   a significant portion of aem s stored gas inventory was scheduled to be sold within six months 
since aem actively manages and optimizes its portfolio  it may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans based on market conditions 
therefore  we cannot predict that our actual inventory withdrawals will match the planned schedule as of september  generally  differences between injection and withdrawal prices are locked in through the use of derivatives  therefore  there is generally no significant permanent earnings impact associated with changes in monthly prices in the interim between injections and withdrawals 
however  there may be significant quarterly earnings volatility 
further  permanent earnings impacts may arise if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions 
any change in the timing of planned injections or withdrawals from one time period to another generally is conducted to enhance the future profitability of the storage position 
additionally  aem monitors and adjusts the amount of storage capacity it holds on a discretionary basis 
pension and postretirement benefits obligations for the fiscal year ended september   our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was million  compared with million and million for the period ended september  and a portion of these costs is capitalized into our utility rate base  as these costs are recoverable through our gas utility rates 
costs that are not capitalized are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 
the decrease in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal compared with fiscal primarily reflects the impact of adopting the provisions of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act  beginning with the second quarter of  which reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and our net postretirement benefit obligation costs by million 
the total income statement impact was million as a portion of this benefit was capitalized 
further  the expected return on plan assets  which reduces the net periodic pension cost and other benefits cost  increased as compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in total assets attributable to the full year effect of the contributions we made to the atmos pension account plan in fiscal and the inclusion of the mvg pension plan assets during fiscal partially offset by a basis point decrease in the expected return on plan asset assumption used to determine fiscal net periodic pension cost 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the service cost and the recognized actuarial loss attributable to a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension and other benefits costs  resulting from a decrease in interest rates at the time the assumptions were established 
the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in the service cost and interest cost attributable to an increase in our projected benefit obligations 
the increase in the projected benefit obligations reflected the increase in the number of plan participants due to the mvg acquisition and an increase attributable to a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation reflecting a decline in market interest rates 

table of contents we did not contribute to our pension plans during fiscal in june  we contributed to the atmos energy corporation master retirement trust for the benefit of the atmos energy corporation pension account plan million in cash and  shares of atmos restricted common stock with a value of million 
as a result of this contribution and improved investment returns during fiscal  the underfunded status of the plan improved by approximately million  and the million reduction to equity recorded as of september  was eliminated as of september  we are not required to make a minimum funding contribution to our pension plans during fiscal nor do we intend to make voluntary contributions during we contributed million  million and million to our postretirement benefits plans for the years ended september   and we anticipate contributing million to our postretirement benefit plans during fiscal the projected pension liability  future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change  depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date 
these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns  changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan 
the discount rate used generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid 
the expected return on plan assets is based on management s expectation of the long term return on the portfolio of plan assets 
these rates have generally declined since fiscal due to a decline in interest rates and relatively weak market performance of the underlying plan assets 
the rate of compensation increase is established based upon our internal budgets 
the actuarial assumptions used to determine the pension liability and net periodic pension and other benefits costs are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we did not assume the existing employee benefit liabilities or plans of txu gas 
however  for purposes of determining our annual pension cost we have agreed to give the transitioned employees credit for years of txu gas service under our pension plan 
for purposes of our post retirement medical plan  we received a credit of million subject to post closing adjustment against the purchase price to permit us to provide partial past service credits for retiree medical benefits under our retiree medical plan 
the million credit approximates the actuarially determined present value of the accumulated benefits related to the past service of the transferred employees 
as a result of the txu gas acquisition on october   our pension and other postretirement benefits costs should increase substantially during fiscal recent accounting developments recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity 
interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business 
we conduct risk management activities through both our utility and natural gas marketing segments 
in our utility segment  we use a combination of storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to partially insulate us and our customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season 
in our natural gas marketing segment  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short term commercial paper  our other short term borrowings and  beginning in fiscal  our new floating rate borrowings 

table of contents commodity price risk utility segment we purchase natural gas for our utility operations 
substantially all of the cost of gas purchased for utility operations is recovered from our customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms 
however  our utility operations have commodity price risk exposure to fluctuations in spot natural gas prices related to purchases for sales to our non regulated energy services customers at fixed prices 
for our utility segment  we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate commodity price risk by applying a hypothetical percent increase in the portion of our gas cost related to fixed price non regulated sales 
based on these projected non regulated gas sales  a hypothetical percent increase in fixed prices based upon the september  three month market strip would increase our purchased gas cost by approximately million in fiscal natural gas marketing segment our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas 
for our natural gas marketing segment  we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate commodity price risk by applying a change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage at the end of each period 
based on aeh s net open position including existing storage at september  of bcf  a change in the forward nymex price would have had less than a million impact on our consolidated net income 
interest rate risk our earnings are exposed to changes in short term interest rates associated with our short term commercial paper program  other short term borrowings and  beginning in fiscal  our new floating rate debt 
we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our short term interest rate risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate our short term interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average of a one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our short term borrowings 
had interest rates associated with our short term borrowings outstanding during fiscal increased by an average of one percent  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million during as a result of the txu gas acquisition on october   our interest expense should increase substantially during fiscal we also assess market risk for our fixed rate  long term obligations 
we estimate market risk for our fixed rate  long term obligations as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates associated with these debt instruments 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
assuming this one percent hypothetical decrease  the fair value of our fixed rate  long term obligations outstanding as of september  would have increased by approximately million 
as of september   we were not engaged in any other activities which would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or market commodity prices
