item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s financial performance continues to be dependent in large part upon the growth in its outstanding loans receivable  the ongoing introduction of new products and services for marketing to its customer base  the maintenance of loan quality and acceptable levels of operating expenses 
since march   gross loans receivable have increased at a annual compounded rate from million to million at march  the increase reflects both the higher volume of loans generated through the company s existing offices and the contribution of loans generated from new offices opened or acquired over the period 
during this same five year period  the company has grown from offices to offices as of march  the company plans to open or acquire at least new offices in each of the next two fiscal years 

table of contents the company continues to identify new products and services for marketing to its customer base 
in addition to new insurance related products  which have been introduced in selected states over the last several years  the company sells and finances electronic items and appliances to its existing customer base 
this program is called the world class buying club 
total loan volume under this program amounted to million during fiscal  a increase from the prior fiscal year

the company s paradata financial systems subsidiary provides data processing systems to separate finance companies  including the company  and currently supports approximately  individual branch offices in states

management believes that these loans provide lower expense and loss ratios  thus providing positive contributions 
while the company does not intend to change its primary lending focus from its small loan business  it does intend to continue expanding the larger loan product line as part of its ongoing growth strategy 
in fiscal  the company tested an income tax return preparation and refund anticipation loan program in of its offices 
based on the results of this test  the company expanded this program in fiscal into substantially all of its offices

critical accounting policies the company s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the finance company industry 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies involve significant judgment by the company s management  including the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
as a result  changes in these estimates and assumptions could significantly affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company considers its policies regarding the allowance for loan losses to be its most critical accounting policy due to the significant degree of management judgment 
the company has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses which takes into consideration various assumptions and estimates with respect to the loan portfolio 
the company s assumptions and estimates may be affected in the future by changes in economic conditions  among other factors 
for additional discussion concerning the allowance for loan losses  see credit quality below 
credit quality the company s delinquency and net charge off ratios reflect  among other factors  changes in the mix of loans in the portfolio  the quality of receivables  the success of collection efforts  bankruptcy trends and general economic conditions 
delinquency is computed on the basis of the date of the last full contractual payment on a loan known as the recency method and on the basis of the amount past due in accordance with original payment terms of a loan known as the contractual method 
management closely monitors portfolio delinquency using both methods to measure the quality of the company s loan portfolio and the probability of credit losses 

table of contents the following table classifies the gross loans receivable of the company that were delinquent on a recency and contractual basis for at least days at march    and at march  dollars in thousands recency basis days past due days or more past due total percentage of period end gross loans receivable contractual basis days past due days or more past due total percentage of period end gross loans receivable loans are charged off at the earlier of when such loans are deemed to be uncollectible or when six months have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual payment 
the company s charge off policy has been consistently applied  and no significant changes have been made to the policy during the periods reported 
management considers the charge off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
at the end of fiscal  the company experienced a decrease in contractual delinquency from at march  to at the end of the current fiscal year 
the delinquency rate also decreased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of the current fiscal year on a recency basis 
charge offs as a percent of average loans increased from in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal  approximately of the company s loans were generated through renewals of outstanding loans and the origination of new loans to previous customers 
a renewal represents a new loan transaction with a present customer in which a portion of the new loan proceeds is used to repay the balance of an existing loan and the remaining portion is advanced to the customer 
for fiscal   and  the percentages of the company s loan originations that were renewals of existing loans were  and  respectively 
the company s renewal policies are determined based on state regulations and customer payment history 
a renewal is considered a current renewal if the customer is no more than days delinquent on a contractual basis 
delinquent renewals may be extended to customers that are more than days past due on a contractual basis if the customer completes a new application and the manager believes that the customer s ability and intent to repay has improved 
it is the company s policy to not renew delinquent loans in amounts greater than the original amounts financed 
in all cases  a customer must complete a new application every two years 
during fiscal  delinquent renewals represented less than of the company s total loan volume 
charge offs  as a percentage of loans made by category  are greatest on loans made to new borrowers and less on loans made to former borrowers and renewals 
this is as expected due to the payment history experience available on repeat borrowers 
however  as a percentage of total loans charged off  renewals represent the greatest percentage due to the volume of loans made in this category 
the following table depicts the charge offs as a percent of loans made by category and as a percent of total charge offs during fiscal loan volume by category percent of total charge offs percent of loans made renewals former borrowers new borrowers 
table of contents the company maintains an allowance for loan losses in an amount that  in management s opinion  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the company charges against current earnings  as a provision for loan losses  amounts added to the allowance to maintain it at levels expected to cover probable losses of principal 
when establishing the allowance for loan losses  the company takes into consideration the growth of the loan portfolio  the mix of the loan portfolio  current levels of charge offs  current levels of delinquencies  and current economic factors 
in accordance with statement of accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 the company accrues an estimated loss if it is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
it is probable that there are losses in the existing portfolio 
to estimate the losses  the company uses historical information for net charge offs and average loan life by loan type 
this methodology is based on the fact that many customers renew their loans prior to the contractual maturity 
average contractual loan terms are approximately nine months and the average life is approximately four months 
based on this methodology  the company had an allowance for loan losses that approximated six months of average net charge offs at march    and therefore  at each year end the company had an allowance for loan losses that covers estimated losses for its existing loans based on historical charge offs and average lives 
in addition  the entire loan portfolio turns over approximately times during a typical twelve month period 
therefore  a large percentage of loans that are charged off during any fiscal year are not on the company s books at the beginning of the fiscal year 
the company believes that it is not appropriate to provide for losses on loans that have not been originated  that twelve months of net charge offs is not needed in the allowance  and that the methodology employed is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
for the years ended march   and  the company recorded adjustments of approximately million  million  and  respectively  to the allowance for loan losses in connection with acquisitions in accordance generally accepted accounting principles 
these adjustments represent the allowance for loan losses on acquired loans 
the company records acquired loans at fair value based on current interest rates  less allowances for uncollectibility and collection costs 
the company normally records all acquired loans on its books  however  the acquired loan portfolios generally include some loans that the company deems uncollectible but which do not have an allowance assigned to them 
an allowance for loan losses is then estimated based on a review of the loan portfolio  considering delinquency levels  charge offs  loan mix and other current economic factors 
the company then records the acquired loans at their gross value and records the related allowance for loan losses as an adjustment to their allowance for loan losses 
this is reflected as purchase accounting acquisitions in the table below 
subsequent charge offs related to acquired loans are reflected in the purchase accounting acquisition adjustment in the year of acquisition 
the company believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses in the existing portfolio at march  the following is a summary of the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended march    and march  balance at the beginning of the year provision for loan losses loan losses recoveries purchase accounting acquisitions balance at the end of the year allowance as a percentage of loans receivable  net of unearned and deferred fees net charge offs as a percentage of average loans receivable average loans receivable have been determined by averaging month end gross loans receivable less unearned interest and deferred fees over the indicated period 
quarterly information and seasonality the company s loan volume and corresponding loans receivable follow seasonal trends 
the company s highest loan demand typically occurs from october through december  its third fiscal quarter 
loan demand has generally been the lowest and loan repayment highest from january to march  its fourth fiscal quarter 
loan volume and average balances typically remain relatively level during the remainder of the year 
this seasonal trend affects quarterly operating performance through 
table of contents corresponding fluctuations in interest and fee income and insurance commissions earned and the provision for loan losses recorded  as well as fluctuations in the company s cash needs 
consequently  operating results for the company s third fiscal quarter generally are significantly lower than in other quarters and operating results for its fourth fiscal quarter significantly higher than in other quarters

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments consist of the following cash  loans receivable  senior notes payable  subordinated notes payable and other notes payable 
fair value approximates carrying value for all of these instruments

inflation the company does not believe that inflation has a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
while increases in operating costs would adversely affect the company s operations  the consumer lending laws of three of the ten states in which the company operates allow indexing of maximum loan amounts to the consumer price index 
these provisions will allow the company to make larger loans at existing interest rates in those states  which could partially offset the potential increase in operating costs due to inflation
