the company s operations are comprised of two reportable segments within the highway and transportation safety industry  concentrating on safety problems and designing products to provide transportation safety solutions 
the company s two reportable segments are the manufacture and sale of highway and transportation safety products which protect and direct  and the manufacture and sale of products and services which inform that are often referred to as intelligent transportation systems its products 
the company s protect and direct segment provides solutions for improving safety on the roads either by minimizing the severity of crashes that occur or by preventing crashes from occurring by directing or guiding traffic 
the primary product lines within the protect and direct segment include energy absorbing products such as crash cushions  truck mounted attenuators  sand filled barrels and water filled barriers  and directing and guiding products such as flexible post delineators and glare screen systems 
the company s inform segment provides solutions for improving traffic flow and safety on roads and runways by providing information 
the primary product lines within the inform segment include intelligent intersection control systems  automated enforcement systems  video detection systems  mobile and permanent variable message signs  advanced sensing products which measure distance  count and classify vehicles  and sense weather conditions  computerized highway advisory radio transmitting systems  automated red light enforcement systems  and other transportation equipment 
the company s products are sold by both a direct sales force and a distribution network to customers in the highway construction and safety business  state departments of transportation  county and local governments and other governmental transportation agencies 
the domestic market for highway and transportation safety products is directly affected by federal  state and local governmental policies 
a portion of the company s sales is ultimately financed by funds provided to the states by the federal government 
historically  these funds have covered to of the cost of highway safety projects on roads constructed or maintained with federal assistance 
the company s business is seasonal with a higher level of sales and earnings in the company s fourth fiscal quarter 
results of operations the results for were below the company s expectations  largely as a result of the prolonged delay in the passage of new federal highway funding legislation and state budgetary constraints

excluding acquisitions  sales for increased as sales for were unusually low as the company believes it was affected by both generally weak economic conditions and state budgetary positions 
protect and direct net sales for the company s protect and direct segment for fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal the company believes the decrease in sales is due to state budgetary constraints and transportation funding uncertainties caused by the delay in the passage of the new federal highway funding bill 
decreased sales of permanent crash cushions  truck mounted attenuator tma products  and barrels were partially offset by increased sales of parts 
sales of permanent crash cushions decreased  sales of tma products decreased  and sales of parts increased 
sales for the protect and direct segment for fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal sales increased across the company s protect and direct product lines with the exception of sales of parts  sand filled barrels and the freezefree anti icing system 
sales of tma products increased and sales of permanent crash cushions increased 
inform net sales for the company s inform segment for fiscal increased  to  from  for fiscal this was primarily due to the acquisitions of ust and peek traffic  which added  in net sales for excluding the two recent acquisitions  net sales for the inform segment decreased  or  due to lower sales of advanced sensing equipment and weather systems 
sales for fiscal included two particularly large contracts totaling  for weather and traffic sensing stations to ohio and variable message signs to california 
ust has been affected by ongoing state and municipal budgetary issues  which has resulted in depressed order flows and sales levels significantly lower than planned 
sales for the inform segment for fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal primarily due to the acquisition of ust in may and surface systems  inc ssi in august these two acquisitions added  in sales for fiscal not comparable to the prior year 
excluding these acquisitions  sales for this segment increased due to higher sales across the company s inform product lines 
the growth in sales of advanced sensing systems and variable message signs was due to shipments of two large contracts  including  in ohio to supply weather and traffic sensing systems and  in variable message signs and arrowboards in california 
geographic international sales for fiscal increased by  or  to  compared to  for last year 
the acquisitions of ust and peek traffic contributed  in international net sales for fiscal domestic sales for fiscal increased to  from  the acquisitions of ust and peek traffic contributed  in domestic net sales in fiscal offset by decreased domestic sales  excluding acquisitions  for both segments 
for fiscal  the company s increase in sales was helped by strong international sales which increased  or to  in compared to  for of the increase   was due to an increase in sales of the triton barrier product in australia related to new legislation passed in australia requiring positive protection for all highway work zones 
domestic sales increased in fiscal due principally to the acquisition of ust 
excluding acquisitions  domestic sales for increased over the prior year due to the sales increases across both segments mentioned earlier 
gross profit margin the company s gross profit margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal due principally to lower gross profit margins at ust and peek traffic 
the gross profit margin for the protect and direct segment decreased somewhat due to volume inefficiencies associated with the lower level of sales offset by a positive change in product sales mix with decreased sales of the lower margin tma product line 
the gross profit margin for the inform segment decreased primarily due to low gross profit margins at ust and peek traffic as those gross profit margins are less than the segment s historical gross profit margin 
in addition  the gross profit margin at ust was lower than planned due to decreased sales volumes 
excluding ust and peek traffic results  the gross profit margin for the inform segment was slightly lower than fiscal primarily due to volume inefficiencies associated with the lower level of sales 
the gross profit margin for fiscal was compared to for the modest increase in gross profit margin was due to an increase in gross profit margin for the protect and direct segment partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit margin for the inform segment 
the increase in the gross profit margin for the protect and direct segment was due to volume efficiencies associated with the higher level of sales offset by an adverse change in product sales mix with higher sales of the lower margin tma product line 
the decrease in the gross profit margin for the inform segment was primarily due to an adverse change in product sales mix with increased sales of lower margin large contract shipments 
also contributing to the decline in gross profit margin for the inform segment was the impact of the acquisitions of ust and ssi as those gross profit margins are lower than the segment s historical gross profit margin 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased  or  to  from  for fiscal due to the inclusion of ust and peek traffic which added  for fiscal  not comparable to fiscal excluding ust and peek traffic results  selling and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal primarily related to decreased selling expenses due to lower sales volume in the protect and direct and inform segments 
selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to for fiscal compared to for as ust and peek traffic have lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales than the company s historical percentage 
selling and administrative expenses for increased  or  to  from  for the increase was due to the increase in sales and to the inclusion of selling and administrative expenses from ust and ssi which added approximately  in expenses for selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to of sales for from of sales for this decrease in the percentage of sales was due to the fixed component of many of the company s expenses 
also contributing to the decrease in percentage was the acquisition of ust with lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales than the company s historical percentage 
asset impairment charges the prolonged delay in the passage of new federal highway funding legislation as well as ongoing state and municipal budget issues have had a significant negative impact on the company as a whole 
in addition  ust operating results have been much lower than expected  although the company is currently pursuing the integration of ust and peek traffic in order to improve profitability 
as a result of these factors and the company s impairment review in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the carrying amounts of certain long lived assets were no longer recoverable based on estimated future operating cash flows to be generated by those assets  which were lower than previously projected 
the company recorded asset impairment charges in the inform segment of  or  net of income tax benefits  or per diluted share 
the charges included  for goodwill relating to ust  ssi and nu metrics   for intangible assets and  for fixed assets 
research and development research and development expenditures were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increase of  was due primarily to the inclusion of research and development expenditures for ust and peek traffic 
the company continued to invest in development projects for new applications as well as upgrades and modifications to existing products 
research and development expenditures were  for compared to  for the expenditures in included enhancements to the company s existing line of freezefree anti icing systems  tma products and the triton barrier product 
the company also successfully tested its quadguard cen family of crash cushions under european standards at speeds of  and km h and at all hazard widths 
operating profit the operating loss was  for fiscal  including the asset impairment charges of  compared to operating profit of  for fiscal operating profit for the protect and direct segment decreased  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the operating loss for the inform segment was  including the asset impairment charges of  compared to operating profit of  for fiscal operating profit increased to  in from  for operating profit for the protect and direct segment increased  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal operating profit for the inform segment increased  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal interest expense interest expense for fiscal increased to  from  last year 
the increase was due to the higher level of average long term debt since the acquisitions of ust in may and peek traffic in december the interest rate on the company s collateralized credit agreement is based on prime or libor and a fixed rate  plus a margin 
the weighted average rate was as of june  compared to a weighted average rate of as of june  the company expects interest rates to increase during fiscal to an estimated average rate of 
interest expense was  for compared to  for interest expense decreased due to the lower average level of long term debt outstanding and to lower interest rates for other expense the company recorded a loss on disposal of fixed assets of  in fiscal in connection with the relocation of the company s chicago office 
provision for income taxes the income tax benefit for fiscal was  this includes  relating to the asset impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter and a  income tax tax benefit related to the favorable settlement of a tax audit recorded during the third quarter 
excluding the impact of these benefits  income taxes reflect a effective tax rate 
the company expects to provide for income taxes at a rate of for fiscal  primarily due to higher state taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate for was compared to an effective income tax rate of for the decrease in the effective rate was due in part to the continued expected utilization of certain tax planning strategies 
net earnings loss the net loss for fiscal was  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings of  or per diluted share  for included in the net loss for fiscal are the asset impairment charges of  net of taxes  or per diluted share 
earnings from continuing operations for were  or per diluted share  compared to  or per diluted share  for net earnings were  or per diluted share  for the year compared to  or per diluted share  for net earnings for included a gain from discontinued operations of  or per diluted share  which was net of income tax provisions of financial condition liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings from banks 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of  as of june  and access to additional funds under a bank credit agreement which currently expires as of may  the company believes that this credit agreement is an important source of liquidity 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility and a term loan agreement with million outstanding at june  principal on the term loan is payable quarterly in installments of  plus interest 
the agreement contains both fixed and floating interest rate options  at the prime rate or libor rate  plus a margin 
the credit agreement also contains affirmative and negative covenants including requirements that the company meet certain consolidated financial criteria  including minimum levels of consolidated net worth  ebitda as defined in the agreement and capital expenditures 
dividend payments are limited by a maximum amount outstanding against the revolving credit facility of million  minus the amount of such dividend payment 
the covenants also limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness  acquisitions  liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
the agreement may be renewed one additional year on each anniversary date upon mutual consent of the company and the banks 
effective june  and during september  the company entered into two amendments to the credit agreement  modifying certain covenants  pledging the company s assets as collateral and reducing the maximum amount of availability under the revolving credit facility to million to avoid the occurrence of events of default relating to certain covenants and financial ratios 
the company is currently in compliance with its debt covenants as of june  however  the company s ability to remain in compliance in the future is dependent upon the company s future performance and may be affected in part by events beyond its control  including the prolonged delay in the passage of new federal highway legislation 
while the company currently expects to be in compliance with the current agreement as amended  there can be no assurance that the company will generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to remain in compliance or that it will be able to obtain future amendments to the agreement  if necessary  to avoid a default 
in the event of a default  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the agreement  million as of june   to be due and currently payable and the company would negotiate a new credit agreement 
however  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain a new credit agreement with satisfactory terms and conditions within an acceptable time period 
the company s outstanding borrowings were  or of total capitalization  as of june   of which  was outstanding related to the bank credit facility 
this compares to  or of total capitalization  as of june  the increase primarily relates to the acquisition of peek traffic in december for which the company borrowed  against the revolving credit facility 
cash flows cash flows provided by operations were  during fiscal this compares with  in fiscal and  in fiscal in each of the past three years  cash flow from operations was primarily derived from earnings before non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization and asset impairment charges 
the decrease in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal reflects increased working capital  in particular  an investment in working capital at ust through the payment of accounts payable and accrued expenses in the first few months after the acquisition in may however  working capital decreased through reductions in accounts receivable and inventory in fiscal due to the decreased level of sales 
investing activities used cash of  during fiscal  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal expenditures during fiscal included  for the purchase of peek traffic in december and  for capital expenditures 
financing activities provided cash of  during fiscal  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the majority of the cash provided through financing activities in all three years was used to acquire businesses 
during fiscal  the company borrowed a net  against its outstanding revolving credit facility primarily for the acquisition of peek traffic 
the company also paid  in quarterly payments on the term loan due in connection with the acquisition of ust and  on other notes payable 
the company received cash of  from the exercise of common stock options 
the payment of the company s semi annual cash dividend used cash of  the company has paid a semi annual dividend since and plans to continue to do so 
however  payment of the semi annual dividend is subject to limitations in the company s credit agreement 
for  the company anticipates needing  in cash for capital expenditures 
the company may also need additional cash as it considers acquiring businesses that complement its existing operations 
also  the company may require additional investments in working capital to maintain growth 
the company may also need additional funds to repurchase its own common stock from time to time 
these expenditures will be financed either through the company s cash on hand  cash generated from its operations or from borrowings available under the company s bank credit facility 
the company believes its existing cash  cash generated from operations and funds available under its existing credit facility are sufficient for all planned operating and capital requirements in the near term 
if needed and available on favorable terms  the company may also enter into other debt or equity financing arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company is subject to certain debt obligations  guarantees  commitments and contingent liabilities further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the company s contractual obligations to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  as of june  total less than year years years more than years dollar amounts in thousands long term debt note      operating leases note     minimum royalty payments note  total      future outlook the company has been affected by the general slowdown in us highway safety construction spending for the company s products 
the company believes this is due principally to the prolonged delay in the passage of new federal highway legislation as well as revenue shortfalls and budget constraints at the state level 
the previous highway funding bill  tea  expired in september  but has been extended several times 
the timing of the passage of the new highway legislation is uncertain 
until new legislation is passed  the transportation safety allotment in federal and state budgets will continue to be uncertain  and the company believes this uncertainty will continue to negatively impact spending on the products and services offered by the company 
the company believes that the passage of the new six year reauthorization bill may occur by the end of calendar  however  the company does not anticipate realizing the benefit of the bill s passage until the later half of fiscal the substandard sales volumes and operating losses at ust are expected to continue into the first half of fiscal the company is developing a plan to rationalize portions of the ust and peek traffic operations which will include integrating product offerings  outsourcing non critical component parts and focusing manufacturing facilities to obtain greater synergies 
although the company is currently refining estimates related to the plan  the total projected annual savings could be several million dollars with costs estimated at approximately one million dollars 
the full benefit of projected annual cost savings is not expected to be realized until fiscal the company experiences fluctuation in its gross profit margin from quarter to quarter primarily due to sales volume related to seasonality  variability in product mix and changes in the competitive environment 
in addition  the company has acquired complementary businesses over the past several years and  as part of its strategy  may continue to acquire complementary businesses 
the gross profit margins of certain acquired product lines are lower than the company s historical gross profit margin  which is adversely affecting the company s gross profit margin 
the company is also experiencing rigorous competition in its variable message sign and weather sensing system product lines 
the company does not believe these trends will improve in the near future 
significant accounting policies and critical estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
management s estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in addition  certain normal and recurring estimates are made including estimates in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation reserves  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and health care liabilities 
these estimates are made using management s best judgment given relevant factors and available data 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
note to the company s june  consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies  methods and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
there have been no material changes in accounting policies  methods and estimates used by management 
in the opinion of management  the company does not have any individual accounting policy or use any individual estimate that is critical to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
in most instances  the company must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under us gaap 
the company believes the following significant accounting policies and methods used by the company are the most important to the presentation of the company s financial statements revenue recognition revenues  net of sales incentives  are recognized when either services have been rendered or both title and risk of loss of products have been transferred to unaffiliated customers 
additionally  the company ensures that collection of the resulting receivable is probable  persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  and the revenue is fixed or determinable 
provision for estimated uncollectible amounts is made based upon management s analysis of sales returns and bad debts 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
actual costs are used to value raw materials and supplies 
standard costs  which approximate actual costs  are used to value finished goods and work in process 
standard costs include raw materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management s analysis of inventory levels  ages and salability 
long lived assets long lived assets include such items as goodwill  patents  product rights  other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  the company assesses the possibility of obsolescence  demand  new technology  competition  and other pertinent economic factors and trends that may have an impact on the value or remaining lives of these assets 
amortized long lived assets including amortized intangible assets and property  plant and equipment held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in relation to future undiscounted cash flows of underlying asset groups 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
fair values of amortized long lived assets are determined based upon the performance of a third party fair value appraisal 
patents and other finite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line or systematic method over the life of the patent or intangible asset 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually 
the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value in a one step analysis 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value 
the goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level and is a two step analysis 
first  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its book value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  the company performs a hypothetical purchase price allocation based on the reporting unit s fair value to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value  the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
fair values are determined with the help of a third party appraisal firm using present value techniques 
as discussed further in note to the company s june  consolidated financial statements  the company performed an impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  the company recorded non cash asset impairment charges of  relating to goodwill  other indefinite lived intangible assets and amortized long lived assets of the inform segment 
the impairment review is highly judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions have a significant impact on the amount of any impairment charge recorded 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow methods and are dependent upon assumptions of future sales trends  market conditions and cash flows of each reporting unit over several years 
actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those previously forecasted 
other significant assumptions include growth rates and the discount rate applicable to future cash flows 
the impact of these estimates and assumptions on impairment testing of goodwill is particularly critical for the company s inform segment with  of the company s  of goodwill recorded in the company s june  balance sheet 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to the extent that any future tax benefits are not expected to be fully realized  such future tax benefits are reduced by a valuation allowance 
realization of deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income so that the assets will be realized 
the factors that the company considers in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
the company expects the deferred tax assets currently recorded to be fully realizable  however there can be no assurance that an increased valuation allowance would not need to be recorded in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments in the form of non trading interest rate swaps 
the objective of the swap is to fix the interest rate on certain variable rate debt to stabilize interest rates and to more effectively balance the company s long term borrowing costs and interest rate risk 
during july  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to set a fixed interest rate relating to million of its outstanding debt at variable interest rates 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the amount of long term debt outstanding as of june  and was  and  respectively 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have adversely affected the company s and net earnings and cash flows by approximately  and  respectively 
the majority of the company s business is transacted in us dollars and the us dollar is considered the primary currency for the majority of the company s operations 
although the company continues to evaluate derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate changes  the company did not hold such derivatives during or assets  liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies for transaction purposes are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
however  there were no significant transaction gains or losses during  or and the company does not believe it is currently exposed to any material risk of loss from currency exchange fluctuations
