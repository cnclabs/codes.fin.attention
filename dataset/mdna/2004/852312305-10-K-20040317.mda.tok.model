item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results 
item business general staar surgical company develops  manufactures and distributes worldwide products used by ophthalmologists and other eye care professionals to improve or correct vision in patients with cataracts  refractive conditions  and glaucoma 
originally incorporated in california in  staar surgical company reincorporated in delaware in unless the context indicates otherwise we  us or the company  refers to staar surgical company and its consolidated subsidiaries 
cataract surgery 
our main products are foldable silicone and collamer intraocular lenses iols used after minimally invasive small incision cataract extraction 
over the years  we have expanded our range of products for use in cataract surgery to include toric silicone iols to treat astigmatic abnormalities  staarvisc ii  a viscoelastic material  the staar sonicwave phacoemulsification system  and cruise control  a disposable filter which allows for a significantly faster  cleaner phacoemulsification procedure and is compatible with all phacoemulsification equipment utilizing venturi pump technologies 
currently  the majority of our revenues are generated from these products 
refractive surgery 
in the area of refractive surgery  we have used our biocompatible collamer material to develop and manufacture the visian icl icl and the visian ticl ticl to treat refractive disorders such as myopia near sightedness  hyperopia far sightedness and astigmatism 
these disorders of vision affect a large proportion of the population 
unlike the intraocular lens iol  which replaces a cataract patient s cloudy lens  these products are designed to work with the patient s natural lens to correct refractive errors 
the company s goal is to establish the custom made icl and ticl as the next paradigm shift in refractive surgery  making the products the dominant revenue generators for the company over the next four to five years 
the icl has not yet been approved for use in the united states 
on october   the us food and drug administration s the fda ophthalmic devices panel recommended that  with certain conditions  the fda approve the icl for use in correcting myopia in the range of to diopters and reducing myopia in the range of to diopters 
if approved  we believe that the icl will have a significant market as an alternative to lasik and other available refractive surgical procedures and will likely replace cataract surgery products as staar s largest source of revenue 
the icl is approved for use in the countries comprising the european union and in korea and canada 
the ticl is in clinical trials in the united states  and is approved for use in the countries comprising the european union 
glaucoma surgery 
we have also developed the aquaflow collagen glaucoma drainage device the aqua flow device  as an alternative to current methods of treating open angle glaucoma 
the aquaflow device is implanted in the sclera the white of the eye  using a minimally invasive procedure  for the purpose of reducing intraocular pressure 
within each of these segments  we also sell other instruments  devices and equipment that we manufacture or that are manufactured by others in the ophthalmic industry 
in general  these products complement staar s proprietary product range and allow us to compete more effectively 

table of contents strategy our overall mission is to develop  manufacture and market visual implants to improve outcomes for patients and make surgery simpler and safer for the physician 
in pursuit of that mission we pioneered minimally invasive cataract surgery by introducing the folding intraocular lens and the cartridge delivery system 
we have recently built on that success to enter the field of refractive surgery with the visian icl  which is available for the treatment of refractive errors in much of the world and currently under review by the fda for use in the united states 
for the past three years  the strategic focus of our new management team  led by our ceo david bailey  has been to strengthen and revitalize the company 
this was achieved through the execution of key strategies that included the following strengthening management at both the executive and board levels  developing corporate governance that is more responsive to stockholder interests  improving cash flow  reducing costs  improving gross margins  closing unprofitable facilities and consolidating manufacturing  resolving several lingering lawsuits by determining the best reasonably achievable outcome and aggressively prosecuting or defending the cases  or settling  as appropriate  and collecting on indebtedness to staar of former executive officers and directors 
with a strong foundation firmly in place as a result of those initiatives  the company has shifted its focus to strategies designed to enhance future profitability of the company and provide maximum stockholder value 
those strategies include the following building our franchise in refractive implant surgery 
we have experienced steady growth in worldwide sales of our innovative refractive implant  the visian icl 
we seek to build on our leadership in this technology to create a strong franchise for the visian icl  which we expect to account for an increasing portion of revenue in the future 
to achieve this we will pursue the following goals fda approval for the visian icl  completion of the visian toric icl clinical trial to lay the foundation for fda approval  approval for the visian icl and the visian toric icl in new international markets  gaining market share within the european union 
revitalizing our core cataract implant business 
we intend to rebuild us market share for our cataract implants through the following steps increasing awareness among ophthalmologists of the advantages of our proprietary collamer material as an alternative to either silicone or acrylic lenses  improving the lens insertion technology for all of our cataract implants  and expanding on our preloaded cartridge technology to make it available for all of our lenses and establishing it as the standard of care 
improve regulatory compliance 
we are launching programs to reinforce regulatory compliance throughout our organization  and to put systems in place to ensure the highest standards of quality and medical and scientific integrity in our research and development  testing  production  reporting and 
table of contents commercialization of our implants 
we have accelerated our efforts to meet these long term goals in response to an fda warning letter received on december   which identified deficiencies in our compliance with fda quality systems regulations  by undertaking the following actions engaging private consulting firms to audit systems and procedures throughout our organization and recommend both specific and comprehensive changes  bifurcating the regulatory and compliance functions from the research and development functions to allow for more concentrated focus in each area and recruiting a new vice president of research and development  and recruiting additional staff with primary responsibility for regulatory compliance 
increase our emphasis on marketing 
like most medical device manufacturers  we have relied on a force of specialized sales representatives to introduce our products to ophthalmologists 
we believe that we can increase the readiness of ophthalmologists to adopt our innovative products and undergo the training necessary to use them by branding and other centralized marketing initiatives 
in particular  we believe that the visian icl  the visian toric icl and collamer have the potential to be valuable and recognized brands  and we intend to increase our efforts and expenditures to establish their brand identity 
grow our glaucoma franchise 
we believe the aquaflow device represents a safer and more effective glaucoma filtration surgery than conventional or laser procedures in more common use 
we will continue our efforts to educate professionals about the potential advantages of aquaflow technology and to build the base of surgeons trained to implant it 
strengthen training 
we intend to strengthen our global training programs to provide a more ready pathway for introducing and gaining physician acceptance for our new products 
financial and other information highlights among the significant events for staar in were the following we settled our employment dispute with mr 
richard leza  a former officer on february   and on april   a shareholder derivative suit filed against staar and certain named directors and officers in the state of delaware was dismissed 
these were the last of the significant litigation matters confronting us when current management began its tenure 
on june   we completed a private sale of  shares of the company s common stock at a price per share of 
the sale yielded net proceeds to us of approximately  which was used to repay indebtedness and for working capital 
applying some of the proceeds of the private sale of securities  we paid down approximately million in notes payable and cancelled our line of credit with our domestic lender 
on october   the ophthalmic devices panel of the center for devices and radiological health cdrh voted to recommend that the visian icl be approved with conditions for use in correcting myopia in the range of to diopters and reducing myopia in the range of to diopters 
during the year  we integrated the phacoemulsification manufacturing and repair activities of our subsidiary  circuit tree medical  into our monrovia  california facility and wrote down approximately million in associated net capitalized patent costs 
during the year  we collected million in notes receivable from our former officers and directors and reversed million in reserves against the notes 
on december   we received a warning letter from the fda identifying deficiencies in our compliance with medical device regulations 
until the deficiencies are addressed to its satisfaction  the fda will not grant final approval to the visian icl  and we may face fda restrictions on our 
table of contents established domestic lines of business 
we are taking immediate steps to remedy the deficiencies identified by the fda and to improve systems and procedures throughout our organization to ensure we meet or exceed regulatory standards in the future 
revenues for were million  an increase of million  or  from net loss for amounted to million  or 
per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  reported in significant operational matters that affected net earnings for included non recurring charges totaling million and a million valuation allowance recorded against the company s deferred tax assets partially offset by a tax benefit recorded for a carryback claim of approximately million 
excluding the impact of these charges  the net loss for was million or per share 
financial information about segments and geographic areas the company has expanded its marketing focus beyond the cataract surgery market to include the refractive surgery and glaucoma markets 
however  during the cataract segment continued to account for the majority of the company s revenues and  thus  the company operates as one business segment for financial reporting purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for financial information about product lines and operations in geographic areas 
background the human eye is a specialized sensory organ capable of receiving visual images that are transmitted to the visual center in the brain 
the main parts of the eye are the cornea  the iris  the lens  the retina  and the trabecular meshwork 
the cornea is the clear window in the front of the eye through which light first passes 
the iris is a muscular curtain located behind the cornea which opens and closes to regulate the amount of light entering the eye through the pupil  an opening at the center of the iris 
the lens is a clear structure located behind the iris that changes shape to better focus light to the retina  located in the back of the eye 
the retina is a layer of nerve tissue consisting of millions of light receptors called rods and cones  which receive the light image and transmit it to the brain via the optic nerve 
the anterior chamber of the eye  located in front of the iris  is filled with a watery fluid called the aqueous humour  while the portion of the eye behind the lens is filled with a jelly like material called the vitreous humour 
the trabecular meshwork  a drainage channel located between the iris and the surrounding white portion of the eye  maintains a normal pressure in the anterior chamber of the eye by draining excess aqueous humour 
the eye can be affected by common visual disorders  disease or trauma 
the most prevalent ocular disorders or diseases are cataracts and glaucoma 
cataract formation is generally an age related situation that involves the hardening and loss of transparency of the natural crystalline lens  impairing visual acuity 
glaucoma is a progressive ocular disease that manifests itself through increased intraocular pressure 
this  in turn  may result in damage to the optic disc and a decrease of the visual field 
untreated  progressive glaucoma may result in blindness 
refractive disorders include myopia  hyperopia  astigmatism and presbyopia 
myopia and hyperopia are caused by either overly curved or flat corneas which result in improper focusing of light on the retina 
they are also known as near sightedness and far sightedness  respectively 
astigmatism is characterized by an irregularly shaped cornea resulting in blurred vision 
presbyopia is an age related condition caused by the loss of elasticity of the natural crystalline lens  reducing the eye s ability to accommodate or adjust for varying distances 

table of contents principal products our products are designed to improve patient outcomes  minimize patient risk and discomfort  and simplify ophthalmic procedures or post operative care for the surgeon and the patient 
intraocular lenses iols and related cataract treatment products 
we produce and market a line of foldable iols for use in minimally invasive cataract surgical procedures 
our iols can be folded or otherwise deformed  and therefore can be implanted into the eye through an incision as small as mm 
once inserted  the iol unfolds naturally into the capsular bag that previously held the cataractous lens 
our foldable iols are manufactured from both our proprietary collamer material and silicone 
both materials are offered in two differently configured styles  the single piece plate haptic design and the three piece design where the optic is combined with polyimide loop haptics 
the selection of one style over the other is primarily based on the preference of the ophthalmologist 
sales of foldable iols accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the fiscal year  of total revenues for the fiscal year and approximately of total revenues for the fiscal year 
we have developed and currently market globally the toric iol  a toric version of our single piece silicone iol  which is specifically designed for patients with pre existing astigmatism 
the toric iol is the only iol that has fda approval to include in its labeling that it improves uncorrected visual acuity 
the toric iol is the first refractive product we offered in the us  and is a significant addition to our line of cataract products 
in may  the centers for medicare and medicaid cms  granted our application to have the toric iol designated as a new technology 
this designation allows ambulatory surgical centers to receive an additional per lens above the standard medicare reimbursement rate through may as part of our approach to providing complementary products for use in minimally invasive cataract surgery  we also market staarvisc ii  a viscoelastic material  the staar sonicwave phacoemulsification system  and cruise control  a disposable filter which allows for a significantly faster  cleaner phacoemulsification procedure and is compatible with all phacoemulsification equipment utilizing venturi pump technologies 
we also sell other related instruments  devices  surgical packs and equipment that we manufacture or that are manufactured by others in the ophthalmic industry 
aquaflow collagen glaucoma drainage device 
our aquaflow device is surgically implanted in the outer tissues of the eye to maintain a space that allows increased drainage of intraocular fluid so as to reduce intraocular pressure 
it is made of collagen  a porous material that is compatible with human tissue and facilitates drainage of excess eye fluid 
the aquaflow device is specifically designed for patients with open angled glaucoma  which is the most prevalent type of glaucoma 
in contrast to conventional and laser glaucoma surgeries  implantation of the aquaflow device does not require penetration of the anterior chamber of the eye 
instead  a small flap of the outer eye is folded back and a portion of the sclera and trabecular meshwork is removed 
the aquaflow device is placed above the remaining trabecular meshwork and schlemm s canal and the outer flap is refolded into place 
the device swells  creating a space as the eye heals 
it is absorbed into the surrounding tissue within six months to nine months after implantation  leaving the open space and possibly creating new fluid collector channels 
the to minute surgical procedure to implant the aquaflow device is performed under local or topical anesthesia  typically on an outpatient basis 
we believe that the compatibility of the human eye with the material from which the aquaflow device is made and the minimally invasive nature of the surgery offer several advantages over existing surgical procedures  including reduced risk of surgical complications compared to trabeculectomy  a longer term solution than medications  
table of contents predictable outcomes  making case management easier and less time consuming  less need for pressure reducing medications  enabling the patient to have minimally invasive laser surgery if further pressure reduction becomes necessary over the long term  and cost effectiveness compared to surgical and medication alternatives 
we believe the aquaflow device is an attractive product for ophthalmic surgeons who have traditionally referred their patients to glaucoma specialists  managed care and health maintenance organizations and group purchasing organizations that desire to control their costs and at the same time provide their customers with a higher standard of health care  and less developed countries which lack the resources and infrastructure to provide the continuous treatments mandated by drug therapy 
while we believe this market is very conservative  there is a continuing interest in learning the surgical procedure to implant the aquaflow device 
adoption by ophthalmic surgeons  however  will be dependent upon the rate at which they learn to perform the surgical procedure or the development of instrumentation to simplify the procedure 
in july  we received pre market approval for the aquaflow device from the fda 
refractive correction visian icl icls 
icls are phakic iols lenses implanted into the eye in order to correct refractive disorders such as myopia  hyperopia and astigmatism 
the icl is capable of correcting a wide range of refractive disorders from low to severe conditions 
the icl is folded and implanted into the eye behind the iris and in front of the natural lens using minimally invasive surgical techniques similar to implanting an iol during cataract surgery  except that the human lens is not removed 
the surgical procedure to implant the icl is typically performed with topical anesthesia on an outpatient basis 
visual recovery is within one to hours 
we believe the icl will complement current refractive technologies and allow refractive surgeons to expand their treatment range and customer base 
the icl for myopia received the ce mark in august allowing the company to sell the product in each of the countries comprising the european union eu 
approvals for canada were received in july and korea in april the company has submitted for approval in taiwan and australia and those files are pending 
the canon staar company  inc  our joint venture in japan  began clinical trials for the icl in the second quarter of in the united states  the food and drug administration s ophthalmic devices panel recommended in october that the company s icl be approved with conditions for the correction of myopia in the range of to diopters and for the reduction of myopia from to diopters 
however  there can be no assurance that the fda will follow the recommendations of the ophthalmic devices panel 

table of contents the toric icl received the ce mark in november and submissions are currently pending in canada and korea 
the company initiated clinical trials in the united states in q and completed enrollment in february the toric ide cohort consists of patients with myopia in the range of d to d and astigmatism in the range of d to d 
a one year post operative follow up of each patient is required 
the hyperopic icl received the ce mark in august  is approved for sale in canada  and is currently in clinical trials in the united states 
sources and availability of raw materials the company uses a wide range of raw materials in the production of our products 
most of the raw materials and components are purchased from external suppliers 
some of our raw materials are single sourced due to regulatory constraints  cost effectiveness  availability  and quality and vendor reliability issues 
many of our components are standard parts and are available from a variety of sources although we do not typically pursue regulatory and quality certification of multiple sources of supply 
with the exception of our silicone material  we do not believe that the loss of any existing external supply source would have material adverse effect on us 
the proprietary collagen based raw material used to manufacture our iols  icls and the aquaflow device is internally sole sourced from one of our facilities in california 
if the supply of these collagen based raw materials is disrupted we know of no alternative supplier  and therefore  any such disruption could result in our inability to manufacture the products and would have a material adverse effect on the company 
patents  trademarks and licenses we strive to protect our investment in the research  development  manufacturing and marketing of our products through the use of patents  licenses  trademarks  and copyrights 
we own or have rights to a number of patents  licenses  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and other intellectual property directly related and important to our business 
as of january   we owned approximately united states and foreign patents and had approximately patent applications pending 
we believe that our patents are important to our business 
of significant importance to the company are the patents  licenses  and technology rights surrounding our visian icl icl and collamer material 
in  we were granted an exclusive royalty bearing license to manufacture  use  and sell icls in the united states  europe  latin america  africa  and asia using the uniquely biocompatible collamer material 
the collamer material is also used in certain of our iols 
we have also acquired or applied for various patents and licenses related to our aqua flow device  our phacoemulsification system  our insertion devices  and other technologies of the company 
patents for individual products extend for varying periods of time according to the date a patent application is filed or a patent is granted and the term of patent protection available in the jurisdiction granting the patent 
the scope of protection provided by a patent can vary significantly from country to country 
our strategy is to develop patent portfolios for our research and development projects in order to obtain market exclusivity for our products in our major markets 
although the expiration of a patent for a product normally results in the loss of market exclusivity  we may continue to derive commercial benefits from these products 
we routinely monitor the activities of our competitors and other third parties with respect to their use of intellectual property  including considering whether or not to assert our patents where we believe they are being infringed 
worldwide  all of our major products are sold under trademarks we consider to be important to our business 
the scope and duration of trademark protection varies widely throughout the world 
in some countries  trademark protection continues only as long as the mark is used 
other countries require registration of trademarks and the payment of registration fees 
trademark registrations are generally for fixed but renewable terms 

table of contents confidentiality arrangements 
we protect our proprietary technology  in part  through confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
our confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants generally contain standard provisions requiring those individuals to assign to staar  without additional consideration  inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by staar  subject to customary exceptions 
seasonality we experience some seasonality in demand for our products with sales in the third quarter generally being the lowest due to the impact of summer vacations on elective surgeries 
distribution and customers we market our products to a variety of health care providers  including surgical centers  hospitals  managed care providers  health maintenance organizations  group purchasing organizations and government facilities 
the primary user of our products is the ophthalmologist 
no material part of our business  taken as a whole  is dependant upon a single or a few customers 
we maintain direct distribution in the united states  canada  germany and australia 
sales efforts in germany and australia are primarily supported through a direct sales force 
sales efforts in the united states and canada are primarily supported through a network of independent manufacturers representatives 
the representatives are compensated through the payment of commissions based on sales and may represent manufacturers other than staar  although not in competing products 
in all other countries where we do business  we sell through independent distributors 
we support the sales efforts of our agents  employees and distributors through the activities of our internal marketing departments 
sales efforts are supplemented through the use of promotional materials  educational courses  speakers programs  participation in trade shows and technical presentations 
the dollar amount of the company s backlog orders is not significant in relation to total annual sales 
the company generally keeps sufficient inventory on hand to ship product when ordered 
competitive conditions competition in the ophthalmic medical device field is intense and characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change 
development by competitors of new or improved products  processes or technologies may make our products obsolete or less competitive 
we will be required to devote continued efforts and significant financial resources to enhance our existing products and to develop new products for the ophthalmic industry 
we believe our primary competition in the development and sale of products used to surgically correct cataracts  namely foldable iols and phacoemulsification machines  includes alcon  advanced medical optics amo  and bausch lomb 
these competitors have been established for longer periods of time than we have and have significantly greater resources than we have  including greater name recognition  larger sales operations and greater ability to finance research and development and proceedings for regulatory approval 
our primary competition in the development and sale of products used to treat glaucoma is from pharmaceutical companies  primarily because drug therapy is  and for years has been  the accepted treatment for glaucoma 
the portion of this market held by medical devices used to treat glaucoma is insignificant at present 
we believe that merck company  inc  pfizer  novartis  alcon  allergan and bausch lomb are the largest providers of drugs used to treat glaucoma 
there are also other devices under development by others to be used in conjunction with a non penetrating deep sclerectomy for the surgical management of glaucoma 

table of contents our icl will face significant competition in the marketplace from products that improve or correct refractive conditions  such as corrective eyeglasses and external contact lenses  and particularly from providers of conventional and laser refractive surgical procedures 
these are products long established in the marketplace and familiar to patients in need of refractive correction 
furthermore  corrective eyeglasses and external contact lenses are more easily obtained  in that a prescription is usually written following a routine eye examination in a doctor s office  without admitting the patient to a hospital or surgery center 
we believe that the following providers of laser surgical procedures comprise our primary competition in the marketplace for patients requiring refractive corrections alcon  bausch lomb  visx  nidek and wave light all market excimer lasers for corneal refractive surgery 
approval of custom ablation  along with the addition of wavefront technology  has increased awareness of corneal refractive surgery by patients and practitioners 
conductive keratoplasty ck by refractec competes for the hyperopic market for to diopters 
in the phakic iol market  the icl faces the ophtec verisyse or artisan iol to be distributed in the united states by amo  ciba vision s prl manufactured by medennium  as well as phakic iols under investigation by ophthalmic innovations international  tekia  inc  alcon  inc  and thinoptx 
regulatory requirements our products are subject to regulatory approval in the united states and in foreign countries 
the following discussion outlines the various kinds of reviews to which our products or production facilities may be subject 
clinical regulatory requirements in the united states 
under the federal food  drug cosmetic act as amended by the food and drug administration modernization act of the act  the fda has the authority to adopt regulations that set standards for medical devices  require proof of safety and effectiveness prior to marketing devices which the fda believes require pre market clearance  require test data approval prior to clinical evaluation of human use  permit detailed inspections of device manufacturing facilities  establish good manufacturing practices that must be followed in device manufacture  require reporting of serious product defects to the fda  and prohibit device exports that do not comply with the act unless they comply with established foreign regulations  do not conflict with foreign laws  and the fda and the health agency of the importing country determine export is not contrary to public health 
most of our products are medical devices intended for human use within the meaning of the act and  therefore  are subject to fda regulation 
the fda establishes complex procedures for compliance based upon regulations that designate devices as class i general controls  such as compliance with labeling and record keeping requirements  class ii performance standards in addition to general controls or class iii pre market approval application pmaa before commercial marketing 
class iii devices are the most extensively regulated because the fda has determined they are life supporting  are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of health  or present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury 
the effect of assigning a device to class iii is to require each manufacturer to submit to the fda a pmaa that includes information on the safety and effectiveness of the device 
a medical device that is substantially equivalent to a directly related medical device previously in commerce may be eligible for the fda s abbreviated pre market notification k review process 
fda 
table of contents k clearance is a grandfather process 
as such  fda clearance does not imply that the safety  reliability and effectiveness of the medical device has been approved or validated by the fda  but merely means that the medical device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared commercially related medical device 
the review period and fda determination as to substantial equivalence should be made within days of submission of a k application  unless additional information or clarification or clinical studies are requested or required by the fda 
as a practical matter  the review process and fda determination may take longer than days 
our iols and icls are class iii devices  our aquaflow devices  phacoemulsification equipment  ultrasonic cutting tips and surgical packs are class ii devices  and our lens injectors are class i devices 
we have received fda pre market approval for our iols including the toric and the collamer iols and aquaflow device and fda k clearance for our phacoemulsification equipment  lens injectors  and ultrasonic cutting tips 
as a manufacturer of medical devices  our manufacturing processes and facilities are subject to continuing review by the fda and various state agencies to ensure compliance with good manufacturing practices 
these agencies inspect our facilities from time to time to determine whether we are in compliance with various regulations relating to manufacturing practices  validation  testing  quality control and product labeling 
in  during a series of such inspections  the fda issued a warning letter to us relating to the reporting of adverse events and alleged violations of fda s quality system regulations 
we met with the fda to discuss the issues and are actively working on resolving them 
until these issues are resolved  the icl cannot be granted approval for sale in the us market 
resolving these issues in a timely manner is also critical to the ongoing commercialization of existing  approved products 
we are also subject to regulation by the local air pollution control district and the united states environmental protection agency as a result of some of the chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
medical device laws and regulations similar to those described above are also in effect in some of the countries to which we export our products 
these range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our medical device products to requests for product data or certifications 
clinical regulatory requirements in foreign countries 
there is a wide variation in the approval or clearance requirements necessary to market medical products in foreign countries 
the requirements range from minimal requirements to a level comparable to the fda 
for example  many countries in south america have minimal regulatory requirements  while many developed countries  such as japan  have requirements at least as stringent as those of the fda 
foreign governments do not always accept fda approval as a substitute for their own approval or clearance procedures 
as of june  the member countries of the european union the union require that all medical products sold within their borders carry a conformite europeene mark ce mark 
the ce mark denotes that the applicable medical device has been found to be in compliance with guidelines concerning manufacturing and quality control  technical specifications and biological or chemical and clinical safety 
the ce mark supersedes all current medical device regulatory requirements for union countries 
we have obtained the ce mark for all of our principal products including our icl and ticl  iols including the toric iol and collamer iol  sonicwave phacoemulsification system and our aquaflow device 
we are also subject to various federal  state and local laws applicable to our operations including  among other things  working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
research and development we are focused on furthering technological advancements in the ophthalmic products industry through continuous innovative development of ophthalmic products and materials and related surgical techniques 
we 
table of contents maintain an active internal research and development program which activities includes research and development  clinical  and regulatory affairs and is comprised of employees 
in order to achieve its business objectives  we will continue to increase the investment in research and development 
in line with this goal  we recently announced the appointment of a new vice president of research and development 
further reorganization is underway to ensure that our goal of effective and timely delivery becomes a reality within the timeframe 
over the past year  we have principally focused our research and development efforts on bringing the visian icl to fda panel for approval  improving insertion and delivery systems for our foldable products  improving manufacturing systems and procedures for all products to reduce manufacturing costs resulting in yield increases for collamer products  us clinical evaluation of the visian toric icl  and developing products and extending foreign registrations for the refractive market 
research and development expenses were approximately   and  for our  and fiscal years  respectively 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations in each country where we have a business presence 
we do not anticipate that compliance with these laws will have any material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
we currently have no plans to invest in material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for the remainder of our current fiscal year or for the next fiscal year 
we are not aware of any pending litigation or significant financial obligations arising from current or past environmental practices that are likely to have a material adverse impact on our financial position 
however  environmental problems relating to our properties could develop in the future  and such problems could require significant expenditures 
additionally  we are unable to predict changes in legislation or regulations that may be adopted or enacted in the future and that may adversely affect us 
significant subsidiaries the company s only significant subsidiary is staar surgical ag  a wholly owned entity incorporated in switzerland 
this subsidiary develops  manufactures and distributes products worldwide including collamer iols  icls and the aquaflow device 
staar surgical ag also controls of domilens gmbh  a european sales subsidiary that distributes both staar products and products from various competitors 
employees as of february   we employed approximately persons

item properties our operations are conducted in leased facilities throughout the world 
our executive offices  manufacturing  warehouse and distribution  and primary research facilities are located in monrovia  california 
staar surgical ag maintains office  manufacturing  and warehouse and distribution facilities in nidau  switzerland 
the company has one additional facility in aliso viejo  california for raw material production and research and development activities 
the company leases additional sales and distribution facilities in germany and australia 
we believe our manufacturing facilities in the us and switzerland are suitable and adequate for our current and future planned requirements because manufacturing currently runs only one shift and the company could increase capacity by adding additional shifts at our existing facilities 
however  the company is at capacity in the us and switzerland in the areas of distribution and administration 
the company would require additional space to support growth in those areas  although this is not anticipated for item legal proceedings we are currently party to various claims and legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of our business 
these claims and legal proceedings relate to contractual rights and obligations  employment matters  and claims of product liability 
we do not believe that any of the claims known to us is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

overview staar surgical company develops  manufactures and distributes worldwide products used by ophthalmologists and other eye care professionals to improve or correct vision in patients with refractive conditions  cataracts and glaucoma 
we have manufacturing and distribution facilities in the us and switzerland and sell our products in countries 
during  the cataract segment continued to account for the majority of the company s revenues and  thus  the company operates as one business segment

total revenues cost of sales gross profit costs and expenses general and administrative marketing and selling research and development other charges total costs and expenses operating loss other expense  net loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit minority interest net loss fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues for the year ended january  increased over the year ended january  by or  due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange on sales of other ophthalmic products distributed in international markets 
excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange  sales decreased 
the decrease in sales is due primarily to a decrease in unit volume of the company s single and three piece silicone iol  primarily in the us market  due to a decline in competitiveness of the company s lens delivery systems and believed contraction of this market segment 
the decrease in sales of silicone iols was partially offset by increased sales in the us of collamer iols increase in volume partially offset by a decrease in average selling price asp 
as a result of the decreased silicone iol sales in the us  overall sales in that market declined 
sales of the aquaflow device decreased decrease in volume and a decrease in asp over this sales decrease was also realized in the us and was the result of sales and marketing 
table of contents resources which have been diverted from aquaflow proctoring and training to surgical evaluations of silicone lens injection systems and preparation for possible fda approval of the icl 
the decreases in single and three piece silicone iol and aquaflow sales were further offset by increased sales of icls  toric iols  staarvisc  and cruise control 
sales of icls in international markets increased due to a increase in units and a increase in asp 
sales of staarvisc increased on a increase in volume partially offset by a decrease in asp 
sales of toric iols increased due to a increase in volume partially offset by a decline in asp 
sales in international markets decreased excluding the impact of exchange due to a decrease in equipment sales in australia 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended january  was of revenues compared to the year ended january  when it was of revenues 
the improvement in gross profit margin is the result of successfully increasing standard margins across all of our primary product lines through reduced cost structures resulting from better yields  efficiencies and volume  and reducing other costs of sales through better management of excess and obsolete inventories 
additionally  the company streamlined its phacoemulsification manufacturing and repair division  during the year  resulting in lower costs and improved gross profit for this product line 
marketing and selling expenses 
marketing and selling expenses for the year ended january  increased million or over marketing and selling expense in the us increased by million as a result of marketing and promotional costs which increased  as planned  in preparation for the launch of the icl and increased headcount and associated recruiting costs in preparation for launch of the icl in the us  the addition of direct sales representatives for a newly established pacific northwest region  increased travel expenses and increased salaries 
marketing and selling expense increased internationally by million primarily due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates partially offset by reduced expenses of subsidiaries which were closed in and other charges 
other charges for the year ended january  were  compared to the year ended january  when they were million 
the charges in related to the write down of million net book value in capitalized patent costs in connection with the company s routine evaluation of such costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
the write down related to patents acquired in in the purchase of the company s majority interest in circuit tree medical  a developer and manufacturer of phacoemulsification equipment  whose ongoing operations were moved to the company s monrovia  ca facility 
the million charge was partially offset by the reversal of million of reserves against former officer s notes which were paid during the year 
other expense  net 
other expense for the year ended january  decreased  over the year ended january  the decreased expense is due to decreased interest expense and foreign exchange losses partially offset by decreased interest income from officer s notes that were paid in full and a  reserve on a note receivable the company recorded during the year 
income taxes 
income taxes for the year ended january  decreased million over the year ended january  the high provision for income taxes in was the result of a valuation allowance of million recorded against the company s deferred tax assets  partially offset by an income tax benefit of approximately million related to a federal carryback claim filed in the tax refund from the carryback claim was received in in  a subsidiary of the company obtained retroactively to  a ten year tax holiday for the payment of federal  cantonal and municipal income taxes in switzerland 
as such  swiss income taxes were not due on the operations of this subsidiary for the ten year period that ended on december  for  as the tax holiday from swiss taxes has expired  the appropriate federal  cantonal and municipal income taxes have been included in the foreign tax provision 

table of contents negotiations to extend the swiss tax holiday are ongoing 
the swiss tax authorities are considering granting an extension of the tax holiday with respect to new products including the icls  the toric icls and the aquaflow product line 
if the tax holiday is granted  it could be applicable retrospectively to  although this is not certain 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues for the year ended january  decreased over the year ended december  by or  the decrease in revenues was due primarily to a decrease in iol sales primarily in the united states 
approximately of the decrease in iol sales was the result of a decline in unit volume and of the decrease was the result of a decline in asp 
the decrease in iol sales was partially offset by an increase in sales in international markets of distributed products and a increase in icl sales 
unit volume of icls increased  partially offset by a decline in asp 
sales of staarvisc increased on increased volume and aquaflow sales increased on increased volume and asp 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended january  was of revenues compared to the year ended december  when it was of revenues including other charges of million related to inventory write offs primarily as the result of voluntary product recalls 
excluding the other charges  gross profit for the year ended december  was 
the lower gross profit for the current year compared to the previous year excluding other charges is due to the high unit costs of iol inventory manufactured in during a period of low production volumes 
gross profit for was also impacted by a shift in product mix from iols with a higher gross profit margin to equipment and other distributed product with a lower gross profit margin 
gross profit margin has improved sequentially each quarter since the second quarter of marketing and selling expenses 
marketing and selling expenses for the year ended january  were of revenues compared to of revenues for the year ended december  in terms of dollars  marketing and selling expenses for decreased million or over due to cost containment measures which have reduced overall spending in the us and the approximate million in cost savings the company has realized as a result of subsidiary closures in other charges 
other charges for the year ended january  were approximately million compared to the year ended december  when other charges were million 
the million in charges taken during related to the recognition of deferred losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency statements into us dollars of subsidiaries that were closed and employee separation 
other expense  net 
other expense  net for the year ended january  increased  over the year ended december  this increase was due to increased interest income due to prior year notes receivable reserves and write off of previous interest  offset by decreased income from the company s joint venture with canon staar company  inc  and increased foreign exchange losses 
income taxes 
during the year ended january   the company recorded a valuation allowance of million against its deferred tax assets 
this non cash charge reduced the deferred tax assets on the balance sheet to zero 
the assets were created as a result of income tax benefits that were recorded on us operating losses incurred during the restructuring and reorganization accomplished in and no deferred tax benefits were recorded on operating losses in current accounting standards place significant weight on a history of recent cumulative losses in determining whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary 
forecasts of future taxable income are not considered sufficient positive evidence to outweigh a history of losses 
accordingly  the assets were reserved in full 
the company s federal net operating loss carryforwards are not impacted and can continue to be utilized for up to years 
legislation enacted on march  hr enabled the company to carryback a portion of the federal net operating loss to  and since this legislation was not enacted as of the end of fiscal year  the benefit of  from this carryback was recorded in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its activities over the past several years principally from cash flow generated from operations  credit facilities provided by institutional domestic and foreign lenders  the private placement of common stock  the repayment of former officer s notes  and the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
for fiscal  cash used in operations was the result of net loss  adjusted for depreciation  amortization  the write off of patents  and other non cash charges 
for fiscal  cash provided by operations was the result of net loss  adjusted for depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes  and other non cash charges  and decreases in working capital primarily accounts receivable  inventory  and accounts payable 
for fiscal  cash used in operations was net loss  adjusted for depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes  and non cash restructuring and inventory write downs 
accounts receivable was million in  million in  and million in the decrease in accounts receivable is due to lower sales and increased collection efforts 
day s sales outstanding dso improved from days in to days in and days in the company does not believe that the trend of lower dso will continue in below the days realized in inventory at year end   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
day s inventory on hand decreased from days in to days in  and increased to days in decreased inventory in totaling million  was primarily the result of write offs of excess and obsolete inventory and inventory related to voluntary product recalls 
the decrease in inventory in was partially offset by higher cost inventory that was produced during the year as a result of decreased production volume 
this high cost inventory was sold during and replaced with lower cost inventory resulting in an overall decrease in inventory at the end of of million over inventory at the end of increased million over levels due to the build up of icl inventory in preparation of the launch of the product in the us and increased collamer iol inventory based on increased demand for the product 
the company expects that for  the value of its inventory will increase to approximately million 
accounts payable at year end   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in was the result of increased marketing expenses related to the anticipated launch of the icl in the us the decrease in was the result of companywide cost savings measures implemented during that year 
the benefits of those cost savings measures continued into net cash provided by used in investing activities was approximately   and  for fiscal   and  respectively 
proceeds from the payment of notes of former officers were the primary source of cash provided by investing activities in the principal investments of the company are in property and equipment 
investments in property and equipment were million   and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the investments are generally made to upgrade and improve existing production equipment and processes 
the company expects to spend approximately million on property and equipment in net cash provided by used in financing activities were approximately   and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in of cash provided by financing activities is primarily the result of net proceeds of million from a private placement of the company s common stock and million received from the exercise of stock options 
the company used approximately million of the proceeds to pay off the note to its domestic lender and  to pay down other notes payable 
in  the company used  in cash to pay down notes payable and in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of million in cash which was restricted pursuant to the renegotiated terms of the company s domestic line of credit 
the company has two foreign credit facilities with different banks to support operations in switzerland and germany 
the swiss credit agreement  which provides for borrowings of up to million swiss francs chf 
table of contents approximately million based on the rate of exchange on january   permits either fixed term or current advances 
the interest rate on current advances is and per annum at january  and january   respectively  plus a commission rate of 
payable quarterly 
the base interest rate for fixed term advances follows euromarket conditions for loans of a corresponding term and currency plus an individual margin and at january  and january  
borrowings outstanding under the note were chf million approximately million based on the rate of exchange at january  and chf million approximately million based on the rate of exchange on january  
the credit facility is secured by a general assignment of claims and includes positive and negative covenants which require the maintenance of a minimum level of equity of at least chf million approximately million based on the exchange rate on january   prevents the subsidiary from entering into other secured obligations or guaranteeing the obligations of others 
the agreement also prohibits repayment of loans made by the company to the subsidiary without the prior consent of the lender 
this financial covenant was not met as of january  and the bank has waived such non compliance 
the swiss credit facility is divided into two parts part a provides for borrowings of up to chf million million based on the exchange rate on january  and does not have a termination date  part b provides for borrowings of up to chf million million based on the exchange rate on january  
the loan amount under part b of the agreement reduces by chf   based on the exchange rate on january  semi annually beginning june  the german credit agreement  entered into during fiscal year  provides for borrowings of up to  eur  at the rate of exchange on january   at a rate of per annum is scheduled to mature in november the agreement prohibits the subsidiary from paying dividends and is personally guaranteed by the president of the company s german subsidiary 
this agreement replaced a previous credit agreement with another german bank that provided for borrowings during fiscal year of up to  eur  at the exchange rate on january   and carried interest at a rate of 
there were no borrowings outstanding under either agreement at january  or january  the following table represents the company s known contractual obligations included in the company s balance sheet as of january  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands notes payable capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total the company s liquidity requirements arise from the funding of its working capital needs  primarily inventory  work in process and accounts receivable 
the company s primary sources for working capital and capital expenditures are cash flow from operations  proceeds from the private placement of common stock  proceeds from option exercises  debt repayments by former officers  and borrowings under the company s foreign bank credit facilities 
any withdrawal of support from its banks could have serious consequences on the company s liquidity 
the company s liquidity is dependent  in part  on customers paying within credit terms  and any extended delays in payments or changes in credit terms given to major customers may have an impact on the company s cash flow 
in addition  any abnormal product returns or pricing adjustments may also affect the company s short term funding 
the company believes it has sufficient cash to fund existing operations and that it could obtain additional financing  if necessary  although this is not certain 

table of contents on december   the company received a warning letter issued by the us food and drug administration fda which outlined certain deficiencies related to the company s manufacturing and quality assurance systems which were identified during inspection audits of the company s monrovia  ca facility 
the company is aggressively pursuing corrective actions to remedy the issues and does not expect the direct costs of these corrections to be significant 
however  until the fda is satisfied with the company s response  the company cannot be granted approval on new products and could face restrictions on established domestic lines of business 
while there can be no assurance that an adverse determination of any of the items identified by the fda could not have a material adverse impact in any future period  management does not believe  based upon information known to it  that the final resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the company s consolidated financial position and annual results of operations and cash flows 
see factors that may affect future results of operations we are subject to extensive government regulation  which increases our costs and could prevent us from selling our products 
critical accounting policies the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
in general  the company supplies foldable iols on a consignment basis to customers  primarily ophthalmologists  surgical centers  hospitals and other eye care providers and recognizes sales when the iols are implanted 
sales of all other products  including sales to foreign distributors  are generally recognized upon shipment 
revenue from license and technology agreements is recorded as income  when earned  according to the terms of the respective agreements 
impairment of long lived assets 
intangible and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in reviewing for impairment  the company compares the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than their carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the assets fair value and their carrying value 
goodwill  which has an indefinite life and was previously amortized on a straight line basis over the periods benefited  is no longer amortized to earnings  but instead is subject to periodic testing for impairment 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives 
goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
as provided under sfas  the initial testing of goodwill for possible impairment was completed within the first six months of and an annual assessment was completed during  and no impairment has been identified 
as of january   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
the company also has other intangible assets consisting of patents and licenses  with a gross book value of million and accumulated amortization of million as of january  amortization is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are based on legal and contractual provisions  and range from to years 
the company capitalizes the costs of acquiring patents and licenses 
deferred taxes 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities along with net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset may not be realized 
the impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws  if any  are applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled and reflected in the financial statements in the period of enactment 
in  due to the company s recent history of losses  an increase to the valuation allowance was recorded as a non cash charge to tax expense in the amount of million 
as a result  the valuation 
table of contents allowance fully offsets the value of deferred tax assets on the company s balance sheet as of january  if in the future  the company determines it will be able to utilize all or part of the deferred tax assets which have a valuation allowance of million at january   we would reverse the valuation allowance  which would result in an income tax benefit 
factors that may affect future results of operations our short and long term success is subject to many factors that are beyond our control 
stockholders and prospective stockholders in the company should consider carefully the following risk factors  in addition to other information contained in this report 
this annual report on form l k contains forward looking statements  which are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth below 
we have a history of losses 
we have reported losses in each of the last three fiscal years and have an accumulated deficit of million as of january  if losses from operations continue  they could adversely affect the market price for our common stock and our ability to obtain new financing 
in june  we began implementing a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and improving operating efficiency 
in connection with this plan  we recognized pre tax charges to earnings of million  million  and million in fiscal   and while the restructuring plan has generally improved our profit margins  we cannot be certain that we will succeed in restoring our profitability 
we have limited access to credit and have been in default of the terms of our loan agreements 
as of january   we failed to comply with a covenant under our principal foreign loan agreement which prohibits the repayment of loans made by the company to the subsidiary without the prior consent of the lender 
accordingly  we had to obtain a waiver from our lender 
as of january   we have outstanding balances on the loans of our european subsidiaries of approximately million  based on exchange rates on that date 
we believe that sufficient cash to fund operations and current growth plans will be provided by cash from operations and existing cash balances 
however  it is likely that we will also need access to credit to finance operations and fund future growth 
because of our history of losses we may not be able secure adequate financing for these purposes on terms that are favorable to us or on any terms 
we have received a warning letter from the fda which will delay approval of the icl and limit our existing business in the united states 
on december   we received a warning letter issued by the fda 
while we are acting to correct the deficiencies identified in the warning letter  until the fda is satisfied with our response  we will not be granted approval to market the icl in the united states and we may face fda restrictions on our established domestic lines of business 
even if the fda approves our corrective action  the publication of the warning letter or similar actions in the future could harm our reputation and reduce sales 
a copy of the warning letter is attached as exhibit to our current report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission on january  our success depends on the icl  which has not been approved for use in the united states 
we have devoted significant resources and management attention to the development and introduction of our icl and ticl 
our management believes that the future success of staar depends on the approval of the icl by the fda and a successful launch of the icl in north america 
the icl is already approved for use in the countries comprising the european union and canada and in parts of asia 
the ticl is approved for use in the countries comprising the european union 
in october  the fda ophthalmic devices panel recommended that the fda approve  with conditions  specified uses of the icl 
the fda has not yet acted on this 
table of contents recommendation  and it could decide to reject the ophthalmic devices panel recommendations 
until the fda is satisfied with our response to its warning letter dated december   we will not be granted approval to market the icl in the united states 
if the fda does not grant approval of the icl  or significantly delays its approval  whether because of the issues contained in the warning letter or otherwise  our prospects for success will be severely diminished 
our success depends on the successful marketing of the icl in the united states market 
even if it is approved by the fda  the icl will not reach its full sales potential unless we successfully plan and execute its launch and marketing in the united states 
this will present new challenges to our sales and marketing staff and to our independent manufacturers representatives 
in countries where the icl has been approved to date  our sales have grown steadily  but slowly 
in the united states in particular  patients who might benefit from the icl have already been exposed to a great deal of advertising and publicity about laser refractive surgery  but have little if any awareness of the icl 
as a result  we expect to make extensive use of advertising and promotion targeted to potential patients through providers  and to carefully manage the introduction of the icl 
we do not have unlimited resources and we cannot predict whether the particular marketing  advertising and promotion strategies we pursue will be as successful as we intend 
if we do not successfully market the icl in the united states  we will not achieve our planned profitability and growth 
our core domestic business has suffered declining sales  which sales of new products have only partially offset 
staar pioneered the foldable iol for use in cataract surgery  and the foldable silicone iol remains our largest source of revenue 
since we introduced the product  however  competitors have introduced iols employing a variety of designs and materials 
over the years these products have gradually taken a larger share of the iol market  while the market share for staar iols has decreased 
in particular  many surgeons now choose lenses made of acrylic material rather than silicone for their typical patients 
in an effort to maintain our competitive position we have introduced a new biocompatible lens material  collamer  to our line of iols 
we have also introduced new iol designs  such as the toric iol  pioneered cartridge injector systems for lens insertion  and have continued to improve and refine the silicone iol 
sales of these new products  however  have only partially offset declining sales of our silicone iols 
we depend on independent manufacturers representatives 
in an effort to manage costs and bring our products to a wider market  we have entered into long term agreements with several independent regional manufacturers representatives  who introduce our products to eye surgeons and provide the training needed to begin using some of our products 
under our agreements with these representatives  each receives a commission on all of our sales within a specified region  including sales on products we sell into their territories without their assistance 
because they are independent contractors  we have a limited ability to manage these representatives or their employees 
in addition  a representative may represent manufacturers other than staar  although not in competing products 
we have been relying on the independent representatives to introduce our new products like collamer iols  toric iols and the aquaflow device  and we will rely on them  in part  to help introduce the icl if it is approved 
however  we are also introducing direct application specialists to assist in proctoring and surgeon training to ensure physician compliance and enhance patient outcomes as a means of growing this segment of the market 
if the introduction of direct application specialists is not successful  or our independent manufacturers representatives do not devote sufficient resources to marketing our products  or if they lack the skills or resources to market our new products  our new products will fail to reach their full sales potential and sales of our established products could decline 
product recalls have been costly and may be so in the future 
medical devices must be manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances  and often incorporate newly developed technology 
despite all efforts to achieve the highest level of quality control and advance testing  from 
table of contents time to time defects or technical flaws in our products may not come to light until after the products are sold or consigned 
in those circumstances  we have previously made voluntary recalls of our products 
recalls significantly impacted our revenue in when  in separate instances  we voluntarily recalled our three piece collamer lens and certain silicone lenses  and as a result wrote down approximately million in inventory in that year 
in january we voluntarily recalled selected lots of iol cartridges and in february  in an action the fda considers a recall but where there is no requirement for product to be returned to us  we issued a letter to healthcare professionals advising them of the potential for a change in manifest refraction over time in rare cases involving the single piece collamer iol 
similar recalls could take place again 
courts or regulators can also impose mandatory recalls on us  even if we believe our products are safe and effective 
recalls can result in lost sales of the recalled products themselves  and can result in further lost sales while replacement products are manufactured  especially if the replacements must be redesigned 
if recalled products have already been implanted  we may bear some or all of the cost of corrective surgery 
recalls may also damage our professional reputation and the reputation of our products 
the inconvenience caused by recalls and related interruptions in supply  and the damage to our reputation  could cause some professionals to discontinue using our products 
we compete with much larger companies 
our competitors  including alcon  inc  amo  bausch lomb  inc  and pfizer  inc  have much greater financial resources than we do and some of them have large international markets for a full suite of ophthalmic products 
their greater resources for research  development and marketing  and their greater capacity to offer comprehensive products and equipment to providers  make it difficult for us to compete 
we have lost significant market share to some of our competitors 
most of our products have single site manufacturing approvals  exposing us to risks of business interruption 
we manufacture all of our products either at our facility in monrovia  california or our facility in nidau  switzerland 
most of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one of these sites 
before we can use a second manufacturing site for an implantable device we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities 
because this process is expensive we have generally not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site 
if a natural disaster  fire  or other serious business interruption struck one of our manufacturing facilities  it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product 
we could lose customers to competitors  thereby reducing sales  profitability and market share 
risks related to the ophthalmic products industry if we fail to keep pace with advances in our industry or fail to persuade physicians to adopt the new products we introduce  customers may not buy our products and our revenue may decline 
constant development of new technologies and techniques  frequent new product introductions and strong price competition characterize the ophthalmic industry 
the first company to introduce a new product or technique to market usually gains a significant competitive advantage 
our future growth depends  in part  on our ability to develop products to treat diseases and disorders of the eye that are more effective  safer  or incorporate emerging technologies better than our competitors products 
sales of our existing products may decline rapidly if one of our competitors introduces a substantially superior product  or if we announce a new product of our own 
similarly  if we fail to make sufficient investments in research and development or if we focus on technologies that do not lead to better products  our current and planned products could be surpassed by more effective or advanced products 
in addition  we must manufacture these products economically and market them successfully by persuading a sufficient number of eye care professionals to use them 
for example  glaucoma requires ongoing treatment over a long period of time  thus  many doctors are reluctant to switch a patient to a new treatment if the patient s current treatment for glaucoma remains effective 
this has been a challenge in selling our aquaflow device 

table of contents resources devoted to research and development may not yield new products that achieve commercial success 
we spent of our revenue on research and development during the year ended january   and we expect to spend comparable amounts annually in the future 
development of new implantable technology  from discovery through testing and registration to initial product launch  is expensive and typically takes from three to seven years 
because of the complexities and uncertainties of ophthalmic research and development  products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required for us to market the products successfully 
it is possible that few or none of the products currently under development will become commercially successful 
failure of users of our products to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors could limit market acceptance of our products  which could affect our sales and profits 
many of our products  in particular iols and products related to the treatment of glaucoma  are used in procedures that are typically covered by health insurance  hmo plans  medicare or medicaid 
these third party payors have recently been trying to contain costs by restricting the types of procedures they reimburse to those viewed as most cost effective and capping or reducing reimbursement rates 
these polices could adversely affect sales and prices of our products 
physicians  hospitals and other health care providers may be reluctant to purchase our products if third party payors do not adequately reimburse them for the cost of our products and the use of our surgical equipment 
for example major third party payors for hospital services  including government insurance plans  medicare  medicaid and private health care insurers  have substantially revised their payment methodologies during the last few years  resulting in stricter standards for reimbursement of hospital and outpatient charges for some medical procedures  including cataract procedures and iols  numerous legislative proposals have been considered that  if enacted  would result in major reforms in the united states health care system  which could have an adverse effect on our business  our competitors may reduce the prices of their products  which could result in third party payors favoring our competitors  there are proposed and existing laws and regulations governing maximum product prices and the profitability of companies in the health care industry  and there have been recent initiatives by third party payors to challenge the prices charged for medical products 
reductions in the prices for our products in response to these trends could reduce our profits 
moreover  our products may not be covered in the future by third party payors  which would also reduce our sales 
we are subject to extensive government regulation  which increases our costs and could prevent us from selling our products 
government regulations and agency oversight apply to every aspect of our business  including testing  manufacturing  safety and environmental controls  efficacy  labeling  advertising  promotion  record keeping  the sale and distribution of products and samples 
we are also subject to government regulation over the prices we charge and the rebates we offer to customers 
complying with government regulation substantially increases the cost of developing  manufacturing and selling our products 
in the united states  we must obtain approval from the fda for each product that we market 
competing in the ophthalmic products industry requires us to continuously introduce new or improved products and processes  and to submit these to the fda for approval 
obtaining fda approval is a long and expensive process  and approval is never certain 
in addition  our operations in the united states are subject to periodic inspection by the fda 
such inspection may result in the fda ordering changes in our business practices  which changes could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents products distributed outside of the united states are also subject to government regulation  which may be equally or more demanding 
our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval 
if a regulatory authority delays approval of a potentially significant product  the potential sales of the product and its value to us can be substantially reduced 
even if the fda or another regulatory agency approves a product  the approval may limit the indicated uses of the product  or may otherwise limit our ability to promote  sell and distribute the product  or may require post marketing studies 
if we cannot obtain regulatory approval of our new products  or if the approval is too narrow  we will not be able to market these products  which would eliminate or reduce our potential sales and earnings 
the global nature of our business may result in fluctuations and declines in our sales and profits 
our products are sold in more than countries 
revenues from international operations make up a significant portion of our total revenue 
for the year ended january  revenues from international operations was 
the results of operations and the financial position of certain of our offshore operations are reported in the relevant local currencies and then translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements  exposing us to translation risk 
in addition  we are exposed to transaction risk because some of our expenses are incurred in a different currency from the currency in which our revenues are received 
in  our most significant currency exposures were to the euro  the swiss franc  and the australian dollar 
the exchange rates between these and other local currencies and the united states dollar may fluctuate substantially 
we have not attempted to offset our exposure to these risks by investing in derivatives or engaging in other hedging transactions 
fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar against other currencies have not had a material adverse effect on our operating margins and profitability in the past 
economic  social and political conditions  laws  practices and local customs vary widely among the countries in which we sell our products 
our operations outside of the united states are subject to a number of risks and potential costs  including lower profit margins  less stringent protection of intellectual property and economic  political and social uncertainty in some countries  especially in emerging markets 
our continued success as a global company depends  in part  on our ability to develop and implement policies and strategies that are effective in anticipating and managing these and other risks in the countries where we do business 
these and other risks may have a material adverse effect on our operations in any particular country and on our business as a whole 
we price some of our products in us dollars  and as a result changes in exchange rates can make our products more expensive in some offshore markets and reduce our revenues 
inflation in emerging markets also makes our products more expensive there and increases the credit risks to which we are exposed 
we depend on proprietary technologies  but may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately 
we have numerous patents and pending patent applications 
we rely on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures and patent  trademark  copyright and trade secrecy laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
these legal measures afford limited protection and may not prevent our competitors from gaining access to our intellectual property and proprietary information 
any of our patents may be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that any pending patent application held by us will result in an issued patent or that if patents are issued to us  the patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or competitive technologies 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
any litigation could result in substantial expense  may reduce our profits and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered by patents in our industry may involve complex legal issues that are not fully resolved 

table of contents any litigation or claims against us  whether or not successful  could result in substantial costs and harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following to cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which would adversely affect our revenue  to negotiate a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  or to redesign our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of a third party  which may be costly and time consuming or impossible to accomplish 
we obtain some of the components of our products from a single source  and an interruption in the supply of those components could reduce our revenue 
we obtain some of the components for our products from a single source 
for example  only one supplier produces our viscoelastic product 
although we believe we could find alternate supplies for any of these components  the loss or interruption of any of these suppliers could increase costs  reducing our revenue and profitability  or harm our customer relations by delaying product deliveries 
we may not successfully develop and launch replacements for our products that lose patent protection 
most of our products are covered by patents that give us a degree of market exclusivity during the term of the patent 
we have also earned revenue in the past by licensing some of our patented technology to other ophthalmic companies 
the legal life of a patent is years from application 
patents covering our products will expire from this year through the next years 
upon patent expiration  our competitors may introduce products using the same technology 
as a result of this possible increase in competition  we may need to charge a lower price in order to maintain sales of our products  which could make these products less profitable 
if we fail to develop and successfully launch new products prior to the expiration of patents for our existing products  our sales and profits with respect to those products could decline significantly 
we may not be able to develop and successfully launch more advanced replacement products before these and other patents expire 
our activities involve hazardous materials and emissions and may subject us to environmental liability 
our manufacturing  research and development practices involve the controlled use of hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we have operations governing the use  manufacturing  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products 
although we believe that our safety and environmental procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
remedial environmental actions could require us to incur substantial unexpected costs  which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
if we were involved in a major environmental accident or found to be in substantial non compliance with applicable environmental laws  we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines 
we risk losses through litigation 
we are currently party to various claims and legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of our business 
these claims and legal proceedings relate to contractual rights and obligations  employment matters  and claims of product liability 
while we do not believe that any of the claims known to us is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  new claims or unexpected results of existing claims could lead to significant financial harm 
we depend on key employees 
we depend on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees 
the loss of a key employee could hurt our business 
we could be particularly hurt if any key employee or employees went to work 
table of contents for competitors 
our future success depends on our ability to identify  attract  train and motivate other highly skilled personnel 
failure to do so may adversely affect future results 
risks related to ownership of our common stock our certificate of incorporation could delay or prevent an acquisition or sale of our company 
our certificate of incorporation empowers the board of directors to establish and issue a class of preferred stock  and to determine the rights  preferences and privileges of the preferred stock 
we also have a stockholders rights plan  which could discourage a third party from making an offer to acquire us 
these provisions give the board of directors the ability to deter  discourage or make more difficult a change in control of our company  even if such a change in control would be in the interest of a significant number of our stockholders or if such a change in control would provide our stockholders with a substantial premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price for the common stock 
our bylaws contain other provisions that could have an anti takeover effect  including the following only one of the three classes of directors is elected each year  stockholders have limited ability to remove directors  stockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders  and stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors 
anti takeover provisions of delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 
we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
they could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock or preventing changes in our management 
future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to downward price pressure as a result of sales of our recent private placement of  shares of common stock  which have been registered for resale  or the perception that these sales could occur 
in addition  the perception that we might conduct similar private placements followed by public offering of the privately placed shares could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock 
as of january   there were  shares of our common stock outstanding  with another  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of options granted under our stock option plans or under certain agreements with our senior officers 
the stock underlying these options has been registered for resale with the sec 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated widely  ranging from to during the year ended january  our stock price could continue to experience significant fluctuations in response to factors such as quarterly variations in operating results  operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  changes in financial estimates  changes in market valuations of competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of a material nature  additions or departures of key personnel  future sales of common stock and stock volume fluctuations 
also  general political and economic conditions such as recession or interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our stock 

table of contents foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its suppliers or customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected the company s ability to purchase or sell products at agreed upon prices 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future  which would affect the company s operating results 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations during the past three years

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manages its risks based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
management does not believe that these market risks are material to the results of operations or cash flows of the company  and  accordingly  does not generally enter into interest rate or foreign exchange rate hedge instruments 
interest rate risk 
our million of debt is based on the borrowings of our international subsidiaries 
the majority of our international borrowings bear an interest rate that is linked to euro market conditions and  thus  our interest rate expense will fluctuate with changes in those conditions 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by for the year  our annual interest rate expense would increase or decrease by approximately  foreign currency risk 
our international subsidiaries operate in and are net recipients of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  we benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide primarily  the euro and australian dollar 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and particularly the strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated sales and gross profit as expressed in us dollars 
additionally  as of january   all of our debt is denominated in swiss francs and as such  we are subject to fluctuations of the swiss franc as compared to the us dollar in converting the value of the debt in us dollars 
the us dollar value of the debt is increased by a weaker dollar and decreased by a stronger dollar relative to the swiss franc
