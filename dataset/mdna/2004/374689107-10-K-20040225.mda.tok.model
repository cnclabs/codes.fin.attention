such decisions include the selection of applicable principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company s most critical accounting policies include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts general and administrative expense  valuation of inventory  which impacts cost of sales and gross margin  and the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible and long lived assets  which impacts write offs of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets 
management reviews the estimates  including  but not limited to  the allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experiences  current conditions and future expectations 
the reviews are performed regularly and adjustments are made as required by current available information 
management believes these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company s accounts receivable represent those amounts which have been billed to the company s customers but not yet collected 
management analyzes various factors including historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts balance is established based on the portion of those accounts receivable which are deemed to be potentially uncollectible 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized 
the company states its inventories at lower of cost or market 
the cost basis of the company s inventory is determined on a first in first out basis using either actual costs or a standard cost methodology which approximates actual cost 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives which consist primarily of non competition agreements are amortized to their residual values over those estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefit consumed 
long lived assets with estimated useful lives are depreciated to their residual values over those useful lives in proportion to the economic value consumed 
long lived assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable and exceeds its fair market value 
this circumstance exists if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value as determined by discounted cash flow method or in the case of negative cash flow  an independent market appraisal of the asset 
goodwill is tested annually  or sooner if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
a reporting unit is either the same as  or one level below  an operating segment 
the primary valuation method for determining the fair value of the reporting unit is a discounted cash flows analysis 
if the goodwill is indicated as being impaired the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  the fair value of the reporting unit would then be allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill would then be compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill and  if it is less  the company would then recognize an impairment loss 
the projection of future cash flows for the goodwill impairment analysis requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the assets and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows  changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows or use of different assumptions could result in changes in this assessment 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal capital requirements are to fund its operations  including working capital  the purchase and funding of improvements to its facilities  machinery and equipment and to fund acquisitions 
the company s shareholders equity increased by approximately million or  to million  at december  this increase was primarily due to the receipt of million in net proceeds from the company s common stock offering in december  proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options  as well as net income of million  including earnings from the company s acquisitions

net cash provided by operating activities in was due primarily to net income of million combined with depreciation and amortization of million  the provision for deferred income taxes of million  reductions in inventories of million and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million offset by increases in accounts receivable and other current assets which aggregated million 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities and the net proceeds of million from the company s stock offering plus cash on hand at the beginning of the period and cash generated by the exercise of stock options of million  were used to pay down million of the company s long term debt  to fund current operations  the acquisitions of constructions metals and air vent of million net of cash acquired  capital expenditures of million and pay cash dividends of million
