item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this annual report on form k contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance 
words such as expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  seek  estimate and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in these forward looking statements 
in addition  subsequent events and developments may cause our expectations to change 
while we may elect to update these forward looking statements we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so  even if our expectations change 
see the important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading factors affecting future operating results that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make 
overview we derive our revenue primarily from sales of bis monitors  bis module kits and related accessories  which we collectively refer to as equipment  and sales of bis sensors 
for management purposes  we segregate our revenue by export sales by region and sales by products as shown in the following table in thousands domestic revenue percent of total revenue international revenue percent of total revenue bis sensor revenue percent of total revenue equipment revenue percent of total revenue at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
we follow a system of fiscal quarters as opposed to calendar quarters 
under this system  the first three quarters of each fiscal year end on the saturday closest to the end of the calendar quarter and the last quarter of the fiscal year always ends on december we believe our ability to grow our revenue is directly related to our ability to sell our equipment to healthcare organizations and influence our customers to purchase and use our bis sensors 
we believe the increase in our installed base of equipment resulting from the sale of bis monitors and the sale of original equipment manufacturers equipment incorporating our bis module kit have been the primary reasons for the growth in revenue from the sale of bis sensors 
in order to successfully grow our business  we need to continue to focus on both selling our equipment and improving our per monitor and per module sensor utilization rate 
to achieve this growth  we continue to implement new sales and marketing programs 
we expect that as we grow our business  revenue from the sale of bis sensors should contribute an increasing percentage of total revenue 
additionally  we believe that over time  revenue from the sale of bis module kits will increase as a percentage of total equipment revenue as healthcare organizations purchase our technology as part of an integrated solution offered by our original equipment manufacturers 
in  approximately of our growth in our installed base was attributable to placements by our original equipment manufacturers 
we believe that maintaining our gross profit margin and controlling the growth of our operating expenses are important factors to achieving profitability 
to maintain our gross profit margin we believe we must continue to focus on maintaining our average unit prices for both bis monitors and bis sensors  increase revenue from the sale of bis sensors as a percentage of total revenue  as bis sensors have a higher gross profit margin than equipment  and continue to reduce the costs of manufacturing our products 

table of contents in addition  the transition from bis monitor placements to bis module placements has adversely impacted our gross profit margin on equipment as bis module kits have a lower gross margin than the bis monitors 
however  we believe that this transition should  over time  improve our total gross profit margin as we expect bis module placements to be a contributing factor to increasing revenue from the sale of our bis sensors 
for those healthcare organizations desiring to purchase our bis monitors  we offer two options 
our customers have the option either to purchase bis monitors outright or to acquire bis monitors pursuant to a sales type lease agreement whereby the customer contractually commits to purchase a minimum number of bis sensors per bis monitor per year 
under our sales type leases  customers purchase bis sensors and the bis monitor for the purchase price of the bis sensors plus an additional charge per bis sensor to pay for the purchase price of the bis monitor and related financing costs over the term of the agreement 
we also grant these customers an option to purchase the bis monitors at the end of the term of the agreement  which is typically three to five years 
we recognize equipment revenue under sales type lease agreements either at shipment or delivery in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with interest income recognized over the life of the sales type lease 
the cost of the bis monitor acquired by the customer is recorded as costs of revenue in the same period 
sales type leases accounted for approximately  and of total revenue in  and  respectively 
under certain limited circumstances  we also offer customers the opportunity to use the bis monitors under our equipment placement program  which we refer to as the ep program 
under the ep program  the customer is granted the right to use the bis monitors for a mutually agreed upon period of time 
during this period  the customer purchases bis sensors at a price that includes a premium above the list price of the bis sensors to cover the rental of the equipment  but without any minimum purchase commitments 
at the end of the agreed upon period  the customer has the option of purchasing the bis monitors  continuing to use them under the ep program or returning them to us 
beginning in  we substantially reduced our focus and reliance on the ep program 
sensor revenue related to the ep program was approximately million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
at december  and the number of bis monitors used in the ep program had decreased by and  respectively 
we have subsidiaries in the netherlands and the united kingdom to facilitate the sale of our products into the international market 
we are continuing to develop our international sales and distribution program through a combination of distributors and marketing partners  including companies with which we have entered into original equipment manufacturer relationships 
in january  we entered into a distribution agreement with nihon kohden corporation to distribute bis monitors in japan 
in march  nihon kohden received approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare for marketing in japan our a eeg monitor with bis and in may  received approval for marketing in japan our a bis monitor 
nihon kohden has requested but has not yet received approval to market the bis xp system in japan 
in january  the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare granted reimbursement approval for use of our bis monitors 
with this approval  healthcare providers in japan are eligible to receive partial reimbursement of  yen each time bis monitoring is used 
in july  the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare approved our bis module for marketing in japan 
sales to nihon kohden represented approximately  and  respectively  of international revenue in  and  respectively 
various factors may adversely affect our quarterly operating results through the first fiscal quarter of and the year ending december  these factors include a potentially adverse effect on equipment revenue and gross profit margin on equipment as we continue to shift the focus of our placements from bis monitors to bis modules 
in addition  in japan  nihon kohden is awaiting approval of the bis xp system  and we believe customers may continue to delay purchases of our products or may choose not to purchase our products pending this approval 
finally  on november   our international master distribution agreement with datex ohmeda expired 
we are currently replacing this agreement with country specific distribution agreements with datex ohmeda sales subsidiaries and other distributors in various countries 
a delay in signing these country specific distribution agreements may adversely affect equipment revenue in the 
table of contents international market 
to date  we have entered into several new country specific distribution agreements  and we continue to negotiate others 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k includes a summary of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made estimates and judgments in determining certain amounts included in the financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we do not believe there is a significant likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we sell our bis monitors primarily through a combination of a direct sales force and through distributors 
our bis module kits are sold through original equipment manufacturers 
bis sensors are sold through a combination of a direct sales force  distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
direct product sales are structured as sales  sales type lease arrangements or sales under our ep program 
we recognize revenue from product sales when earned as required by generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition and eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery  including customer acceptance  has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for product sales  revenue is not recognized until title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
we also recognize revenue from prepaid license and royalty fees 
this revenue is deferred until product shipment or delivery in accordance with the terms of the agreement and license and royalty fees are earned in accordance with the terms of the respective agreements 
in august  we recorded approximately  of deferred revenue related to an oem product development and distribution agreement with boston scientific corporation 
the deferred revenue is being recognized ratably over the term of the oem product development and distribution agreement  which represents our best estimate of our period of significant continuing obligation to provide boston scientific corporation exclusive distribution rights to newly developed technology 
if our estimate of the period of significant continuing obligation is revised  this may have an impact on our revenue recognition of the deferred revenue related to the boston scientific corporation agreement 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for leases  for our sales type lease agreements 
under our sales type leases  customers purchase bis sensors and the bis monitor for the purchase price of the bis sensors plus an additional charge per bis sensor to pay for the purchase price of the bis monitor and related financing costs over the term of the agreement 
the minimum lease payment  consisting of the additional charge per bis sensor  less the unearned interest income  which is computed at the interest rate implicit in the lease  is recorded as the net investment in sales type leases 
we recognize equipment revenue under sales type lease agreements either at shipment or delivery in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with interest income recognized over the life of the sales type lease 
the cost of the bis monitor acquired by the customer is recorded as costs of revenue in the same period 
we review and assess the net realizability of our investment in sales type leases at each reporting period 
this review includes determining  on a customer specific basis  if a customer is significantly underperforming relative to the customer s cumulative level of committed bis sensor purchases as required by the sales type lease agreement 
if a customer is underperforming  we record an allowance for lease payments as a charge to revenue to reflect the lower estimate of the net realizable investment in sales type lease balance 

table of contents under our ep program  the customer is granted the right to use the bis monitors for a mutually agreed upon period of time 
during this period  the customer purchases bis sensors at a price that includes a premium above the list price of the bis sensors to cover the rental of the equipment  but without any minimum purchase commitments 
at the end of the agreed upon period  the customer has the option of purchasing the bis monitors  continuing to use them under the ep program or returning them to us 
under the ep program  no equipment revenue is recognized as the equipment remains our property and title does not pass to the customer and the criteria for sales type leases under sfas no 
are not met 
the bis monitors under the ep program are depreciated over two years and the depreciation is charged to costs of revenue 
bis sensor revenue is recognized either at shipment or delivery of the bis sensors in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms 
we recognize revenue either at shipment or delivery in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with distributors and original equipment manufacturers in accordance with sab no 
sales to distributors and original equipment manufacturers include a clause in the contracts that indicates that customer acceptance is limited to confirmation that our products function in accordance with our applicable product specifications in effect at the time of delivery 
formal acceptance by the distributor or original equipment manufacturer is not necessary to recognize revenue provided that we objectively demonstrate that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions are satisfied 
each product is tested prior to shipment to ensure that it meets the applicable product specifications in effect at the time of delivery 
additionally  we have historically had a minimal number of defective products shipped to distributors and original equipment manufacturers and any defective products are subject to repair or replacement under warranty as distributors and original equipment manufacturers do not have a right of return 
our obligations under warranty are limited to repair or replacement of any product that we reasonably determine to be covered by the warranty 
we record an estimate for our total warranty obligation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
accounts receivable we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by using estimates based on our historical collections experience  current trends  historical write offs of our receivables  credit policy and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
we also review the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in our credit policies 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  our credit loss rates in the future may not be consistent with our historical experience 
to the extent we experience a deterioration in our historical collections experience or increased credit losses  bad debt expense would likely increase in future periods 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or estimated market  and determine cost on a first in  first out basis 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on production history and on our estimated forecast of product demand 
the medical industry in which we market our products is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances that could result in obsolescence of inventory 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we would need to change our estimate of the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
if revisions are deemed necessary  we would recognize the adjustments in the form of a charge to costs of revenue at the time of the determination 
therefore  although we continually update our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated declines in demand or technological developments  such as the introduction of new products by our competitors  could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 

table of contents warranty equipment that we sell generally is covered by a warranty period of one year 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on our historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty expenses will increase  and we would experience decreased gross profit margin and cash flow 
results of operations the following tables present  for the periods indicated  information expressed as a percentage of revenue and a summary of our total revenue 
this information has been derived from our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any period

table of contents revenue 
the increase in revenue from the sale of bis sensors from to was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately in the number of bis sensors sold as a result of growth in the installed base of bis monitors and bis modules 
the increase in the number of bis sensors sold was complemented by an increase in the average selling price of bis sensors of approximately 
our installed base of bis monitors and bis modules increased approximately to  units at december  compared to  units at december  the increase in revenue from the sale of equipment from to was primarily driven by an increase in bis module kit revenue of approximately 
the increase in module revenue for this period was due to an increase of approximately in the number of bis module kits shipped to our original equipment manufacturers  from  bis module kits in to  bis module kits in the increase in bis module kit revenue in this period was partially offset by a decrease in bis monitor revenue of approximately 
the decrease in bis monitor revenue resulted from a decrease of approximately in unit volume  as we shipped  bis monitors in compared to  bis monitors in the decrease in monitor unit volume was a result of a decrease of approximately in international bis monitors shipped  particularly relating to units shipped to japan 
sales of bis monitor units in japan decreased from units shipped in to none in as nihon kohden delayed additional bis monitor purchases pending the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare approval of the xp technology 
our gross profit margin was approximately of revenue in as compared to a gross profit margin of approximately of revenue in the increase in gross profit margin for the year ended december  was a result of four factors 
first  we experienced increased sales of our bis sensors as a percentage of total revenue during the year ended december  bis sensors accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  bis sensors have a higher gross profit margin than equipment 
second  we had an increase in the worldwide average unit price on bis monitors of approximately in compared to third  we have had a reduction in depreciation expense related to bis monitors used in the ep program as the existing pool of bis monitors becomes fully depreciated and we substantially reduce our focus and reliance on the ep program 
finally  we recognized approximately  of deferred revenue in the year ended december  related to the strategic alliance with boston scientific corporation without any corresponding costs of revenue  increasing the gross profit margin by approximately 
we expect our gross profit margin to increase slightly in compared with as we expect sales from bis sensors to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenue 
expense overview percentage increase decrease in thousands expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative research and development 
the decrease in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to a decrease in research and development personnel and related payroll and other expenses of approximately  this decrease was offset by an increase in consulting expenses of approximately  for various ongoing projects 
we expect research and development expenses in to increase moderately as compared with as we continue to invest in clinical studies and expand applications for our technology  including our initiatives into neuroscience 
sales and marketing 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in as compared to was attributable to decreases of approximately  in travel and entertainment expenses  approximately  in operating expenses associated with our international subsidiaries  approximately  in 
table of contents expenses related to advertising  public relations  tradeshows and the internet  approximately  in recruiting expenses and approximately  in payroll expense 
the  decrease in expenses associated with our international subsidiaries was driven by a decrease of approximately  in personnel and related payroll expenses 
the decreases in sales and marketing expenses were offset by an increase in commissions expense of approximately million 
we expect sales and marketing expenses in to decrease compared with as a result of cost reductions in various programs and improved control over discretionary spending 
general and administrative 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in as compared to was attributable to a decrease of approximately  in professional services and a decrease of approximately  in our provision for doubtful accounts due to improvements in our historical collection experience 
these decreases were offset by increases of approximately  in personnel related payroll and other expenses and approximately  primarily as a result of an increase in the annual premium for our directors and officers liability insurance coverage 
we expect general and administrative expenses in to increase as compared with as we anticipate increases in expenses for professional services and consultants 
interest income  net 
net interest income decreased to approximately  in from approximately  in  a decrease of approximately 
interest income decreased to approximately  in from approximately million in  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to lower cash and investment balances resulting from continued operating losses and our other uses of cash  and lower interest rates on our investments as a result of general interest rate declines 
interest expense decreased to approximately  in from approximately  in  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in interest expense in was a result of lower average outstanding debt obligations because we did not draw down on our lines of credit in as we did in we expect net interest income to decline in as compared with as a result of continuing low interest rates and a lower cash and investment balance 
net loss 
as a result of the factors discussed above  in we had a net loss of approximately million as compared with a net loss of approximately million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  percentage increase decrease in thousands except unit amounts revenue worldwide bis sensor bis monitor bis module kit other equipment and accessories total equipment total revenue unit analysis worldwide bis sensors bis monitors original equipment manufacturer bis modules installed base revenue 
we believe that the primary factor that contributed to the increase in revenue from the sale of equipment in as compared to was an increase of approximately in the sale of other equipment and accessories  particularly sales of the bis xp system upgrade kits 
additionally  we had an increase of 
table of contents approximately in bis monitor revenue 
the increase in bis monitor revenue resulted from an increase of approximately in the monitor average unit price partially offset by a decrease of approximately in monitor unit volume 
the decrease in monitor unit volume was primarily related to a reduction of sales in japan from units in to units in as nihon kohden delayed additional bis monitor purchases pending japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare approval of our bis xp system 
the increase in the monitor average unit price reflects an increase of approximately in the domestic average selling price of bis monitors in compared to offsetting the increase in bis monitor revenue was a decrease of approximately in revenue from the sale of bis module kits which resulted from a decrease of approximately in module unit volume in as compared to the increase in revenue from the sale of bis sensors from to was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately in the number of bis sensors sold as a result of growth in the installed base of bis monitors and bis modules and a slight increase in the average selling price of the bis sensors 
our installed base of bis monitors and bis modules increased approximately to  units at december  compared to  at december  our gross profit margin was approximately of revenue in as compared to a gross profit margin of approximately of revenue in the increase in gross profit margin percentage for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was a result of two factors 
first  we experienced increased sales of our bis sensors as a percentage of total revenue 
bis sensors have a higher gross margin than equipment 
second  we experienced an increase in the average worldwide selling price of bis monitors of approximately in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  expense overview percentage increase decrease in thousands expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative research and development 
the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to increases in research and development personnel and related payroll and other expenses of approximately  which included approximately  related to the reduction in force announced in november  consulting expenses of approximately  and approximately  in patent related expenses 
these increases were offset by a decrease in product development expenses of approximately  as a result of the completion of the development of our bis xp system and bis extend sensor and a decrease in clinical studies expenses of approximately  sales and marketing 
during  there were increases in expenses related to clinical education initiatives of approximately  and in operating expenses associated with our international subsidiaries of approximately million  of which approximately  was personnel and related payroll and other expenses 
the international personnel and related payroll expenses included approximately  of severance  including amounts related to the resignation in january of our vice president and managing director of international and the reduction of force announced in november these increases were offset by decreases in consulting expenses of approximately  expenses associated with increasing our name and brand awareness through advertising  public relations  tradeshows and the internet of approximately  and approximately  in sales and marketing personnel and related payroll and other expenses  net of approximately  related to the reduction in force 

table of contents general and administrative 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to was attributable to increases in professional and consulting expenses of approximately  insurance expense of approximately  and general and administrative personnel and related payroll and other expenses of approximately  the increases in general and administrative expenses were offset by decreases in investor relations expenses of approximately  and franchise  use and other tax expenses of approximately  interest income  net 
net interest income decreased to approximately  in from approximately million in  a decrease of approximately 
interest income decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to lower cash and investment balances resulting from continued operating losses and other uses of cash and lower interest rates on our investments as a result of general interest rate declines 
interest expense decreased to approximately  in from approximately  in  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in interest expense in was a result of the repayment of our equipment and term loans in may  lower average outstanding debt obligations resulting from payments under our other debt obligations  and lower interest rates on our working capital line of credit as compared to the equipment and term loans 
net loss 
as a result of the factors discussed above  in we had a net loss of approximately million as compared to a net loss of approximately million in quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth unaudited selected operating results for each of the eight fiscal quarters in the two years ended december  we believe that the following selected quarterly information includes all adjustments consisting only of normal  recurring adjustments that we consider necessary to present this information fairly 
this financial information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future 
therefore  results of operations for any previous periods are not necessarily indicative of results of operations to be recorded in the future 
quarter ended march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  in thousands revenue gross profit margin operating expenses net loss liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements have historically consisted of research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses  capital expenditures  working capital and general corporate expenses 
from our inception through january  we financed our operations primarily from the sale of our convertible preferred stock 
through december   we raised approximately million from private equity financings and received approximately million in equipment financing and approximately million of financing related to our investment in sales type leases 
we also received approximately million of financing under a term loan in december the outstanding principal on the equipment and term loans was paid in may in february  we closed our initial public offering of an aggregate of  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million 
in may  we entered into an agreement with fleet national bank  or fleet  for a million revolving line of credit  which expires in may the revolving line of credit with fleet contains restrictive covenants that require us to maintain liquidity and net worth ratios and is secured by certain of our 
table of contents investments  which are shown as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to maintain restricted cash and securities with a net equity value equal to of the million commitment 
interest on any borrowings under the revolving line of credit with fleet is  at our election  either the prime rate or at libor plus 
at december   the interest rate on the line of credit with fleet was 
up to million of the million revolving line of credit is available for standby letters of credit 
there was no outstanding balance under this line of credit at december  at december   we had standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of  we are currently in the process of renewing our line of credit agreement with fleet 
in august  we entered into a strategic alliance with boston scientific corporation whereby we sold  shares of our common stock at a purchase price per share of to boston scientific corporation 
gross cash proceeds from this sale of common stock were  note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k includes additional information relating to the strategic alliance with boston scientific corporation 
in august  we also entered into an agreement with boston scientific corporation for a revolving line of credit under which we are entitled to borrow up to million 
the revolving line of credit expires in august and may be extended at the discretion of boston scientific corporation 
interest on any borrowings under this revolving line of credit is at a rate equal to the libor rate at which boston scientific corporation  under its own revolving credit facility  is entitled to borrow funds  plus any additional amounts payable thereon by boston scientific corporation under such revolving credit facility  plus eighty basis points 
our revolving line of credit with boston scientific corporation is secured by our inventory and certain of our accounts receivable and contains certain restrictive covenants covering the collateral 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under this revolving line of credit 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity needs through the use of cash and short term investments on hand at december  we believe that the financial resources available to us  including our current working capital and available revolving lines of credit will be sufficient to finance our planned operations and capital expenditures through the end of however  our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the resources required to further develop our marketing and sales organization domestically and internationally  to finance our research and development programs  to implement new marketing programs  to finance our sales type lease program and to meet market demand for our products 
working capital at december  was approximately million compared to approximately million at december  the decrease in working capital from december  to december  was primarily attributable to our net loss of approximately million in we used approximately million of cash for operations in cash used for operations during this period was primarily driven by operating losses of approximately million  an increase in accounts receivable of approximately  due to increased sales  particularly in the fourth quarter of  an increase in our investment in sales type leases of approximately  and a decrease in deferred revenue of approximately  primarily related to the recognition of the deferred revenue related to the strategic alliance entered into with boston scientific corporation 
these were offset by decreases in inventory of approximately  and an increase of approximately  in accrued liabilities 
the decrease in inventory was a result of an initiative to promote lean manufacturing principles and as a result  inventory has decreased during the year 
we expect inventory levels to remain at similar levels  in relation to revenue  for the foreseeable future 
there was also approximately  of raw material components of monitors  which were written down to zero cost and subsequently scrapped or used for repair service 
the increase in accrued liabilities of  was driven by an increase in accrued bonus for  which was paid in january we used approximately million for operations during the three years ended december   which was primarily driven by operating losses 
the operating losses were offset by a decrease in inventory of approximately million due to improved inventory management and a net increase in deferred revenue of approximately million primarily related to proceeds received in connection with the strategic alliance entered into in august 
table of contents we received approximately million of cash from investing activities in the cash received from investing activities in was primarily the result of the sales and maturities of our investments in marketable securities 
we received approximately million  net  of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and invested approximately  primarily related to expenditures for the purchase of computer hardware and third party software and machinery and equipment 
we received approximately million for investing activities during the three years ended december  primarily as a result of net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of approximately million offset by an increase in restricted cash of approximately million and approximately million in expenditures for manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and computer hardware and third party software 
we used approximately  of cash for financing activities in primarily as a result of payments of principal on debt related to our investment in sales type leases of approximately  offset by proceeds from the issuance of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options granted under our stock option plans and for purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of approximately  and proceeds from the sale of our investment in sales type leases of approximately  we received approximately million of cash from financing activities during the three years ended december  cash provided by financing activities during this period was primarily the result of proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in connection with a strategic alliance entered into in august  and the sale of a portion of our investment in sales type leases  offset by payments on our equipment loan  term loan and debt related to our investment in sales type leases 
we guarantee certain operating lease obligations of our subsidiaries of approximately  for the lease of automobiles 
in july  we entered into an agreement under which we can sell a portion of our existing and future investment in sales type leases to americorp financial  inc through december   we sold approximately million of our investment in sales type leases 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
 the proceeds from these sales are classified as debt 
payments on the outstanding principal under this debt match the timing of the payments due on the underlying investment in sales type leases 
at december   approximately million is recorded as debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
we had capital expenditures of approximately  for the year ended december   which related primarily to improvements to our information systems through the purchase of computer hardware and third party software 
at december   we had entered into an agreement to purchase a piece of manufacturing equipment for use in the production of our bis sensors 
we anticipate that the level of capital expenditures in will increase from the level of capital expenditures during the year ended december  mostly as a result of the expected purchase of this manufacturing equipment 
we have summarized below our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period less than one to three three to five after five contractual obligations total one year years years years operating leases debt related to the sale of investment in sales type leases total contractual cash obligations off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which 
table of contents are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
income taxes we have net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  and  respectively  at december  that began expiring in and will continue to expire through if not utilized 
the net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards are subject to review by the internal revenue service 
ownership changes  as defined under sections and in the internal revenue code  may limit the amount of these tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities 
the amount of the annual limitation is determined based on our value immediately prior to the ownership change 
subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years 
effects of inflation we believe that inflation and changing prices over the past three years have not had a significant impact on our revenue or on our results of operations 
conversion to euro twelve of the members of the european union have adopted the euro as their legal currency 
our current information systems allow us to process euro denominated transactions 
we are also assessing the business implications of the conversion to the euro  including long term competitive implications and the effect of market risk with respect to financial instruments 
the majority of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
we do not believe the euro has had a significant effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  the expenses and capital spending of our international subsidiaries are transacted in the respective country s local currency 
as a result  changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets could affect our financial condition or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
and apb no 
 interim financial reporting  to present alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily adopts the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and provides modifications to the disclosure provisions to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation in quarterly and annual financial statements 
at this time  we have not voluntarily adopted the fair value method of accounting under sfas no 
however  appropriate disclosures about the effects on reported net loss of our accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation is reported in our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no

factors affecting future operating results this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements  including information relating to our ability to achieve profitability  information with respect to market acceptance of our bis system  continued growth in sales of our bis monitors  bis module kits and bis sensors  our dependence on the bis system  our ability to remain competitive and achieve future growth  information with respect to other plans and strategies for our business and factors that may influence our revenue for each fiscal quarter in and for the year ending december  the following important factors represent current challenges to us that create risk and uncertainty 
failure to adequately overcome any of the following challenges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  business or financial condition 
we will not be profitable if hospitals and anesthesia providers do not buy and use our bis system in sufficient quantities 
our customers may determine that the cost of the bis system exceeds cost savings in drugs  personnel and post anesthesia care recovery resulting from use of the bis system 
in addition  hospitals and anesthesia providers may not accept the bis system as an accurate means of assessing a patient s level of consciousness during surgery or in the intensive care unit 
if extensive or frequent malfunctions occur  these providers may also conclude that the bis system is unreliable 
if hospitals and anesthesia providers do not accept the bis system as cost effective  accurate and reliable  they will not buy and use the bis system in sufficient quantities to enable us to be profitable 
the success of our business also depends in a large part on continued use of the bis system by our customers and  accordingly  sales by us of bis sensors 
we expect that over time sales of bis sensors will increase as a percentage of our revenue as compared to sales of equipment as we build our installed base of monitors and modules 
if use of our bis system  and accordingly  sales of our bis sensors  do not increase  it could adversely affect our revenue 
we depend on our bis system for substantially all of our revenue  and if the bis system does not gain widespread market acceptance  then our revenue will not grow 
we began selling our current bis system in early and introduced the latest version  the bis xp system  at the end of the third fiscal quarter of in  we introduced commercially the bis extend sensor for patients who are monitored over an extended period of time  such as in intensive care unit settings 
to date  we have not achieved widespread market acceptance of the bis system for use in the operating room or in the intensive care unit 
because we depend on our bis system for substantially all of our revenue and we have no other significant products  if we fail to achieve widespread market acceptance for the bis system  we will not be able to sustain or grow our product revenue 

table of contents various market factors may adversely affect our quarterly operating results through the first fiscal quarter of and for the year ending december  various factors may adversely affect our quarterly operating results through the first fiscal quarter of and the year ending december  first  we continue to shift the focus of our placements from bis monitors to bis modules which may lead to a reduction in equipment revenue and gross margin on equipment 
second  in japan  nihon kohden is awaiting approval of the bis xp system from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare which may cause delays in purchasing decisions by customers in japan  or these potential customers may choose not to purchase our products 
third  on november   our international master distribution agreement with datex ohmeda expired 
we are currently replacing this agreement with country specific distribution agreements with datex ohmeda sales subsidiaries and other distributors in various countries 
a delay in signing these country specific distribution agreements may adversely affect equipment revenue in the international market 
the continuation of difficult worldwide economic conditions  reductions in hospital purchasing programs and the cost of transitioning our installed base to the bis xp system may also adversely impact our revenue and operating results through the first fiscal quarter of and for the year ending december  fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could cause our stock price to decrease 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
these fluctuations are due to several factors relating to the sale of our products  including the timing and volume of customer orders for our bis system  implementation of  and our subsequent reduction on the focus of  our ep program  use of and demand for our bis sensors  transition of sales focus from bis monitors to bis module kits  customer cancellations  introduction of competitive products  regulatory approvals  changes in management  turnover in our direct sales force  effectiveness of new marketing and sales programs  reductions in orders by our distributors and original equipment manufacturers  and the timing and amount of our expenses 
because of these fluctuations  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results could again fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if our quarterly operating results are below expectations in the future  the market price of our common stock would also likely decrease 
in addition  because we do not have a significant backlog of customer orders for our bis system  revenue in any quarter depends on orders received in that quarter 
our quarterly results may also be adversely affected because some customers may have inadequate financial resources to purchase our products or may fail to pay for our products after receiving them 
in particular  hospitals are increasingly experiencing financial constraints  consolidations and reorganizations as a result of cost containment measures and declining third party reimbursement for services  which may result in decreased product orders or an increase in bad debts in any quarter 

table of contents if the estimates we make  and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate  our actual results may vary from those reflected in our projections and accruals 
our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance  however  that our estimates  or the assumptions underlying them  will be correct 
if approval of our bis xp system is not obtained in japan  our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected 
in japan  nihon kohden is awaiting approval of the bis xp system from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare 
until approval is obtained  customers in japan may delay their purchasing decisions with respect to our products or may decide not to purchase our products at all 
as a result  if approval for this product is not obtained in japan in the near future  or at all  it could limit the growth of our international revenue 
we may need additional financing for our future capital needs and may not be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we believe that the financial resources available to us  including our current working capital and available revolving lines of credit  will be sufficient to finance our planned operations and capital expenditures through the end of if we are unable to increase our revenue and achieve positive cash flow  we will need to raise additional funds 
we may also need additional financing if we need additional cash to fund research and development costs of products currently under development  we decide to expand faster than currently planned  we develop new or enhanced services or products ahead of schedule  we decide to undertake new sales and or marketing initiatives  we are required to defend or enforce our intellectual property rights  sales of our products do not meet our expectations in the united states or internationally  we need to respond to competitive pressures  or we decide to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fund our future needs which would significantly limit our ability to implement our business plan 
in addition  we may have to issue securities that may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
cases of awareness with recall during monitoring with the bis system could limit market acceptance of bis systems and could expose us to product liability claims 
clinicians have reported to us cases of possible awareness with recall during surgical procedures monitored with the bis system 
in most of the cases that were reported to us  when bis index values were recorded at the time of awareness  high bis index values were noted  indicating that the bis index correctly identified the increased risk of awareness with recall in these patients 
however  in a small number of these reported cases  awareness with recall may not have been detected by monitoring with the bis system 
we have not systematically solicited reports of awareness with recall 
it is possible that additional cases of 
table of contents awareness with recall during surgical procedures monitored with the bis system have not been reported to us 
anesthesia providers and hospitals may elect not to purchase and use bis systems if there is adverse publicity resulting from the report of cases of awareness with recall that were not detected during procedures monitored with the bis system 
if anesthesia providers and hospitals do not purchase and use the bis system  then we may not sustain or grow our product revenue 
although clinical studies have demonstrated that patient monitoring with the bis system may reduce the incidence of awareness with recall we may be subject to product liability claims for cases of awareness with recall during surgical procedures monitored with the bis system 
these claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
data that was collected in our three multi center  multinational studies to assess the incidence of awareness with recall and the impact of bis monitoring were reported during results from these studies demonstrate that awareness with recall occurs in approximately to cases per  patients during general anesthesia 
use of bis monitoring to help guide anesthetic administration may be associated with the reduction of the incidence of awareness with recall in adults using general anesthesia and sedation 
if the patient safety benefits of bis monitoring are not persuasive enough to lead to wider adoption of our bis technology  our business could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to compete with new products or alternative techniques developed by others  which could impair our ability to remain competitive and achieve future growth 
the medical industry in which we market our products is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances 
our competitors have introduced commercially three anesthesia monitoring products approved by the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
if we do not compete effectively with these monitoring products  our revenue will be adversely affected 
our current or planned products are at risk of obsolescence from other new monitoring products  based on new or improved technologies  new products or technologies used on patients or in the operating room during surgery in lieu of monitoring devices  electrical or mechanical interference from new or existing products or technologies  alternative techniques for evaluating the effects of anesthesia  significant changes in the methods of delivering anesthesia  and the development of new anesthetic agents 
we may not be able to improve our products or develop new products or technologies quickly enough to maintain a competitive position in our markets and continue to grow our business 
if we do not successfully develop and introduce enhanced or new products we could lose revenue opportunities and customers 
as the market for our bis system matures  we need to develop and introduce new products for anesthesia monitoring or other applications 
in  we introduced commercially the bis extend sensor for patients who are typically monitored for an extended period of time  such as in intensive care unit settings 
we do not know whether the use of the bis system in the intensive care unit will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  we have begun to research the use of bis monitoring to diagnose and track neurological diseases  and face at least the following two related risks we may not successfully adapt the bis system to function properly for procedural sedation  when used with anesthetics we have not tested or with patient populations we have not studied  such as infants  and our technology is complex  and we may not be able to develop it further for applications outside anesthesia monitoring  such as the diagnosis and tracking of neurological diseases 

table of contents if we do not successfully adapt the bis system for new products and applications both within and outside the field of anesthesia monitoring  or if such products and applications are developed but not successfully commercialized  then we could lose revenue opportunities and customers 
if we do not develop and implement a successful sales and marketing strategy  we will not expand our business 
in the past  we have experienced high turnover in our direct sales force 
it is possible that high turnover may occur in the future 
if new sales representatives do not acquire the technological skills to sell our products in a timely and successful manner or we experience high turnover in our direct sales force  we may not be able to sustain and grow our product revenue 
on an ongoing basis  we develop and introduce new sales and marketing programs 
if we do not implement these new sales and marketing programs in a timely and successful manner  we may not be able to achieve the level of market awareness and sales required to expand our business 
we have only limited sales and marketing experience both in the united states and internationally and may not be successful in developing and implementing our strategy 
we need to provide or assure that distributors and original equipment manufacturers provide the technical and educational support customers need to use the bis system successfully  promote frequent use of the bis system so that sales of our disposable bis sensors increase  establish and implement successful marketing and sales programs that encourage our customers to purchase our products or the products that are made by original equipment manufacturers incorporating our technology  manage geographically dispersed operations  and modify our products and marketing and sales programs for foreign markets 
in order to reach the level of sales we need to achieve profitability  we need to further develop our direct and indirect sales channels 
in order to increase our sales  we need to continue to strengthen our relationships with our international distributors and continue to add international distributors 
we need to also continue to strengthen our relationships with our original equipment manufacturers and other sales channels and increase sales through these channels 
on an ongoing basis we develop and implement new sales and marketing programs and clinical education programs to promote the use of the bis system by our customers 
if we do not further develop our direct and indirect sales channels and successfully implement the new sales and marketing programs and clinical education programs that encourage our customers to purchase and use our products  we will not reach the level of sales necessary to achieve profitability our third party distribution and original equipment manufacturer relationships could negatively affect our profitability  cause sales of our products to decline and be difficult to terminate if we are dissatisfied 
sales through distributors could be less profitable than direct sales 
sales of our products through multiple channels could also confuse customers and cause the sale of our products to decline 
we do not control our original equipment manufacturers and distribution partners 
our partners could sell competing products  may not incorporate our technology into their products in a timely manner and may devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
in addition  our partners are generally not required to purchase minimum quantities 
as a result  even if we are dissatisfied with the performance of our partners  we may be unable to terminate our agreements with these partners or enter into alternative arrangements 
we may not be able to generate enough additional revenue from our international expansion to offset the costs associated with establishing and maintaining foreign operations 
a component of our growth strategy is to expand our presence in foreign markets 
we conduct international business primarily in europe and japan and we are attempting to increase the number of 
table of contents countries in which we do business 
it is costly to establish international facilities and operations and to promote the bis system in international markets 
we have encountered barriers to the sale of our bis system outside the united states  including less acceptance by anesthesia providers for use of disposable products  such as bis sensors  delays in regulatory approvals outside of the united states  particularly in japan  and difficulties selling through indirect sales channels 
in addition  we have little experience in marketing and distributing products in these markets 
revenue from international activities may not offset the expense of establishing and maintaining these foreign operations 
we may not be able to meet the unique operational  legal and financial challenges that we will encounter in our international operations  which may limit the growth of our business 
we are increasingly subject to a number of challenges which specifically relate to our international business activities 
these challenges include failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  which could slow our growth in international markets  difficulties in terminating or modifying distributor arrangements because of restrictions in markets outside the united states  less acceptance by foreign anesthesia providers of the use of disposable products similar to the bis sensors  delays in regulatory approval of our products  currency conversion issues arising from sales denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  longer sales cycles to sell products like the bis system to hospitals and outpatient surgical centers  which could slow our revenue growth from international sales  and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
if we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges  our international operations may not be successful which would limit the growth of our business 
we may experience customer dissatisfaction and our reputation could suffer if we fail to manufacture enough products to meet our customers demands 
we rely on third party manufacturers to assemble and manufacture the components of our bis monitors  bis module kits and a portion of our bis sensors 
we manufacture substantially all bis sensors in our own manufacturing facility 
we have only one manufacturing facility 
if we fail to produce enough products at our own manufacturing facility or at a third party manufacturing facility or experience a termination or modification of any manufacturing arrangement with a third party  we may be unable to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
our failure to deliver products on a timely basis could lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation 
our reliance on sole source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers demands for our products in a timely manner or within budget 
some of the components that are necessary for the assembly of our bis system  including some of the components used in our bis sensors  are currently provided to us by sole source suppliers or a limited group of suppliers 
we purchase components through purchase orders rather than long term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory 
we have experienced shortages and delays in obtaining 
table of contents some of the components of our bis systems in the past  and we may experience similar shortages or delays in the future 
the disruption or termination of the supply of components could cause a significant increase in the costs of these components  which could affect our profitability 
a disruption or termination in the supply of components could also result in our inability to meet demand for our products  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation 
furthermore  if we are required to change the manufacturer of a key component of the bis system  we may be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines 
the delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could delay our ability to manufacture bis systems in a timely manner or within budget 
we may be required to bring litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  which may result in substantial expense and may divert our attention from the implementation of our business strategy 
we believe that the success of our business depends  in part  on obtaining patent protection for our products  defending our patents once obtained and preserving our trade secrets 
we rely on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures and patent  trademark and trade secret laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
these legal measures afford only limited protection and competitors may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary information 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
any litigation could result in substantial expense and diversion of our attention from the growth of the business and may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property rights 
we may be sued by third parties which claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights  particularly because there is substantial uncertainty about the validity and breadth of medical device patents 
we may be exposed to litigation by third parties based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not valid  could result in substantial costs  could place a significant strain on our financial resources and could harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which would adversely affect our revenue  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  and redesign our products  which would be costly and time consuming 
we could be exposed to significant product liability claims which could divert management attention and adversely affect our cash balances  our ability to obtain and maintain insurance coverage at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts and our reputation 
the manufacture and sale of our products expose us to product liability claims and product recalls  including those which may arise from misuse or malfunction of  or design flaws in  our products or use of our products with components or systems not manufactured or sold by us 
product liability claims or product recalls  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
we currently maintain product liability insurance  however  it may not cover the costs of any product liability claims made against us 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
in addition  publicity pertaining to the misuse or malfunction of  or design flaws in  our products could impair our ability to successfully market and sell our products 

table of contents several class action lawsuits have been filed against the underwriters of our initial public offering which may result in negative publicity and potential litigation against us that would be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and may harm our business 
the underwriters of our initial public offering are named as defendants in several class action complaints which have been filed allegedly on behalf of certain persons who purchased shares of our common stock between january  and december  these complaints allege violations of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of primarily they allege that there was undisclosed compensation received by our underwriters in connection with our initial public offering 
while we and our officers and directors have not been named as defendants in these suits  based on comparable lawsuits filed against other companies  there can be no assurance that we and our officers and directors will not be named in similar complaints in the future 
in addition  the underwriters may assert that we are liable for some or all of any liability that they are found to have to the plaintiffs  pursuant to the indemnification provisions of the underwriting agreement we entered into as part of the initial public offering  or otherwise 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of these complaints or any potential suit against us or our officers and directors 
any conclusion of these matters in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the costs to us of defending any litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
even if we are not named as defendants in these lawsuits  we may also be required to incur significant costs and our management may be distracted by being required to provide information  documents or testimony in connection with the actions against our underwriters 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation or other proceedings and the negative publicity associated with this litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace 
boston scientific corporation may be able to impact corporate actions requiring stockholder approval because it owns a significant amount of our common stock  and  if our strategic alliance with boston scientific corporation is not successful  our operating results will be adversely affected 
as of march   boston scientific corporation owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
we have an agreement with boston scientific corporation  pursuant to which boston scientific corporation has agreed not to acquire any shares of our common stock in excess of of the outstanding shares of our common stock prior to december  without our prior approval 
if boston scientific corporation increases its ownership of our outstanding common stock  it may impact corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
in addition  on august   we formed a strategic alliance with boston scientific corporation 
in connection with this strategic alliance  we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we granted boston scientific corporation an option to distribute newly developed technology for monitoring patients under sedation in a range of less invasive medical specialties 
if such products are not successfully developed  marketed and sold under the agreement in a manner consistent with our expectations  the growth of our business and our operating results will be adversely affected 
even if we successfully develop new sedation management technology for less invasive medical procedures  aspect and boston scientific corporation may not successfully market and sell this new technology 
we may not reserve amounts adequate to cover product obsolescence  claims and returns  which could result in unanticipated expenses and fluctuations in operating results 
depending on factors such as the timing of our introduction of new products which utilize our bis technology  as well as warranty claims and product returns  we may need to reserve amounts in excess of those currently reserved for product obsolescence  excess inventory  warranty claims and product returns 
these reserves may not be adequate to cover all costs associated with these items 
if these reserves are inadequate  we would be required to incur unanticipated expenses which could result in unexpected fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

table of contents we may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in price reductions and decreased demand for our products 
we are facing increased competition in the domestic level of consciousness monitoring market as a result of three competitors monitoring systems which have been approved by the fda 
these products are marketed by well established medical products companies with significant resources 
we may not be able to compete effectively with these and other potential competitors 
we may also face substantial competition from companies which may develop sensor products that compete with our proprietary bis sensors for use with our bis monitors or with third party monitoring systems or anesthesia delivery systems that incorporate the bis index 
we also expect to face competition from companies currently marketing conventional electroencephalogram  or eeg  monitors using standard and novel signal processing techniques 
other companies may develop anesthesia monitoring systems that perform better than the bis system and or sell for less 
in addition  one or more of our competitors may develop products that are substantially equivalent to our fda approved products  in which case they may be able to use our products as predicate devices to more quickly obtain fda approval of their competing products 
medical device companies developing these and other competitive products may have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
competition in the sale of anesthesia monitoring systems could result in price reductions  fewer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
our ability to market and sell our products and generate revenue depends upon receipt of domestic and foreign regulatory approval of our products and manufacturing operations 
before we can market new products in the united states  we must obtain clearance from the fda 
if the fda concludes that any of our products do not meet the requirements to obtain clearance of a premarket notification under section k of the food  drug and cosmetic act  then we would be required to file a premarket approval application 
the approval process for a premarket approval application is lengthy  expensive and typically requires extensive preclinical and clinical trial data 
we may not obtain clearance of a k notification or approval of a premarket approval application with respect to any of our products on a timely basis  if at all 
if we fail to obtain timely clearance or approval for our products  we will not be able to market and sell our products  which will limit our ability to generate revenue 
we may also be required to obtain clearance of a k notification from the fda before we can market certain previously marketed products which we modify after they have been cleared 
we have made certain enhancements to our currently marketed products which we have determined do not necessitate the filing of a new k notification 
however  if the fda does not agree with our determination  it will require us to file a new k notification for the modification and we may be prohibited from marketing the modified device until we obtain fda clearance 
the fda also requires us to adhere to current good manufacturing practices regulations  which include production design controls  testing  quality control  storage and documentation procedures 
the fda may at any time inspect our facilities to determine whether adequate compliance has been achieved 
compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations for medical devices is difficult and costly 
in addition  we may not continue to be compliant as a result of future changes in  or interpretations of  regulations by the fda or other regulatory agencies 
if we do not achieve continued compliance  the fda may withdraw marketing clearance or require product recall 
when any change or modification is made to a device or its intended use  the manufacturer may be required to reassess compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations  which may cause interruptions or delays in the marketing and sale of our products 
sales of our products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be longer than that required for fda approval  and requirements for foreign licensing may differ from fda requirements 
the federal  state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to future changes  as are administrative interpretations of regulatory agencies 
if we fail to comply with applicable federal  state or foreign laws or regulations  we could be subject to enforcement actions  including product seizures  recalls  withdrawal of clearances or approvals and civil and criminal penalties 

table of contents if we do not retain our senior management and other key employees  we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy 
our president and chief executive officer  nassib chamoun  joined us at our inception in our chairman  j 
breckenridge eagle  began serving as a director in many other members of our management and key employees have extensive experience with us and other companies in the medical device industry 
our success is substantially dependent on the ability  experience and performance of these members of our senior management and other key employees 
because of their ability and experience  if we lose one or more of the members of our senior management or other key employees  our ability to successfully implement our business strategy could be seriously harmed 
if we do not attract and retain skilled personnel  we will not be able to expand our business 
our products are based on complex signal processing technology 
accordingly  we require skilled personnel to develop  manufacture  sell and support our products 
our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire  train  retain and motivate additional skilled personnel  particularly sales representatives who are responsible for customer education and training and post installation customer support 
consequently  if we are not able to attract and retain skilled personnel  we will not be able to expand our business 
failure of users of the bis system to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors could limit market acceptance of the bis system  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
anesthesia providers are generally not reimbursed separately for patient monitoring activities utilizing the bis system 
for hospitals and outpatient surgical centers  when reimbursement is based on charges or costs  patient monitoring with the bis system may reduce reimbursements for surgical procedures  because charges or costs may decline as a result of monitoring with the bis system 
failure by hospitals and other users of the bis system to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors  or any reduction in the reimbursement by third party payors to hospitals and other users as a result of using the bis system could limit market acceptance of the bis system  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate exposure our investment portfolio consists primarily of high grade commercial paper  high grade corporate bonds and debt obligations of various governmental agencies 
we manage our investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs  and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
investments are made with an average maturity of months or less and a maximum maturity of months 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of the debt instruments  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
our investment policy specifies the credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investment in sales type leases  line of credit agreements and sales type lease debt agreements are also subject to market risk 
the interest rates implicit in our sales type leases and on our sales type lease debt agreements are fixed and not subject to interest rate risk 
the interest rates on our line of credit agreements are variable and subject to interest rate risk 
the interest rate risk related to the lines of credit is mitigated primarily by the fact that the lines of credit  when drawn on  are generally outstanding for short periods of time in order to fund short term cash requirements 

table of contents foreign currency exposure most of our revenue  expenses and capital spending are transacted in us dollars 
the expenses and capital spending of our two international subsidiaries are transacted in the respective country s local currency and subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our foreign currency transactions are translated into us dollars at prevailing rates 
gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in current period income or loss as incurred 
currently  all material transactions are denominated in us dollars  and we have not entered into any material transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies
