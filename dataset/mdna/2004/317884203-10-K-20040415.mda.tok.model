management believes that current trends in jewelry retailing provide a significant opportunity for finlay s growth 
consumers spent approximately billion on jewelry including both fine jewelry and costume jewelry in the united states in  an increase of approximately billion over  according to the united states department of commerce 
in the department store sector in which finlay operates  consumers spent an estimated billion on fine jewelry in management believes that demographic factors such as the aging of the baby boomer generation with increased discretionary income  plus the growing number of women in the workplace  will contribute to the growth of the fine jewelry retailing industry 
opportunities  risks and uncertainties finlay achieved sustained growth during  however  the company has faced certain challenges as well  including o dependence on or loss of certain host store relationships  and o host store consolidation

during  approximately and of finlay s sales were generated by departments operated in store groups owned by may and federated  respectively

nevertheless  a decision by either company to transfer the operation of some or all of their departments to a competitor or to assume the operation of those departments themselves would have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of finlay 
additionally  the department store industry may experience significant consolidations in the future 
although finlay has  in the past  generally benefited from host store consolidations  there is no assurance that finlay s host store relationships will not be impacted as a result of such host store consolidation

inflation the effect of inflation on finlay s results of operations has not been material in the periods discussed 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain financial statement accounts reported and disclosed at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
certain of the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies  which are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
the company is not aware of any likely events or circumstances which would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
merchandise inventories the company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the cost is determined by the last in  first out method utilizing selected producer price indices published for jewelry and watches by the bureau of labor statistics 
factors related to inventories such as future consumer demand and the economy s impact on consumer discretionary spending  inventory aging  ability to return merchandise to vendors  merchandise condition and anticipated markdowns are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
an adjustment is recorded to reduce the lifo cost of inventories  if required 
any significant unanticipated changes in the factors above could have a significant impact on the value of the inventories and the company s reported operating results 
shrinkage is estimated for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal year on a store by store basis 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is the basis for estimating shrink 
derivative instruments the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in the price of gold and at times enters into forward contracts  to hedge against the risk of gold price fluctuations 
when specific criteria as required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  have been met  changes in the fair value of forward contracts are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into cost of sales when the offsetting effects of the hedged transaction impact earnings 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward contract amount may not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
changes in the fair value of the derivative attributable to hedge ineffectiveness are reclassified from other comprehensive income to other income expense during the period in which such changes occur 
vendor allowances the company receives allowances from its vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including cooperative advertising 
vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales upon the sale of merchandise or sg a when the purpose for which the vendor funds were intended to be used has been fulfilled 
accordingly  a reduction or increase in vendor allowances has an inverse impact on cost of sales and or sg a 
effective in  the company adopted eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
eitf addresses the accounting treatment for vendor allowances and provides that cash consideration received from a vendor should be presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendors product and should therefore be shown as a reduction in the purchase price of the merchandise 
further  these allowances should be recognized as a reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold 
to the extent that the cash consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific  incremental and identifiable cost  then those vendor allowances should be used to offset such costs 
finite lived assets finite lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the finite lived assets are less than the carrying value  the company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
the company determines the fair value of the underlying asset based upon the discounted future cash flows of the assets 
various factors  including future sales growth and profit margins  are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or the company s strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
goodwill the company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
to the extent these future cash flows or the company s strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from current estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon the sale of merchandise  either owned or consigned  to its customers  net of anticipated returns 
the provision for sales returns is based on the company s historical return rate 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured for workers compensation claims up to a certain maximum liability amount 
although the amount accrued is actuarially determined based on analysis of historical trends of losses  settlements  litigation costs and other factors  the amount that the company will ultimately disburse could differ materially from the accrued amount 
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions and must first determine which revenues and expenses should be included in each taxing jurisdiction 
this process involves the estimation of the company s actual current tax exposure  together with the assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of income or expense items for tax and accounting purposes 
the company establishes tax reserves in its consolidated financial statements based on its estimation of current tax exposures 
if the company prevails in tax matters for which reserves have been established or the company is required to settle matters in excess of established reserves  the effective tax rate for a particular period could be materially affected
