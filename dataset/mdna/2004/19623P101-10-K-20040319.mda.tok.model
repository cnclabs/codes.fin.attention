the company colony bankcorp  inc colony is a bank holding company headquartered in fitzgerald  georgia that provides  through its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively referred to as the company  a broad array of products and services throughout georgia markets 
the company offers commercial  consumer and mortgage banking services 
application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the company s financial position and or results of operations 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complete 
part ii continued item continued allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses provides coverage for probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses quarterly based on changes  if any  in underwriting activities  the loan portfolio composition including product mix and geographic  industry or customer specific concentrations  trends in loan performance  regulatory guidance and economic factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires the use of significant management estimates 
many factors can affect management s estimates of specific and expected losses  including volatility of default probabilities  collateral values  rating migrations  loss severity and economic and political conditions 
the allowance is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge offs 
the company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the allowance recorded for commercial loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and historical loss experience 
the allowance recorded for homogeneous consumer loans is based on an analysis of loan mix  risk characteristics of the portfolio  and historical losses  adjusted for current trends  for each homogeneous category or group of loans 
the allowance for loan losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan s observable market price  the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans  or the discounted cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate 
regardless of the extent of the company s analysis of customer performance  portfolio trends or risk management processes  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio 
this is due to several factors  including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends 
volatility of economic or customer specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger nonhomogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogeneous groups of loans are among other factors 
the company estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures 
the estimates are based upon the company s evaluation of risk associated with the commercial and consumer levels and the estimated impact of the current economic environment 
goodwill and other intangibles the company records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas goodwill is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight line and accelerated methods  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired asset will perform in the future 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  customer attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  specific industry conditions and changes in competition 
part ii continued item continued overview the following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors affecting the company s financial condition as of december  and  and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
all of the acquisitions during the reported periods were accounted for as purchase transactions  and as such  their related results of operations are included from the date of acquisition 
colony bank quitman formerly quitman federal savings bank acquired on march contributed thousand to net income in  or percent of total net income and contributed million to net income in  or percent of total net income 
colony bank quitman closed on december  at million in total assets  or percent of total assets and closed on december  at million in total assets  or percent of total assets 
prior year financial statements have been restated to de consolidate the company s investment in colony bankcorp statutory trusts i and ii in connection with the implementation of a new accounting standard related to variable interest entities during taxable equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax free loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a percent federal tax rate  thus making tax exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields 
dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands  except for per share amounts 
results of operations the company s results of operations are determined by its ability to effectively manage interest income and expense  to minimize loan and investment losses  to generate noninterest income and to control noninterest expense 
since market forces and economic conditions beyond the control of the company determine interest rates  the ability to generate net interest income is dependent upon the company s ability to obtain an adequate spread between the rate earned on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
thus  the key performance for net interest income is the interest margin or net yield  which is taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets 
net income totaled million  or diluted per common share in compared to million  or diluted per common share in and million  or diluted per common share in part ii continued item continued selected income statement data  returns on average assets and average equity and dividends per share for the comparable periods were as follows taxable equivalent net interest income taxable equivalent adjustment net interest income provision for possible loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income basic per common share net income diluted per common share net income return on average assets net income return on average equity net income income from operations for increased million  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in net interest income and a million increase in noninterest income 
the impact of these items was partly offset by a million increase in noninterest expense  an increase of million in the provision for possible loan losses and a million increase in income tax expense 
income from operations for increased million  or percent compared to the increase was primarily due to a million increase in net interest income and a million increase in noninterest income 
the impact of these items was partly offset by a million increase in noninterest expense  a million increase in the provision for possible loan losses and a million increase in income tax expense 
part ii continued item continued details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed as follows net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense on liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings  which are used to fund those assets 
net interest income is the company s largest source of revenue  representing percent of total revenue during net interest margin is the taxable equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets for the period 
the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin 
the federal reserve board influences the general market rates of interest  including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions 
the company s loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate 
the prime interest rate  which is the rate offered on loans to borrowers with strong credit  began at percent and decreased basis points in the first quarter  decreased basis points in the second quarter  decreased basis points in the third quarter and decreased basis points in the fourth quarter to end the year at percent 
during  the prime rate remained at percent until the fourth quarter when the rate decreased basis points to percent 
during  the prime rate remained at percent until the end of the second quarter  when the rate decreased basis points to percent 
the federal funds rate  which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds  decreased in a similar manner 
it began at percent and decreased basis points over the course of the year  and it began at percent and decreased basis points in the fourth quarter 
during  the federal funds rate remained at percent until the end of the second quarter  when the rate decreased basis points to percent 
the following table presents the changes in taxable equivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities 
the changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each 
the company s consolidated average balance sheets along with an analysis of taxable equivalent net interest earnings are presented in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this report 
part ii continued item continued rate volume analysis the rate volume analysis presented hereafter illustrates the change from year to year for each component of the taxable equivalent net interest income separated into the amount generated through volume changes and the amount generated by changes in the yields rates 
changes from to a changes from to a in thousands volume rate total volume rate total interest income loans  net taxable investment securities taxable tax exempt total investment securities interest bearing deposits in other banks funds sold other interest earning assets total interest income interest expense interest bearing demand and savings deposits time deposits other interest bearing liabilities funds purchased and securities under agreement to repurchase trust preferred securities other debt total interest expense benefit net interest income a changes in net interest income for the periods  based on either changes in average balances or changes in average rates for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  are shown on this table 
during each year  there are numerous and simultaneous balance and rate changes  therefore  it is not possible to precisely allocate the changes between balances and rates 
for the purpose of this table  changes that are not exclusively due to balance changes or rate changes have been attributed to rates 
part ii continued item continued our financial performance is impacted by  among other factors  interest rate risk and credit risk 
we do not utilize derivatives to mitigate our credit risk  relying instead on an extensive loan review process and our allowance for loan losses 
interest rate risk is the change in value due to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes and  accordingly  the company manages exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
the company does not have any trading instruments nor does it classify any portion of its investment portfolio as held for trading 
the company does not engage in any hedging activity or utilize any derivatives 
the company has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other market risks 
this risk is addressed by our asset liability management committee alco which includes senior management representatives 
the alco monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact to the net portfolio of equity value and net interest income from potential changes to interest rates and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of financial institutions 
the repricing of interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is gap management and our company has established its policy to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon of 
to 
our exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by our board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine our change in net portfolio value in the event of assumed changes in interest rates 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations  we have implemented strategies to more closely match our balance sheet composition 
we are generally focusing our investment activities on securities with terms or average lives in the year range 
the company maintains about one third of its loan portfolio in adjustable rate loans that reprice with prime rate changes  while the bulk of its other loans mature within years 
the liabilities to fund assets are primarily in short term certificates of deposit that mature within one year 
this balance sheet composition has allowed the company to be relatively constant with its net interest margin the past several years  though the unprecedented basis point decrease by us federal reserve in  basis point decrease in and basis point decrease in resulted in significant net interest margin pressure 
net interest margin increased to percent for compared to percent in and percent in we anticipate continued improvement or stability in the net interest margin for given the federal reserve s present neutral interest rates forecast for the balance of part ii continued item continued taxable equivalent net interest income for increased million  or percent  compared to  while taxable equivalent net interest income for increased by million  or percent compared to the significant fluctuation between the comparable periods resulted from the positive impact of growth in the average volume of earning assets that was partially offset by the negative impact of declining average interest rates 
the average volume of earning assets during increased almost million compared to while over the same period the net interest margin increased by basis points from percent to percent 
similarly  the average volume of earning assets during increased million compared to while over the same period the net interest margin decreased basis points from percent to percent 
growth in average earning assets during and was primarily in loans 
the slight increase in the net interest margin in and the decrease in net interest margin during was primarily the result of the general decline in market interest rates and the compression resulting from disproportionately larger decreases in the yields in earning assets 
the average volume of loans increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to the average yield on loans decreased basis points in compared to and basis points in compared to funding for this growth was primarily provided by deposit growth 
the average volume of deposits increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to interest bearing deposits made up percent of the growth in average deposits in and percent of the growth in average deposits in accordingly  the ratio of average interest bearing deposits to total average deposits was percent in  percent in and percent in this deposit mix  combined with a general decline in market rates  had the effect of i reducing the average cost of total deposits by basis points in compared to and basis points in compared to  and  ii mitigating a portion of the impact of declining yields on earning assets on the company s net interest income 
the company s net interest spread  which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was percent in compared to percent in and percent in the net interest spread  as well as the net interest margin  will be impacted by future changes in short term and long term interest rate levels  as well as the impact from the competitive environment 
a discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about interest rate sensitivity included elsewhere in this report 
provision for possible loan losses the provision for possible loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for possible loan losses after net charge offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which  in management s best estimate  is necessary to absorb probable losses within the existing loan portfolio 
the provision for possible loan losses totaled million in compared to million in and million in see the section captioned allowance for possible loan losses elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of the provision for possible loan losses 
part ii continued item continued noninterest income the components of noninterest income were as follows service charges on deposit accounts other charges  commissions and fees net gain on securities transactions other mortgage banking income total total noninterest income for increased thousand  or percent  compared to while total noninterest income for increased million  or percent  compared to growth in noninterest income over the comparable periods was primarily in deposit service charges and mortgage banking fees 
changes in these items and the other components of noninterest income are discussed in more detail below 
service charges on deposit accounts 
service charges on deposit accounts for increased thousand  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily due to a thousand increase in overdraft fees  which were mostly related to consumer accounts 
the increase in overdraft fees was primarily due to the increased volume in consumer and commercial accounts 
service charges on deposits for increased thousand  or percent  compared to primarily from increased overdraft fees on consumer and commercial accounts 
the increase in overdraft fees was primarily due to increased volume in consumer and commercial accounts 
mortgage banking income 
mortgage banking income for increased thousand  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily due to increased mortgage loan activity during that was primarily attributable to the favorable interest rate environment 
much of the increased activity was refinancing which the company anticipates trending downward in future years as most borrowers have already refinanced to historical low rates 
mortgage banking income for increased thousand  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily due to increased mortgage loan activity during that was primarily attributable to the favorable interest rate environment as many borrowers refinanced debt on their homes 
all other noninterest income 
the aggregate of all other noninterest income accounts decreased thousand  or percent  compared to the decrease was primarily due to the decreased gain on the sale of securities as gains realized were thousand compared to thousand during  or a decrease of thousand 
gain on the sale of securities helped position the company s balance sheet to take advantage of anticipated interest rate increases in future years 
part ii continued item continued the aggregate of all other noninterest income accounts increased thousand  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily due to the increased gain on the sale of securities as gains realized were thousand compared to thousand during  or an increase of thousand 
noninterest expense the components of noninterest expense were as follows salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment other total total noninterest expense for increased million  or percent  compared to while total noninterest expense for increased million  or percent  compared to growth in noninterest expense in and was primarily in salaries  employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expense and other noninterest expenses 
these items and the changes in the various components of noninterest expense are discussed in more detail below 
salaries and employee benefits 
salaries and benefits expense for increased million  or percent  compared to the increase is primarily related to increases in headcount  merit increases and increases in commissions paid in connection with increased revenues associated with georgia first mortgage 
salaries and benefits expense for increased million  or percent  compared to the significant increase from was the result of opening new offices with the company s denovo branch expansions and the acquisition of quitman federal in march occupancy and equipment 
net occupancy expense for increased thousand  or percent  compared to the company experienced increased net occupancy and equipment expense for resulting from one additional office opened during and additional leasing of office space in mid the impact of a new office and additional leasing of office space resulted in higher building maintenance  insurance and utilities costs  higher depreciation on building and equipment and higher lease expense 
net occupancy and equipment cost for increased thousand  or percent  compared to primarily due to increased maintenance  utilities cost  depreciation and lease expense associated with two new branches opened during and the acquisition of quitman federal in march all other noninterest expense 
all other noninterest expense for increased thousand  or percent  compared to the increase is primarily due to additional overhead associated with new offices opened 
in addition  legal and professional fees increased thousand  director fees increased thousand  other losses for litigation contingency fund increased thousand and city  county and state business occupation taxes increased thousand  stationery and supplies expense increased thousand and software and license fee expense increased thousand to account for additional increases for compared to part ii continued item continued all other noninterest expense for increased million  or percent  compared to the increase is primarily due to two new branches opened during and the acquisition of quitman federal in march in addition  legal and professional fees increased thousand  atm expense increased thousand  general insurance expense increased thousand  internet banking expense increased thousand  telephone expense increased thousand and intangible amortization increased thousand to account for additional increases for compared to sources and uses of funds the following table illustrates  during the years presented  the mix of the company s funding sources and the assets in which those funds are invested as a percentage of the company s average total assets for the period indicated 
average assets totaled million in compared to million in and million in sources of funds deposits noninterest bearing interest bearing federal funds purchased long term debt and other borrowings other noninterest bearing liabilities equity capital total uses of funds loans securities federal funds sold interest bearing deposits in other banks other interest earning assets other noninterest earning assets total deposits continue to be the company s primary source of funding 
over the comparable periods  the relative mix of deposits continues to be high in interest bearing deposits 
interest bearing deposits totaled percent of total average deposits in compared to percent in and percent in the company primarily invests funds in loans and securities 
loans continue to be the largest component of the company s mix of invested assets 
loan demand continues to be strong as total loans were million at december   up percent  compared to loans of million at december   while total loans at december  were up percent compared to loans of million at december  see additional discussion regarding the company s loan portfolio in the section captioned loans included below 
the majority of funds provided by deposit growth have been invested in loans 
part ii continued item continued loans the following table presents the composition of the company s loan portfolio as of december for the past five years 
in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction mortgage  farmland mortgage  other consumer other unearned discount allowance for loan losses loans the following table presents total loans as of december  according to maturity distribution 
in thousands maturity one year or less after one year through five years after five years overview 
loans totaled million at december   up percent from december  loans of million 
the majority of the company s loan portfolio is comprised of the real estate loans other and installment loans to individuals 
real estate loans other  which is primarily family residential properties and nonfarm nonresidential properties  made up percent and percent of total loans while installment loans to individuals made up percent and percent of total loans at december  and  respectively 
real estate loans other include both commercial and consumer balances 
loan origination risk management 
the company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk 
management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis 
a reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production  loan quality  concentrations of credit  loan delinquencies and nonperforming and potential problem loans 
diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions 
part ii continued item continued commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business 
once it is determined that the borrower s management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen  the company s management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay his her obligations as agreed 
underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking 
most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets  however  some short term loans may be made on an unsecured basis 
commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans  in addition to those of real estate loans 
these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate 
as detailed in the discussion of real estate loans below  the properties securing the company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location 
this diversity helps reduce the company s exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry 
management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral  geography and risk grade criteria 
the company also utilizes third party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas it serves 
from time to time  the company may originate loans to developers and builders that are secured by non owner occupied properties 
in such cases  the company generally requires the borrower to have had an existing relationship with the company and have a proven record of success 
commercial real estate loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies  independent appraisal reviews  sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners 
sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre committed permanent loans from approved long term lenders  sales of developed property or an interim mini perm loan commitment from the company until permanent financing is obtained 
these loans are closely monitored by on site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes  general economic conditions and the availability of long term financing 
the company originates consumer loans utilizing a credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process 
to monitor and manage consumer loan risk  policies and procedures are developed and modified  as needed  jointly by line and staff personnel 
this activity  coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers  minimizes risk 
additionally  trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis 
the company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis 
results of these reviews are presented to management 
the loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel  as well as the company s policies and procedures 
commercial  financial and agricultural 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans at december  decreased percent from december  to million 
the company s commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small  medium and large businesses 
the purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment 
while some short term loans may be made on an unsecured basis  most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with the company s loan policy guidelines 
part ii continued item continued industry concentrations 
as of december  and  there were no concentrations of loans within any single industry in excess of percent of total loans  as segregated by standard industrial classification code sic code 
the sic code is a federally designed standard industrial numbering system used by the company to categorize loans by the borrower s type of business 
collateral concentrations 
lending is concentrated in commercial and real estate loans primarily to local borrowers 
the company has a high concentration of real estate loans  however  these loans are well collateralized and  in management s opinion  do not pose an adverse credit risk 
in addition  the balance of the loan portfolio is sufficiently diversified to avoid significant concentration of credit risk 
although the company has a diversified loan portfolio  a substantial portion of borrower s ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon the viability of the real estate economic sector 
large credit relationships 
the company is currently in fifteen counties in south and central georgia and include metropolitan markets in doughtery  lowndes and houston counties 
as a result  the company originates and maintains large credit relationships with several commercial customers in the ordinary course of business 
the company considers large credit relationships to be those with commitments equal to or in excess of million prior to any portion being sold 
large relationships also include loan participations purchased if the credit relationship with the agent is equal to or in excess of million 
in addition to the company s normal policies and procedures related to the origination of large credits  the company s central credit committee must approve all new and renewed credit facilities which are part of large credit relationships 
the following table provides additional information on the company s large credit relationships outstanding at year end 
number of relationships period end balances number of relationships period end balances committed outstanding committed outstanding large credit relationships million and greater million to million maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the maturity distribution of the company s loans at december  the table also presents the portion of loans that have fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans in accordance with changes in an interest rate index such as the prime rate 
part ii continued item continued due in one year or less after one year through five years after five years total loans with fixed interest rates loans with floating interest rates total the company may renew loans at maturity when requested by a customer whose financial strength appears to support such renewal or when such renewal appears to be in the company s best interest 
in such instances  the company generally requires payment of accrued interest and may adjust the rate of interest  require a principal reduction or modify other terms of the loan at the time of renewal 
nonperforming assets and potential problem loans year end nonperforming assets and accruing past due loans were as follows loans accounted for on nonaccrual loans past due days or more renegotiated loans other real estate foreclosed total nonperforming assets nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed assets total assets accruing past due loans days past due or more days past due total accruing past due loans nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and foreclosed real estate 
nonperforming assets at december  increased percent from december  the significant increase in foreclosed real estate is primarily a residential subdivision and golf course development for approximately million that was reclassified from nonaccrual to other real estate in the third quarter of a contract has been signed with scheduled closing in first quarter that would remove this asset from nonperforming though there is one day extension from march  included in the contract 
part ii continued item continued generally  loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become days past due and or management deems the collectibility of the principal and or interest to be in question  as well as when required by regulatory requirements 
loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for nonaccrual status whether or not the loan is days or more past due 
for consumer loans  collectibility and loss are generally determined before the loan reaches days past due 
accordingly  losses on consumer loans are recorded at the time they are determined 
consumer loans that are days or more past due are generally either in liquidation payment status or bankruptcy awaiting confirmation of a plan 
once interest accruals are discontinued  accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations 
subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal  and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured 
classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest 
renegotiated loans are loans on which  due to deterioration in the borrower s financial condition  the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower or either principal or interest has been forgiven 
foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans 
foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value  less estimated selling costs  at the time of foreclosure 
write downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for possible loan losses 
on an ongoing basis  properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations 
write downs are provided for subsequent declines in value and are included in other noninterest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties 
the after tax impact based on a percent marginal tax rate of lost interest from nonperforming loans was approximately thousand in compared to thousand in and thousand in allowance for possible loan losses the allowance for possible loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for possible loan losses charged to expense  which represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for possible loan losses includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas  and allowance allocations determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits  however  the entire allowance is available for any credit that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the company s control  including the performance of the company s loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
part ii continued item continued allowance for possible loan losses continued the company s allowance for possible loan losses consists of three elements i specific valuation allowances established for probable losses on specific loans  ii historical valuation allowances calculated based on historical loan loss experience for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends  and iii unallocated general valuation allowances determined based on general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors such as peer comparison  industry comparison and regulatory guidelines 
the allowances established for probable losses on specific loans are based on a regular analysis and evaluation of classified loans 
loans are classified based on an internal credit risk grading process that evaluates  among other things i the obligor s ability to repay  ii the underlying collateral  if any  and iii the economic environment and industry in which the borrower operates 
this analysis is performed at the relationship manager level for all commercial loans 
loans with a calculated grade that is below a predetermined grade are adversely classified 
once a loan is classified  a risk management officer analyzes the loan to determine whether the loan is impaired and  if impaired  the need to specifically allocate a portion of the allowance for possible loan losses to the loan 
specific valuation allowances are determined by analyzing the borrower s wherewithal to repay amounts owed  collateral deficiencies  the relative risk grade of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower s industry  among other things 
if after review  a specific valuation allowance is not assigned to the loan  and the loan is not considered to be impaired  the loan is included with a pool of similar loans that is assigned a historical valuation allowance calculated based on historical loss experience 
historical valuation allowances are calculated based on the historical loss experience of specific types of loans and the internal risk grade of such loans at the time they were charged off 
the company calculates historical loss ratios for pools of similar loans with similar characteristics based on the proportion of actual charge offs experienced to the total population of loans in the pool 
the historical loss ratios are periodically updated based on actual charge off experience 
a historical valuation allowance is established for each pool of similar loans based upon the product of the historical loss ratio and the total dollar amount of the loans in the pool 
the company s pools of similar loans include similarly risk graded groups of commercial and industrial loans  commercial real estate loans  consumer loans and family residential mortgages 
unallocated general valuation allowances are based on general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company 
in general  such valuation allowances are determined by evaluating  among other things i the experience  ability and effectiveness of the bank s lending management and staff  ii the effectiveness of the company s loan policies  procedures and internal controls  iii changes in asset quality  iv changes in loan portfolio volume  v the composition and concentrations of credit  vi the impact of competition on loan structuring and pricing  vii the effectiveness of the internal loan review function  viii the impact of environmental risks on portfolio risks  and ix the impact of rising interest rates on portfolio risk 
management evaluates the degree of risk that each one of these components has on the quality of the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis 
peer comparisons  industry comparisons and regulatory guidelines are used to determine an appropriate general valuation allowance 
part ii continued item continued loans identified as losses by management  internal loan review and or bank examiners are charged off 
furthermore  consumer loan accounts are charged off automatically based on regulatory requirements 
an allocation of the reserve for loan losses has been made according to the respective amounts deemed necessary to provide for the possibility of incurred losses within the various loan categories 
the allocation is based primarily on previous charge off experience adjusted for risk characteristic changes among each category 
additional reserve amounts are allocated by evaluating the loss potential of individual loans that management has considered impaired 
the reserve for loan loss allocation is based on subjective judgment and estimates  and therefore is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
the following table shows a five year comparison of the allocation of the reserve for loan losses 
reserve reserve reserve reserve reserve commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate farmland real estate other loans to individuals all other loans total loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total end of period loans 
activity in the allowance for loan losses is presented in the following table 
there were no charge offs or recoveries related to foreign loans during any of the periods presented 
part ii continued item continued the following table presents an analysis of the company s loan loss experience for the periods indicated 
in thousands allowance for loan losses at beginning of year charge offs commercial  financial and agricultural real estate consumer recoveries commercial  financial and agricultural real estate consumer net charge offs provision for loans losses business combination allowance for loan losses at end of year ratio of net charge offs to average loans the allowance for possible loan losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate by management  based on estimated probable losses within the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the provision for possible loan losses reflects loan quality trends  including the level of net charge offs or recoveries  among other factors 
the provision for possible loan losses increased million from million in to million in higher provisions were considered necessary during due to the overall uncertainty in the economy  increased loan volume and deterioration of one large commercial line 
during  the provision for possible loan losses increased million from the million recorded in the provision for possible loan losses was higher in primarily due to the prevailing weak economic conditions and increased loan volume 
part ii continued item continued net charge offs in increased thousand compared to while net charge offs in increased thousand compared to the general increase in net charge offs during the comparable periods is reflective of the more stringent credit standards and the weak economic conditions 
commercial and industrial loan charge offs in were significantly impacted by the deterioration of one large credit 
that one commercial credit accounted for approximately percent of total charge offs for management believes the level of the allowance for possible loan losses was adequate as of december  should any of the factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses change  the company s estimate of probable loan losses could also change  which could affect the level of future provisions for possible loan losses 
investment portfolio the following table presents carrying values of investment securities held by the company as of december   and in thousands us treasuries and government agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions corporate obligations marketable equity securities investment securities mortgage backed securities total investment securities and mortgage backed securities part ii continued item continued investment portfolio continued the following table represents maturities and weighted average yields of investment securities held by the company as of december  within year after year but within years after years but within years after years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield us government agencies mortgage backed securities obligations of states and political subdivisions corporate obligations marketable equity securities total investment portfolio securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
securities are classified as available for sale when they might be sold before maturity 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income 
the company has percent of its portfolio classified as available for sale 
at december   there were no holdings of any one issuer  other than the us government and its agencies  in an amount greater than percent of the company s stockholders equity 
the average yield of the securities portfolio was percent in compared to percent in and percent in the decline in the average yield over the comparable periods primarily resulted from the investment of new funds received from deposit growth at lower current yields and the reinvestment of proceeds from the early repayment of mortgage backed securities in similar investments  also at lower current yields 
the early repayment of mortgage backed securities primarily resulted from borrower refinancing due to lower market interest rates 
the overall growth in the securities portfolio over the comparable periods was primarily funded by deposit growth 
part ii continued item continued deposits the table below presents the daily average balances of deposits by type and weighted average rates paid thereon during the years presented the following table presents the average amount outstanding and the average rate paid on deposits by the company for the years  and in thousands average amount average rate average amount average rate average amount average rate noninterest bearing demand deposits interest bearing demand and savings time deposits total deposits the following table presents the maturities of the company s other time deposits as of december  in thousands other time deposits or greater other time deposits less than total months to maturity or less over through over months average deposits increased million in compared to and million in compared to the increase in included million  or percent  related to noninterest bearing deposits while the increase in included million  or percent related to noninterest bearing deposits 
accordingly  the ratio of average noninterest bearing deposits to total average deposits was percent in from percent in and percent in the general decline in market rates  had the effect of i reducing the average cost of total deposits by basis points in compared to and basis points in compared to  and  ii mitigating a portion of the impact of declining yields on earning assets on the company s net interest income 
part ii continued item continued total average interest bearing deposits increased million  or percent  in compared to and increased million  or percent  in compared to the growth in average deposits in compared to was primarily in money market deposit accounts and savings and interest on checking accounts and other time accounts 
due to the uncertainty of the low interest rate environment  it appears that many customers are less inclined to invest their funds for extended periods and are choosing to maintain such funds in readily accessible money market and interest on checking accounts and short term time accounts 
off balance sheet arrangements  commitments  guarantees  and contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of december  payments for borrowings do not include interest 
payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts 
loan commitments and standby letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts  however  since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or only partially used  the total amounts of these commitments do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements 
payments due by period year or less more than year but less than years years or more but less than years years or more total contractual obligations subordinated debentures other borrowed money federal home loan bank advances operating leases deposits with stated maturity dates other commitments loan commitments standby letters of credit performance letters of credit total contractual obligations and other commitments part ii continued item continued in the ordinary course of business  the banks have entered into off balance sheet financial instruments which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
these instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit  performance letters of credit  guarantees and liability for assets held in trust 
such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the instruments become payable 
the company uses the same credit policies for these off balance sheet financial instruments as they do for instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
loan commitments 
the company enters into contractual commitments to extend credit  normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses  at specified rates and for specific purposes 
substantially all of the company s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding 
the company minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures 
management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for possible loan losses 
loan commitments outstanding at december  are included in the preceeding table 
standby and performance letters of credit 
letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
in the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  the company would be required to fund the commitment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment 
if the commitment is funded  the company would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer 
the company s policies generally require that standby and performance letters of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements 
standby and performance letters of credit outstanding at december  are included in the preceeding table 
capital and liquidity at december   stockholders equity totaled million compared to million at december  in addition to net income of million  other significant changes in stockholders equity during included million of dividends paid and an increase of thousand resulting from the stock grant plan 
the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity totaled thousand at december  compared to thousand at december  this fluctuation was mostly related to the after tax effect of changes in the fair value of securities available for sale 
under regulatory requirements  the unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale does not increase or reduce regulatory capital and is not included in the calculation of risk based capital and leverage ratios 
regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure tier and total capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both on balance sheet and off balance sheet items 
tier capital consists of common stock and qualifying preferred stockholders equity less goodwill 
tier capital consists of certain convertible  subordinated and other qualifying debt and the allowance for loan losses up to percent of risk weighted assets 
the company has no tier capital other than the allowance for loan losses 
part ii continued item continued capital and liquidity continued using the capital requirements presently in effect  the tier ratio as of december  was percent and total tiers and risk based capital was percent 
both of these measures compare favorably with the regulatory minimum of percent for tier and percent for total risk based capital 
the company s tier leverage ratio as of december  was percent  which exceeds the required ratio standard of percent 
for  average capital was million  representing percent of average assets for the year 
this compares to percent for the company paid quarterly dividends of   and per common share during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively  and quarterly dividends of   and per common share during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
this equates to a dividend payout ratio of percent in and percent in liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities 
the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of balance sheet structure  the ability to liquidate assets  and the availability of alternative sources of funds 
the company seeks to ensure its funding needs are met by maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset liability management 
asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits in banks  securities available for sale  maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity  and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 
liability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which include core deposits 
should the need arise  the company also maintains relationships with the federal home loan bank and several correspondent banks that can provide funds on short notice 
since colony is a holding company and does not conduct operations  its primary sources of liquidity are dividends up streamed from subsidiary banks and borrowings from outside sources 
the liquidity position of the company is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate 
management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
in addition  management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity  which if implemented  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
part ii continued item continued impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap presently requires the company to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the company  including changes in the expected rate of inflation  the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities  among other things  as further discussed in the next section 
regulatory and economic policies the company s business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities  among other things 
the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve board are i conducting open market operations in united states government obligations  ii changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings  iii imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits  and iv restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowing by financial institutions and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
for that reason alone  the policies of the federal reserve board have a material effect on the earnings of the company 
governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future  however  the company cannot accurately predict the nature  timing or extent of any effect such policies may have on its future business and earnings

the adjustments are based on a federal tax rate of percent 
taxable equivalent adjustments totaling   and  for  and  respectively  are included in tax exempt interest on investment securities 
the adjustments are based on a federal tax rate of percent with appropriate reductions for the effect of disallowed interest expense incurred in carrying tax exempt obligations 
part ii continued item continued colony bankcorp  inc and subsidiary interest rate sensitivity the following table is an analysis of the company s interest rate sensitivity position at december  the interest bearing rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by repricing period  is based upon maturity or first repricing opportunity  along with a cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap 
it is important to note that the table indicates a position at a specific point in time and may not be reflective of positions at other times during the year or in subsequent periods 
major changes in the gap position can be  and are  made promptly as market outlooks change 
assets and liabilities repricing within in thousands months or less to months year to years over years total earning assets interest bearing deposits federal funds sold investment securities loans  net of unearned income loans held for sale other interest bearing assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits savings time deposits short term borrowings subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of interest earning assets cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of interest earning assets interest bearing demand and savings accounts for repricing purposes are considered to reprice within months or less 
short term borrowings for repricing purposes are considered to reprice within months or less 
part ii continued item continued the foregoing table indicates that we had a one year negative gap of million  or percent of total assets at december  in theory  this would indicate that at december   million more in liabilities than assets would reprice if there were a change in interest rates over the next days 
thus  if interest rates were to decline  the gap would indicate a resulting increase in net interest margin 
however  changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and our supporting liability can vary significantly while the timing of repricing of both the assets and our supporting liability can remain the same  thus impacting net interest income 
this characteristic is referred to as a basis risk and  generally  relates to the repricing characteristics of short term funding sources such as certificates of deposit 
gap analysis has certain limitations 
measuring the volume of repricing or maturing assets and liabilities does not always measure the full impact on the portfolio value of equity or net interest income 
gap analysis does not account for rate caps on products  dynamic changes such as increasing prepay speeds as interest rates decrease  basis risk  or the benefit of nonrate funding sources 
the majority of our loan portfolio reprices quickly and completely following changes in market rates  while nonterm deposit rates in general move slowly and usually incorporate only a fraction of the change in rates 
products categorized as nonrate sensitive  such as our noninterest bearing demand deposits  in the gap analysis behave like long term fixed rate funding sources 
both of these factors tend to make our actual behavior more asset sensitive that is indicated in the gap analysis 
in fact  we experience higher net interest income when rates rise  opposite what is indicated by the gap analysis 
in fact  during the recent period of declines in interest rates  our net interest margin has declined 
therefore  management uses gap analysis  net interest margin analysis and market value of portfolio equity as our primary interest rate risk management tools 
return on assets and stockholders equity the following table presents selected financial ratios for each of the periods indicated 
year ended december  return on assets return on equity dividend payout equity to assets part ii continued item continued future outlook colony is an emerging company in an industry filled with nonregulated competitors and a rapid pace of consolidation 
the year brings with it new opportunities for growth in our existing markets  as well as opportunities to expand into new markets through acquisitions and denovo branching 
colony completed the acquisition of quitman federal during and with the quitman acquisition opened a branch in the valdosta lowndes county market during the first quarter of the company anticipates purchasing real estate for a second location in lowndes county that would open during the company purchased real estate in the lee dougherty counties market during and is constructing its third office with an anticipated opening in early additionally  real estate was purchased in the thomas county market for a future office  probably in other areas of interest in south and central georgia include glynn  ware and chatham counties  with annual retail sales greater than million and a population greater than  in addition  the company signed a definitive agreement to purchase flag thomaston office with scheduled closing on march  the office  with current deposits of approximately million  will allow colony to compete in upson county and muscogee county georgia
