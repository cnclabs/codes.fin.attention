overview we are a financial services holding company that  through our subsidiaries  provides investment advisory  insurance  financial planning and related services 
we operate in a highly regulated and competitive industry  that is influenced by numerous external factors such as economic conditions  marketplace liquidity and volatility  monetary policy  global and national political events  regulatory developments  competition and investor preferences 
our revenues and net earnings may be either enhanced or diminished from period to period by any one of or by a multiple of these external factors 
in addition  the passage of the graham leach bliley act in november of repealed depression era laws that separated commercial  investment banking and insurance activities 
such repeal may result in the intensification of the environment in which we compete by increasing the number of companies doing business in the financial services arena 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
these critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the company 
valuation of securities and other assets substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  these include cash  cash equivalents  and securities purchased under agreements to resell  deposits with clearing organizations  securities owned  and securities sold but not yet purchased 
in accordance with fas  certain financial instruments are classified as trading and available for sale 
the realized gains and losses are recorded in the income statement in the period in which the transactions occurred 
the unrealized gains and losses related are reflected in other comprehensive income depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument 
where available  the company uses prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer price quotations 
fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
in addition  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for instance  the company generally assumes that the size of positions in securities that the company holds would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if the company were to sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value 
off balance sheet risk the company is engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose counterparties primarily include the general public 
in the event counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  the company may be exposed to risk 
securities sold  but not yet purchased  represent obligations of the company to purchase the security in the market at the prevailing prices to the extent that the company does not already have the securities in possession 
accordingly  these transactions result in off balance sheet risk when the company s satisfaction of the obligations exceeds the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty of issuer of the instrument 
it is the company s policy to review  as necessary  the credit standings of each counterparty with which it conducts business 
commissions receivables from one source were and of total receivables for the years ended march  and  respectively 
receivable from and payable to brokers and clearing organizations the balances shown as receivable from and payable to brokers and clearing organizations represent amounts due in connection with the company s normal transactions involving trading of securities 
management considers all receivables to be collectible  therefore no allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided 
reserves the company records reserves related to legal proceedings in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an employee of the company  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law 
each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge credit to earnings in that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual disposition of a legal proceeding could be greater or less than the reserve amount
