overview of the business juniper networks  inc juniper networks or we was founded in to develop and sell products that would be able to meet the stringent demands of service providers 
today  we are a leading provider of network infrastructure solutions that transform the business of networking 
our products enable customers to improve their business models by providing more differentiation and value to end users as well as increased reliability and security  thereby making the network a more valuable asset 
we sell and market our products through our direct sales organization and value added resellers 
overview of the results of operations 
table of contents to aid in understanding our operating results for the years ended december   and  we believe an overview of the significant events that occurred during those years and a discussion of the nature of the expenses is helpful 
significant events as a result of an economic slowdown beginning in and going into  many telecommunication service providers cut back capital expenditure and discretionary spending budgets 
these cut backs contributed to the decrease in our revenues beginning in late and through to help combat the financial impact of the reduction in revenue  we undertook a series of initiatives 
the first initiative was a restructuring in to better align our operations with the then current market and service provider industry conditions 
this restructuring initiative included a worldwide workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities and restructuring of certain business functions 
in july  we completed our acquisition of unisphere networks  inc unisphere  a subsidiary of siemens corporation  which is a subsidiary of siemens ag siemens 
unisphere developed  manufactured and sold data networking equipment optimized for applications at the edge of service provider networks 
the acquisition enabled us to expand our customer base and add a complementary product to our existing product line without any need to reorganize or modify our existing organizational or cost structure 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations  we have included in our results of operations for the results of unisphere from july  the unisphere acquisition impacted revenue  cost of revenues and all operating expenses for the second half of the results for include a full year of results of the combined companies 
in connection with the acquisition of unisphere  we initiated plans to eliminate certain duplicative activities  focus on strategic product and customer bases  reduce cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions 
in  we announced that we were no longer developing our g series cmts products and recorded a one time charge that was comprised of workforce reduction costs  non inventory asset impairment  the costs associated with vacating facilities and terminating contracts and other related costs 
we expect this action to facilitate the focus on core competencies and reduce cost structure 
during the second calendar quarter of  we issued million of zero coupon convertible senior notes due june  also during  we paid million to retire a portion of the convertible subordinated notes due march  these transactions had an effect on our cash  cash equivalents  investments  interest income and interest expense 
nature of expenses most of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain management operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers  accordingly  most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers 
the independent contract manufacturers manufacture our products using quality assurance programs and standards that we establish 
controls around manufacturing  engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale  california and westford  massachusetts 
our independent contract manufacturers have facilities in neenah  wisconsin and toronto  canada 
generally  our contract manufacturers retain title to the underlying components and finished goods inventory until our customers take title to the assembled final product upon shipment from the contract manufacturer s facility 
we realized savings in carrying and obsolete material charges from to and through the contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is significantly lower than our forecasts  
table of contents we may be  and have been in the past  liable for carrying or obsolete material charges 
during  there was a large expense related to carrying and obsolete material due to the change in the global economy and the sudden decrease in product revenues 
during the first half of  the global economy continued to have an adverse effect on our revenues  however  it began to improve during the second half 
in addition  as part of the unisphere acquisition  we consolidated our outsourced contract manufacturing operations from three to two  and incurred additional carrying and obsolete material charges 
carrying and obsolete charges decreased during as the global economy and our product revenue continued to improve 
the primary component of our operating expenses historically has been employee related costs  which includes items such as wages  commissions  bonuses  vacation  benefits and travel 
in addition  the facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount 
following are descriptions of the unique expense items in each operating expense class 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses include the costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products  outside services for such services as certifications of new products  equipment used for testing and patent related costs 
several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures  such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment  the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services  demonstration equipment and advertisements 
these costs can vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues  product launches and marketing initiatives 
in addition to employee related expenses  general and administrative expenses include professional fees  bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses 
professional fees include legal  audit  tax  accounting and corporate strategic services 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these policies include revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which impacts general and administrative expenses  the valuation of exposures associated with the contract manufacturing operations and estimating future warranty costs  both of which impact cost of product revenues and gross margins  and the provision of income taxes  which would impact our income tax expense 
we have other important accounting policies and practices 
however  once adopted  these other policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy and not a judgment as to the policy itself 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and also on assumptions that we believe are standard and reasonable 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when persuasive 
table of contents evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured  unless we have future obligations for such things as network interoperability or customer acceptance  in which case revenue and related costs are deferred until those obligations are met 
in most cases  we recognize product revenue upon shipment to our customers  including resellers  as it is our policy to ensure an end user has been identified prior to shipment 
service revenue is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the service period 
beginning july   we recognized revenue on arrangements where products and services were bundled in accordance with eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in applying the concepts of eitf  we must determine whether the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting 
we allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual deliverables either based on their relative fair values or using the residual method  as circumstances dictate 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition 
the application of eitf includes judgments whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and whether we have established objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than the fair values 
in addition  our ability to recognize revenue in the future will be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers and by our assessment of collectibility 
we assess the probability of collection by reviewing our customers payment history  financial condition and credit report 
if the probability of collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until the payment is collected 
the amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is also impacted by our judgments made in establishing our reserve for potential future product returns 
although our arrangements do not include any contractual rights of return  and our general policy is that we do not accept returns  under unique circumstances we have and may in the future accept product returns from our customers 
therefore  we do provide a reserve for our estimate of future returns against revenue in the period the revenue is recorded 
our estimate of future returns is based on such factors as historical return data and current economic condition of our customer base 
in addition  we get input from our sales and support organizations on potential product returns relating to specific customer issues 
the amount of revenue we recognize will be directly impacted by our estimates made to establish the reserve for potential future product returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than previously seen 
we also consider our historical level of credit losses 
our reserves historically have been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
if actual credit losses were to be significantly greater than the reserves we have established  our general and administrative expenses would increase 
conversely  if actual credit losses were to be significantly less than our reserves  our general and administrative expenses would decrease 
contract manufacturer exposures we outsource most of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers 
accordingly  a significant portion of the cost of revenues consists of payments to them 
our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture products based on our build forecasts 
these forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products 
these estimates are based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations  adjusted for overall market conditions 
if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast  we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers  such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures  that would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
demand for our products and component usage are largely affected by factors that are outside of our control 
warranty reserves we generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products as well as a day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products 
the warranty generally includes parts  labor and hour service center support 
on occasion  the specific terms and conditions of those 
table of contents warranties vary 
we record a liability based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations and charge to cost of product sales the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim 
our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim are primarily based on historical information and future forecasts 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
if actual warranty claims are significantly higher than forecast  or if the actual costs incurred to provide the warranty is greater than the forecast  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
provision for income taxes estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under sfas  accounting for income taxes  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable 
accordingly  a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets has been established to reflect uncertainty regarding future realization of these assets  in part  due to the potential impact of future stock option deductions 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed  a further charge to expense would result 
results of operations net revenues the following table shows product and service net revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  net revenues product service total net revenues our net revenues for each of the last three years have primarily changed as a result of the changes in the global economy  which caused fluctuations in our customers capital expenditure budgets 
beginning in mid  the overall global economy deteriorated and most of our customers reduced their capital expenditure budgets 
we began to see these factors improve in  as was evidenced by the change in chassis revenue units and ports shipped  as summarized in the table below 
chassis revenue units ports shipped our platforms are essentially modular  with the chassis serving as the base of the platform 
each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces 
the modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media 
the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port 
the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module 

table of contents chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period 
chassis revenue units and ports shipped are tracked to analyze customer trends and are used as indicators for potential network growth 
the increase in product net revenues in compared to was due primarily to an increase in the demand for our products resulting from our customers expanding their networks for new applications and users  partially offset by a shift in product mix to less expensive products 
we did not experience any unusual pricing pressure in compared to the decrease in product net revenues in compared to was due primarily to a decrease in the demand for our products that resulted from the generally unfavorable economic conditions throughout and a shift in product mix to less expensive products 
service net revenues increased each of the last two years as a result of a larger installed base of customers and products 
a majority of service revenue is from customers who previously purchased our products and enter into a service contract 
in addition to service contracts  service revenue is generated from providing professional and educational services 
service contracts are typically for one year renewable periods and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period 
two customers individually accounted for and of total net revenues in for  one customer accounted for of net product revenues  compared to  where one customer accounted for  a second customer accounted for and a third customer accounted for of net product revenues 
management began including service revenue in its calculation of significant customers in the second half of the following table shows net revenue by geographic region in thousands year ended december  americas europe  middle east and africa asia pacific total we experienced a shift in net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues from the americas region to europe and asia during the last two years as the capital spending market in the united states declined at a greater rate than the international market 
we expect the split among the americas and international regions to remain relatively consistent during cost of revenues the following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin gm percentages for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  gm gm gm cost of revenues product service total cost of revenues the increase in product gross margins from to was primarily due to savings in outsourced manufacturing costs as a result of improved efficiencies and cost cutting initiatives at our contract manufacturers 
the increase in product gross margins was also due to a decrease in carrying and obsolete material charges from to in addition  included a one time charge of million related to the unisphere acquisition for backlog orders and an inventory write up adjustment 

table of contents product gross margins were flat at for and as a result of operational costs being cut as the demand for our products decreased 
the decrease in absolute dollars for cost of product revenue from to was directly related to the decrease in product revenue  which was primarily a result of unfavorable economic conditions many customers experienced throughout  as well as to a decrease in carrying and obsolete material charges 
service gross margins increased from to as a result of the increase in service revenue as compared to only a increase in cost of service revenues 
we were able to grow service revenue at a faster rate than cost of service revenues due to improved efficiencies and economies of scale that were a direct result of a larger install base  and thus a more leveraged service organization 
this increased leverage is evidenced by the fact that total employee related expenses decreased as a percentage of service revenue from for to for  however  in absolute dollars employee related expenses increased slightly 
in addition  in absolute dollars  the costs associated with spare parts increased by year over year 
service gross margins increased from to primarily due to a larger installed base of customers and products combined with realized savings in our service organization for personnel and other related costs associated with our restructuring activities 
research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the following table shows research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  research and development sales and marketing general and administrative research and development expenses increased million in compared to  but decreased as a percent of total net revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to a increase in employee related expenses as a result of a full year of operations after the acquisition of unisphere 
in addition  we stopped paying bonuses in as part of our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives  however  we started to accrue employee bonuses in the second half of as our financial results improved 
offsetting the increase in employee related expenses was a decrease in consulting and contractor services due to our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives and a decrease in prototype expenses 
prototype expenses are closely tied to product launches because of the testing and certification needed before a product can be offered to the public  and the amounts can vary depending on the product being developed 
research and development expenses increased million and as a percent of total net revenues in compared to the increases were primarily a result of a increase in headcount related expenses  a increase in the use of consulting and contractor services  partially offset by savings in prototype equipment 
headcount related expenses and consulting and contractor services increased primarily due to the unisphere acquisition 
prototype equipment expenses were higher during because we were preparing for the release of our high end t series products  as well as certain m series and j series products  and developing and testing a new family of application specific integrated circuits asics 
we expect to continue to devote resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
we believe that research and development is critical to our strategic product development objectives and that to leverage our leading technology and meet the changing requirements of our customers  we will need to fund investments in several development projects in parallel 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses increased million in compared to  but decreased as a percent of total net revenues 
the majority of the increase in absolute dollars was a increase in employee related expenses in the sales organization as a result of additional headcount and commissions  resulting from the increase in revenue 
in addition  customer facing expenses such as marketing events and customer programs increased 
offsetting the increases was a decrease of for demonstration equipment  which is expensed immediately and is closely tied to product launches 
to date  we have not incurred significant advertising expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million in compared to  but increased as a percent of net revenues 
the decrease in absolute dollars was a result of a decrease in costs related to employee and partner events  a reduction in the use of demonstration equipment  and consolidation of excess facilities  all of which are attributable to our cost cutting initiatives 
we intend to continue to focus and expand our sales and marketing efforts across all the geographies and markets we serve in order to increase market awareness of our products and to better support our existing customers worldwide 
we believe that continued investment in sales and marketing is critical to our success 
general and administrative expenses decreased million and as a percent of total net revenues in compared to the majority of the decrease was due to a reduction in bad debt expense in compared to this reduction was a result of greater than expected collection efforts and the absence of any significant customer bankruptcies 
the decrease in bad debt expense was partially offset by a increase in professional services related to certain strategic consulting activities 
general and administrative expenses decreased million in compared to  but increased as a percent of total net revenues 
the decrease was due to a savings in employee related expenses and a decrease in the use of outside services  both of which are attributable to our cost cutting initiatives 
other operating expenses the following table shows other operating expenses in absolute dollars for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  restructuring and other amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation in process research and development integration amortization of goodwill restructuring and other in the third quarter of  we announced that we are no longer developing our g series cmts products and recorded a one time charge of approximately million that was comprised of workforce reduction costs  non inventory asset impairment  vacating facilities costs  the costs associated with termination of contracts and other related costs 
our board of directors approved the restructuring charge and expects that the plan will facilitate the focus on core competencies and reduce our cost structure 
the following table shows the breakdown of the restructuring charge and the liability remaining as of december  in thousands remaining liability as of non cash cash december  initial charge charges payments workforce reduction asset impairment facilities 
table of contents remaining liability as of non cash cash december  initial charge charges payments other contractual commitments and other charges total the workforce reduction related primarily to the termination of employees that were mainly located in the americas and europe regions 
we expect to pay the remaining balance of the severance accrual by the end of the first quarter of non inventory asset impairment was primarily for long lived assets that were no longer needed as a result of our decision to cease further development of the product line 
facility charges consist primarily of the cost of vacating facilities that were dedicated to the development of the g series cmts products and the impairment cost of certain leasehold improvements 
the net present value of the facility charge was calculated using our risk adjusted borrowing rate 
amounts related to the net facility charge will be paid over the respective lease term through july the difference between the actual future rent payments and the net present value will be recorded as operating expenses when incurred 
other contractual commitments and other charges consist primarily of million of carrying and obsolete material charges from our contract manufacturers and suppliers for on hand and on order material related to the g series cmts products and million of costs to satisfy end of life commitments in certain customer contracts 
all of these costs were included as a charge to the results of operations in the quarter ended september  changes to the estimates of executing the currently approved plans of restructuring will be reflected in results of operations 
during the third quarter of  in connection with the acquisition of unisphere  we recorded restructuring expenses of approximately million  associated primarily with workforce related costs  costs of vacating duplicative facilities  contract termination costs  non inventory asset impairment charges and other associated costs  net of a million adjustment due to a change in estimate 
as of december   there was million remaining to be paid  entirely related to facility costs to be paid through april we also recognized a charge of approximately million during the quarter ended september  related to the land acquired in january located in sunnyvale  california 
the charge was primarily for costs of exiting certain contractual obligations associated with the land 
we currently have no plans to continue developing the land in the foreseeable future 
in june  we announced a restructuring program that included a worldwide workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities and restructuring of certain business functions 
as of december   there was million remaining to be paid  entirely related to facility costs to be paid through august amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation we amortize purchased intangible assets and deferred stock compensation over their estimated lives 
the following table shows the breakdown of the amortization expenses in thousands year ended december  amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation the amortization expense of intangible assets increased million in compared to due to the intangible assets purchased in the unisphere acquisition in july the amortization expense of intangible assets increased million in compared to due to the intangible assets purchased in the unisphere acquisition in july and a full year of amortization of the intangible assets purchased in the pacific broadband communications pacific broadband acquisition in december the amortization expense of deferred stock compensation was million in  which included a credit  as required by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issue to employees  apb of approximately million due to employees who forfeited options for which compensation expense had been recognized on the 
table of contents graded vesting method  but which were unvested on the date their employment was terminated 
a majority of these employees were a part of the restructuring plan in the amortization expense of deferred stock compensation was million and million in and  respectively 
the primary reason for the decrease was a reversal  as required by apb  of million in previously recognized stock compensation expense 
this reversal related to the difference between the expense that had been previously recognized under the graded vesting method for former employees and the expense that would have been recorded using the straight line method 
finally  the decrease in expense is also a result of using the graded vesting method  which expenses a larger percent in the earlier months 
in process research and development in july  we completed the acquisition of unisphere  a subsidiary of siemens 
following the acquisition and during the remainder of  siemens was one of our significant resellers 
the acquisition resulted in the payment of million cash and the issuance of million shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately million to the former stockholders of unisphere 
we recorded goodwill of million  purchased intangible assets of million  in process research and development ipr d of million and deferred compensation on unvested stock options of million 
the intangibles assets  other than goodwill  are being amortized over their respective useful lives  which we determined to be between two and six years 
in december  we acquired pacific broadband and accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated million of the million purchase price as in process research and development 
we also originally recorded goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million 
the intangibles assets have been completely amortized as of december  integration we incurred integration expenses of approximately million in the quarter ended september  resulting from our acquisition of unisphere 
integration expenses are one time incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies that have no go forward benefit 
the integration expenses consisted principally of workforce related expenses for individuals transitioning their positions and professional fees 
amortization of goodwill there was no amortization of goodwill in and in accordance with sfas amortization of goodwill was million in from the micro magic  inc acquisition  which occurred in other income and expenses the following table shows other income and expenses for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  interest and other income interest and other expense gain loss on retirement of convertible subordinated notes  net gain on sale of investments write down of investments equity in net loss of joint venture interest and other income decreased million in compared to the decrease was the result of lower cash and investment balances throughout as we spent million to retire a portion of our convertible subordinated notes due march  the subordinated notes  
table of contents partially offset by the million in net proceeds received from the issuance of the zero coupon convertible senior notes due june  the senior notes 
in addition  interest rates were lower in as compared to interest and other income decreased million in compared to the decrease was the result of lower cash and investment balances throughout as we spent million to retire a portion of the subordinated notes and million in the unisphere acquisition 
in addition  interest rates were lower in as compared to interest and other expenses decreased million in compared to and million in compared to  almost entirely due to interest saved from the partial retirement of the subordinated notes during each of the last two years 
during  we paid million to retire and redeem a portion of the subordinated notes 
these subordinated notes had a cost basis of million 
the retirement resulted in a gain of million and the redemption resulted in a loss of million  both of which was the difference between the carrying value of the subordinated notes at the time of their retirement  including unamortized debt issuance costs  and the amount paid to extinguish such notes 
in the quarter ended september   we paid approximately million to retire a portion of the subordinated notes 
this partial retirement resulted in a gain of approximately million  which was the difference between the carrying value of the subordinated notes at the time of their retirement  including unamortized debt issuance costs  and the amount paid to extinguish such notes 
during the first and second quarters of  we sold some of our marketable equity securities classified as available for sale  which had a cost basis of million  and recognized gains of million 
we have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost  adjusted for any impairment  as we own less than of the voting equity and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies 
we wrote down these investments million and million in and  respectively  for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary 
there were no such write downs in equity in net loss of joint venture decreased million in compared with during the quarter ended june   we entered into a joint venture agreement with ericsson ab  through our respective subsidiaries  to develop and market products for the wireless internet infrastructure market 
in addition to this joint venture  ericsson is also one of our significant resellers  representing greater than of our revenues in  and as of december   we had no further obligations to fund this joint venture 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased to million in from million in the effective rate was and reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions  the benefit of research credits and capital loss carryforwards and the inability to benefit certain charges and losses 
provision for income taxes decreased to million in from million in the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively

the irs is currently auditing the company s federal income tax returns for fiscal years and proposed adjustments have not been received for these years 
management believes the ultimate outcome of the irs audits will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview we have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities 
the following table shows our capital resources in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments restricted cash working capital working capital decreased from to primarily due to the partial retirement of the subordinated notes  offset by cash provided by operations and the issuance of common stock through employee stock option exercises and stock purchase plans 
the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable  reduced by accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next months 
in addition  there are no transactions  arrangements  and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources 
cash requirements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than more than total year years years years operating leases  net of committed subleases convertible subordinated notes due march  subordinated notes interest due on the subordinated notes zero coupon convertible senior notes due june  total contractual principal cash obligations as of december   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases  the subordinated notes and the senior notes 
the contractual obligations under operating leases are primarily for our facilities 
interest is paid semi annually on march and september for the subordinated notes at an annual rate of 
anytime we retire a portion of the subordinated notes  the interest accrued on that portion is due 
the senior notes were issued in june and are senior unsecured obligations  rank on parity in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt  and rank senior to all of our existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes  including our subordinated notes 
the senior notes bear no interest  but are convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to certain conditions  at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by juniper networks 
the conversion rate is shares per each  principal amount of convertible notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 

table of contents we do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers 
in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply  the contract manufacturers place non cancelable  non returnable ncnr orders based on our build forecasts 
as of december   there were ncnr orders valued at million 
we do not take ownership of the components and the ncnr orders do not represent firm purchase commitments per our agreements with the contract manufacturers 
the components are used to build products based on purchase orders we have received from our customers 
the liability for products built by the contract manufacturer is recorded once they fulfill our customer s order and the order ships 
if the components go unused  there may be carrying charges or obsolete charges assessed 
as of december   we had accrued million for potential exposures with our contract manufacturers  such as carrying and obsolete material charges 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the cash provided by operating activities for all periods was due to our net income in and net losses in and adjusted by ongoing non cash charges such as depreciation expense  amortization expenses for intangible assets  deferred compensation and debt costs  and normal fluctuations in accounts receivable  prepaid and other current assets  long term assets  accounts payables  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue

recurring investing activities included capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
we reduced our capital expenditures over the past two years as part of our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives 
we have also made investments in securities classified as available for sale and sold investments to fund ongoing operations  the partial retirement of the subordinated notes and the unisphere acquisition 
we have also made minority equity investments of million  million and million  respectively  in privately held companies 
unusual investing activities include i an increase of million in restricted cash for the establishment of a trust to secure our indemnification obligations to certain directors and officers and the purchase of letters of credit to secure certain facility leases and ii million paid in related to the unisphere acquisition 

table of contents financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  we received proceeds during all three years from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans 
we also received million in net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes in and paid million and million in and  respectively  to retire a portion of the subordinated notes 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r 
fin r clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties  including the equity holders 
fin r requires the consolidation of these entities  known as variable interest entities vies  by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the entity  if any  that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
among other changes  the revisions of fin r a clarified some requirements of the original fin  which had been issued in january  b eased some implementation problems  and c added new scope exceptions 
fin r deferred the effective date of the interpretation for public companies to the end of the first reporting period ending after march   except that all public companies must at a minimum apply the unmodified provisions of the interpretation to entities that were previously considered special purpose entities in practice and under the fasb literature prior to the issuance of fin r by the end of the first reporting period ending after december  among the scope exceptions  companies are not required to apply fin r to an entity that meets the criteria to be considered a business as defined in the interpretation unless one or more of four named conditions exist 
fin r applies immediately to a vie created or acquired after january  we do not have any interests in vies 
factors that may affect future results we face intense competition that could reduce our market share and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues 
competition in the network infrastructure market is intense 
this market has historically been dominated by cisco with other companies such as nortel networks and alcatel providing products to a smaller segment of the market 
in addition  a number of other small public or private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our products address 
if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors from a product offering standpoint or from potential price competition by such competitors  we could experience a loss in market share and or be required to reduce prices  resulting in reduced gross margins  either of which could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
the fluctuating economic conditions  combined with the financial condition of some of our customers  make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues may harm our operating results 
the recent economic downturn generally  and in the telecommunication industry specifically  combined with our own relatively limited operating history in the context of such a downturn  makes it difficult to accurately forecast revenue 

table of contents we have experienced and expect  in the foreseeable future  to continue to experience limited visibility into our customers spending plans and capital budgets 
this limited visibility complicates the revenue forecasting process 
additionally  many customers funded their network infrastructure purchases through a variety of debt and similar instruments and many of these same customers are carrying a significant debt burden and are experiencing reduced cash flow with which to carry the cost of the debt and the corresponding interest charges  which reduces their ability to both justify and make future purchases 
the telecommunications industry has experienced consolidation and rationalization of its participants and we expect this trend to continue 
there have been adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt markets for telecommunications industry participants  which have affected their ability to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures 
in some cases the significant debt burden carried by these customers has reduced their ability to pay for the purchases made to date 
this has contributed  and we expect it to continue to contribute  to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of capital expenditures  further limiting visibility and complicating the forecasting process 
certain of these customers have filed for bankruptcy as a result of their debt burdens 
although these customers generally expect that they will emerge from the bankruptcy proceedings in the future  a bankruptcy proceeding can be a slow and cumbersome process  further limiting the visibility and complicating the revenue forecasting process as to these customers 
even if they should emerge from such proceedings  the extent and timing of any future purchases of equipment is uncertain 
this uncertainty will further complicate the revenue forecasting process 
in addition  our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are  and will continue to be  fixed in the short term 
if we do not achieve our expected revenues  the operating results will be below our expectations and those of investors and market analysts  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
a limited numbers of customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect on us 
even though our customer base has increased substantially  we expect that a large portion of our net revenues will continue to depend on sales to a limited number of customers 
during  ericsson and siemens each accounted for greater than of net revenues 
ericsson was the only customer that accounted for greater than of net revenues during any downturn in the business of these customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers that could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations 
we rely on distribution partners to sell our products  and disruptions to these channels could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 
we believe that our future success is dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of distribution partners 
we have entered into agreements with several value added resellers  some of which also sell products that compete with our products 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain or attract resellers on a timely basis or at all  or that the resellers will devote adequate resources to selling our products 
any acquisition we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition if we are not able to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or if expected benefits of the combination do not materialize 
we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and investments in order to enhance our business 
for example  we recently entered into an agreement to acquire netscreen technologies  inc in a stock for stock acquisition valued at approximately billion at signing 
this transaction  if consummated  will dilute our existing stockholders percentage ownership 
in addition  some of our results will be negatively impacted due to certain purchase accounting rules which will result in a write down of netscreen s deferred revenue and other purchase accounting adjustments 
further  the failure to effectively manage the acquisition and integration of netscreen could disrupt our business and harm our financial results 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire 

table of contents the integration of businesses that we have acquired into our business has been and will continue to be a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
failure to operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication system  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices could adversely impact the success of any business combination 
for example  although we completed the acquisition of unisphere networks on july   integration of the products  product roadmap and operations is a continuing activity and will be for the foreseeable future 
as a result of these activities  we may lose opportunities and employees  which could disrupt our business and harm our financial results 
we also intend to make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
in the event of any such investments or acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur amortization expenses related to purchases of intangible assets  or incur large and immediate write offs 
our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected software or hardware errors  our business could be adversely impacted 
our products are highly technical and are designed to be deployed in very large and complex networks 
certain of our products can only be fully tested when deployed in networks that generate high amounts of ip traffic 
as a result  we may experience errors in connection with such products and for new products and enhancements 
any defects or errors in our products discovered in the future could result in loss of or delay in revenue  loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost  any of which could adversely impact our business and our results of operations 
if our products do not interoperate with our customers networks  installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 
our products are designed to interface with our customers existing networks  each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors 
many of our customers networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved 
our products must interoperate with all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers requirements 
if we find errors in the existing software used in our customers networks  we must modify our software to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware 
if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers networks  installations could be delayed  orders for our products could be cancelled or our products could be returned 
this would also damage our reputation  which could seriously harm our business and prospects 
traditional telecommunications companies generally require more onerous terms and conditions of their vendors 
as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business 
traditional telecommunications companies because of their size generally have had greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received more favorable terms  which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors 
as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer  we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that effect our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
in addition  many of this class of customer have purchased products from other vendors who promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such functionality and or had products that caused problems and outages in the networks of these customers 
as a result  this class of customer may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products 
these 
table of contents additional requests and penalties  if we are required to agree to them  may affect our ability to recognize the revenue from such sales  which may negatively affect our business and our financial condition 
if we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs  or if those products do not gain market acceptance  we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or that we will be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate the market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements to meet those needs  such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales of our present and future products  which would significantly harm our business and financial results 
even if we are able to anticipate and develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements  there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance 
any failure of our future products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect our business and financial results 
our ability to develop  market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 
our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering  sales  marketing and support personnel 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers  could delay the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to develop  market  sell  or support our products 
if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements  we could incur additional costs which would harm our results of operations or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 
our contract manufacturers are not obligated to supply products for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order because we do not have long term supply contracts with them 
in addition  lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for each component at a given time 
we provide to our contract manufacturers a demand forecast 
if we overestimate our requirements  the contract manufacturers may assess charges that could negatively impact our gross margins 
for example  for the quarter ended september   we recorded a charge for approximately million associated with contractual liabilities and carrying charges on excess material at our contract manufacturers 
if we underestimate our requirements  the contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenues 
we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components  which make us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations 
with the current demand for electronic products  component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited 
we currently purchase several key components  including asics  from single or limited sources 
for example  ibm is our asic supplier 
we may not be able to develop an alternate or second source in a timely manner  which could hurt our ability to deliver product to customers 
if we are unable to buy these components on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver product to our customers  which would seriously impact present and future sales  which would  in turn  adversely affect our business 

table of contents we currently depend on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have long term supply contracts  and changes to those relationships  expected or unexpected  may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships 
we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of whom is a third party manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products 
we do not have a long term supply contract with such manufacturers and if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays  disruptions or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations  our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights may be time consuming and require a significant amount of resources to prosecute or defend  therefore we may have to expend a substantial amount of resources to make our products non infringing and may have to pay a substantial amount of money in damages 
third parties have and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us 
for example  in  toshiba corporation filed suit against us  alleging that our products infringe certain toshiba patents 
the asserted claims and or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers  suppliers  or customers  alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our products 
regardless of the merit of these claims  they can be time consuming  result in costly litigation  require us to develop non infringing technologies or enter into license agreements 
furthermore  because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable  even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant funds 
if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful  or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we are a party to lawsuits  which  if determined adversely to us  could require us to pay damages which could harm our business and financial condition 
we and certain of our former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits 
there can be no assurance that actions that have been or will be brought against us will be resolved in our favor 
regardless of whether they are in our favor  these lawsuits are  and any future lawsuits to which we may become a party in the future will likely be  expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve 
any losses resulting from these claims could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow 
the long sales and implementation cycles for our products  as well as our expectation that customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a customer s decision to purchase our products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process 
as a result  the sales cycle may be lengthy 
throughout the sales cycle  we often spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
even after making the decision to purchase  customers tend to deploy the products slowly and deliberately 
timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer  the size of the network deployment  the complexity of the customer s network environment and the degree of hardware and software configuration necessary to deploy the products 
customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis 
accordingly  we expect to receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis 
these long cycles  as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times  may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 

table of contents our products incorporate and rely upon licensed third party technology and if licenses of third party technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive  our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 
we integrate licensed third party technology in certain of our products 
from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements 
third party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
our inability to maintain or re license any third party licenses required in our current products or our inability to obtain third party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements  could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost  any of which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to the global nature of our operations  economic or social conditions or changes in a particular country or region could adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses  which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our resellers in countries outside of the united states and also depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers that are located outside of the united states 
for the years ended december  and  we derived approximately and of our revenues  respectively  from sales outside north america 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including  among others  political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries  service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations  and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue  costs  expenses and financial condition 
if our restructuring initiatives are not sufficient to meet industry and market conditions and to achieve future profitability  we may undertake further restructuring initiatives  which may adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in response to industry and market conditions  we have restructured our business and reduced our workforce 
the assumptions underlying our restructuring efforts will be assessed on an ongoing basis and may prove to be inaccurate and we may have to restructure our business again in the future to achieve certain cost savings and to strategically realign our resources 
while restructuring  we have assessed  and will continue to assess  whether we should further reduce our workforce and facilities  as well as review the recoverability of our tangible and intangible assets  including the land purchased in january any such decisions may result in the recording of additional charges  such as workforce reduction costs  facilities reduction costs  asset write downs  and contractual settlements 
additionally  estimates and assumptions used in asset valuations are subject to uncertainties  as are accounting estimates with respect to the useful life and ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  future market conditions may result in further charges for the write down of tangible and intangible assets 
we may not be able to successfully implement the initiatives we have undertaken in restructuring our business and  even if successfully implemented  these initiatives may not be sufficient to meet the changes in industry and market conditions and to achieve future profitability 
furthermore  our workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 
lastly  costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may be higher than the estimated costs of such actions and or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results and cash flows 

table of contents because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states  we face exposure to adverse movements in non us currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 
the majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in us dollars 
we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the japanese yen  hong kong dollar  british pound and the euro  related to our sale and service operations outside of the united states 
an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in us dollars  and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 
currently  we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 
our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and  as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenues  operating results  book to bill ratio and other financial indicators will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
the factors that may impact the unpredictability of our quarterly results include the reduced visibility into customers spending plans  the changing market conditions  which have resulted in some customer and potential customer bankruptcies  a change in the mix of our products sold  from higher priced core products to lower priced edge products  and long sales and implementation cycle 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of operating results are not a good indication of future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarters  operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in which case the price of our common stock may fall 
if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively impacted 
our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future 
if we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes  our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted 
we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if those networks and ip infrastructure do not continue to grow then our business  operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth of ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services 
as a result of changes in the economy and capital spending  which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers  spending on ip infrastructure can vary 
a significant reduction in such spending would adversely affect our business 

table of contents regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects 
the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by the changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications industry 
currently  there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on data networks 
we could be adversely affected by regulation of those networks and commerce occurring on them in any country where we operate 
such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using internet protocol  encryption technology  and access charges for service providers 
the adoption of such regulations could decrease demand for our products  and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands valuation of securities given an interest fair value valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points bps as of rate increase of x bps december issuer bps bps bps  bps bps bps government treasury and agencies corporate bonds and notes asset backed securities and other total these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps  which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 
the majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in us dollars 
however  since we have sales and service operations outside of the us  we do have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  japanese yen  hong kong dollar  british pound and the australian dollar 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen  british pound and australian dollar 
these derivatives are not designated as hedges under sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at december  
table of contents  the notional and fair values of these contracts were insignificant 
we do not expect gains and losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our financial results 
we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses  denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen  british pound and australian dollar 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas at december   the notional and fair values of these contracts were insignificant 
we do not expect gains and losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our financial results 
these contracts have original maturities ranging from one to three months 
we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign contracts with credit worthy financial institutions
