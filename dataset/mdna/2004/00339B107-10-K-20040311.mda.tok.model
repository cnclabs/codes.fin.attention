item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
when used in this annual report on form k  the words intend  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan and expect and similar expressions as they relate to abgenix are included to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth below and under additional factors that might affect future results set forth in item of part i of this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand our company 
our business we are a biopharmaceutical company that is focused on the discovery  development and manufacture of human therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of a variety of diseases 
we intend to use our proprietary technologies to build a large and diversified product portfolio that we expect to develop and commercialize largely through joint development and commercialization arrangements with pharmaceutical companies and others 
we are co developing our most advanced proprietary product candidate  abx egf  with immunex 
abx egf is in pivotal trials  and we have two product candidates in early stage clinical trials 
in addition  we have entered into a variety of contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical  biotechnology and genomics companies involving our technologies 
we use our closely integrated process sciences and manufacturing capabilities for the manufacture of our own proprietary product candidates and also offer these services to our collaborators and others 
we intend to enter into co development agreements  in addition to our agreement for abx egf 
we generally expect to self fund preclinical and clinical activities to determine preliminary safety and efficacy before entering into joint development and commercialization agreements 
in some cases we may conduct product development entirely on our own 
we have begun to implement our collaboration strategy through co development arrangements with companies such as chugai  u and dendreon  and through a broad collaboration in oncology with astrazeneca 
our strategy is designed to diversify the risks associated with our research and development spending  and to continue to focus our activities on product development and commercialization 
under our collaboration with astrazeneca  we are obligated to provide preclinical and clinical research support for the development of up to product candidates by astrazeneca  and have an opportunity to co develop products with astrazeneca 
our financial position and liquidity we derive our revenues from our technology out licensing contracts  our proprietary product development agreements  our target sourcing contracts and our production services contracts 
we expect that substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future will result from payments under these and similar arrangements and that payments we receive under these arrangements will continue to be subject to significant fluctuation in both timing and amount 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with our product development activities  both under contractual arrangements with third parties and related to our independent research and development efforts 
regulatory and business factors will require us to expend substantial funds in the course of completing required additional development  preclinical testing and clinical trials of  and attaining regulatory approvals for  product candidates 
the amounts of the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties that may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
we have incurred net losses since we were organized as an independent company  including a net loss of million in we expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future as a result of our research and development costs and manufacturing start up costs  including costs associated with conducting preclinical development and clinical trials  and charges related to purchases of technology or other assets 
we expect that the amount of our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
the amounts of the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties that may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources to a significant extent 
we plan to continue to make significant expenditures to establish  staff and operate our own manufacturing facility and support our research and development activities  including preclinical product development and clinical trials 
we expect that these activities will substantially increase our operating expenses over the next few years in comparison to prior periods 
results of operations years ended december   and contract revenues contract revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
because they depend to a large extent on the success or failure of research and development efforts undertaken by our collaborators and licensees  our year to year contract revenues can fluctuate significantly and are inherently difficult to predict 
the primary components of contract revenues for all periods were as follows technology licensing we recognized a total of million  million and million in  and  respectively  from licensing our proprietary technologies 
revenues consisted primarily of the following chugai pharmaceutical co 
ltd 
in  we recognized million under an agreement with chugai in which we exclusively licensed to chugai rights under patent applications and patents held by us related to methods of treatment of certain diseases with an antibody 
celltech r d ltd 
in each of and  we recognized million under an agreement with celltech in which we granted a license of our slam technology 
we received payments totaling million in the fourth quarter of representing a research license fee and service fees for the transfer of technology  net of million in shared closing costs 
we recognized these fees over the six month period ended march   during which we fulfilled our obligations to provide celltech with the applicable protocols  technical information  and training to enable celltech to effectively utilize the slam technology 
additionally  in  and we recognized various fees  such as research license and service fees  product license fees  product development and research milestone payments  and option fees  under agreements related to the licensing of our xenomouse technology 
these revenues were generated from several collaborators  but were primarily from pfizer  amgen and curagen 
proprietary product development we recognized a total of million  million and million in  and  respectively  pursuant to our joint development and commercialization agreements for the development of abx egf and abx cbl 
in  and  these revenues included reimbursement of development costs 
in  these revenues also included milestone and license fees 
the license fees were recognized ratably over the contractual performance periods 
under the abx egf agreement  this was the month period ended december  under the abx cbl agreement  this was the month period ended january  revenue decreased in as compared to primarily due to a decrease in reimbursement of development costs as our collaborator s cost exceeded our cost for the development of abx egf 
in addition  we and sangstat discontinued the development of the abx cbl program  which resulted in the reduction of development costs related to reimbursements 
revenue decreased in as compared to because in the revenue included milestone and license fees 
production services we recognized a total of million in for production services 
in and we did not recognize any revenues from our production services 
in  these revenues consisted primarily of process sciences services and were generated from our manufacturing contract with curagen 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in and increased from million in the major components of research and development expenses for  and were as follows research and development december  in thousands product development    research    in licensing   total research and development costs    product development costs include costs of preclinical development  cell line development and conducting clinical trials 
additionally  product development includes costs related to cell line development activities we perform under our production services contracts 
the primary components of product development include the costs of abgenix personnel  drug supply costs  research fees charged by outside contractors  co development costs  and facility expenses including depreciation 
in  our product development costs decreased in comparison to costs for abx egf increased significantly in  however  offsetting this increase were decreases that were primarily related to discontinuing the development of abx il and abx cbl  as well as decreases in costs for abx ma  abx pth and other pipeline product candidates 
product development costs can vary from period to period significantly depending on the progress of the development cycle 
overall  we expect costs associated with product development in to be higher than as we and our co developer immunex initiate new trials and add patients to our existing abx egf clinical trials 
in  our product development costs increased primarily due to activities related to abx egf  abx pth and other product candidates such as an antibody to the complement protein properdin 
these increases were offset partially by decreases in costs of developing abx il and abx cbl 
research costs include costs associated with research  and testing of antibodies we generate  whether for ourselves or for our customers  prior to the development stage  which begins with the commencement of preclinical activities 
research costs also include the costs of research relating to proprietary technologies  including enhancements to those technologies 
the primary components of research costs include the costs of abgenix personnel  facilities  including depreciation  and lab supplies 
beginning in october of  we implemented a restructuring of our operations and reduced many of our research and testing activities including those related to new target validation 
as a result  our research costs decreased in as compared to the increase in research costs in as compared to was due to an increase in the level of research activities  including activities related to new target validation and bioinformatics and an increase in the number of targets being tested  including those under our collaborations 
in licensing costs include costs to acquire licenses to develop and commercialize various technologies and molecules 
the largest component of this cost in and was related to licenses and research funding for the development of therapeutic antibodies to the complement protein properdin  which we licensed from gliatech inc in  we decided to discontinue the development of properdin and as a result we recorded an impairment charge of million for previously capitalized costs and  of other related costs related to the license to develop and commercialize properdin 
overall  we expect in licensing costs in to decrease compared to due to a reduction in costs associated with the properdin license 
major components of research and development costs for and were as follows costs of abgenix personnel costs of abgenix personnel to support research and development activities decreased in from and increased in from the decrease in was a result of our restructuring plan implemented in october  which resulted in an approximately reduction in total employees overall 
we were able to support a reduced workforce in due to discontinuing the development of abx il and abx cbl and because our co developer has taken over responsibility for many new development activities for the development of abx egf 
personnel costs primarily include salary  fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs 
the increase in compared to was due to increased personnel costs for process sciences and preclinical research 
consulting and outside contractors costs of consulting and outside contractors to support research and development activities decreased in as compared to and increased in as compared to the decrease in was primarily due to a reduction of activities performed by outside contractors related to the development of cell lines for our product candidates 
in  the increase was primarily associated with the activities related to the development of abx pth and the development of an antibody to the complement protein properdin 
clinical research fees clinical research fees including clinical investigator site fees  monitoring costs  and data management costs decreased in as compared to and in as compared to the decrease in both years was primarily due to the decrease in clinical trials being conducted for abx il and abx cbl 
in  the decrease was partially offset by the increased clinical trial activities for abx egf 
drug supply costs drug supply costs decreased in compared to and increased by in as compared to the decrease in was primarily due to discontinuing the clinical trials related to abx il and abx cbl 
in  as a result of our decision to wind down our clinical trials of abx il  we recorded a charge of million relating to clinical trial supplies that we had previously capitalized 
also  included drug supply costs for abx ma and abx pth 
co development costs co development costs  which primarily consist of reimbursement to immunex for our share of abx egf development costs  increased in compared to and in as compared to the increases in both years were primarily related to co development cost sharing associated with the development of abx egf performed by immunex 
in  the increase was also due to the increased activities for clinical trials and the further development of abx egf 
the clinical trial status of product candidates included in product development costs is as follows as of december for each of the years indicated clinical trial status as of proprietary product candidate indication abx egf panitumumab various cancers phase phase phase renal cell cancer phase phase phase non small cell lung cancer phase phase phase colorectal cancer phase phase phase colorectal cancer with chemotherapy phase phase phase prostate cancer phase phase phase colorectal cancer outside the us pivotal colorectal cancer pivotal abx ma metastatic melanoma phase phase phase abx pth secondary hyperparathyroidism phase abx il chronic obstructive pulmonary disease phase phase psoriasis phase metastatic melanoma phase abx cbl graft versus host disease phase phase clinical trial managed by immunex 
we have discontinued development of this product candidate 
manufacturing start up costs manufacturing start costs were million in we began manufacturing antibody therapeutic candidates in portions of our manufacturing facility in the second quarter of  at which time we began to depreciate the portions of the facility that were placed into service 
manufacturing start up costs include certain costs associated with our new manufacturing facility  including depreciation  outside contractor costs and personnel costs for activities such as quality assurance and quality control 
the primary component of this cost in was a cancellation fee of approximately million expensed in june for the negotiated cancellation of an agreement with an outside contractor  lonza 
effective june   we canceled our november agreement with lonza for the exclusive use of a cell culture production suite because we determined that with the opening of our own manufacturing facility we no longer needed access to the lonza facility 
we expect the facility to be under utilized in and therefore manufacturing start up costs will continue in however  we expect manufacturing start up costs to decrease in compared to as a result of expensing the lonza cancellation fee in and the utilization of the facility in for the manufacture of abx egf and potentially other product candidates under production services agreements 
goodwill and amortization of identified intangible assets our identified intangible assets consist primarily of existing technology including patents and certain royalty rights we acquired through the acquisitions of hesed biomed in  abgenix biopharma and intraimmune in  and jt america s interest in xenotech in amortization of intangible assets totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
beginning january   upon our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill 
instead  we will perform impairment tests annually  or earlier if indications of impairment exist 
we conducted an initial test for impairment of our goodwill in and an annual impairment test in and  and concluded that no impairment charge was required 
the amortization of goodwill was million in all other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the decrease in amortization in from was a result of ceasing to amortize goodwill  partially offset by the full year s amortization of the new technology acquired in the hesed biomed acquisition 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include compensation  professional services  consulting and other expenses related to information systems  legal  finance  and an allocation of facility costs 
general and administrative expenses totaled million in  million in and million in the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in consulting services related to the implementation of our new information systems in and in legal costs due to the timing of activities related to securities filings  financing activities  licensing and other contractual matters  partially offset by a charge of million in due to the sublease of one of our facilities for less than our obligation under the lease 
the primary reason for the increase in as compared to  was the increase in consulting and personnel expenses related to our information systems  including the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system 
another significant reason for the increase was the depreciation expense related to the enterprise resource planning system  which was placed into service at the beginning of the third quarter of restructuring charges in october  we announced a restructuring plan  which consisted primarily of a reduction in employees 
a restructuring charge of million was recorded in to account for severance  medical and other benefits associated with this restructuring 
of the million  million was paid in and the remainder in interest and other income interest and other income consist primarily of interest from cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest and other income totaled million in  million in and million in the decreases were due to lower interest rates and lower average investment balances 
interest expense interest expense was related to interest and amortization of issuance costs on our convertible subordinated notes due  and interest on our equipment leaseline financing and loan facility 
interest expense increased to million in from million in and  in the interest expense increase in and was primarily due to the million of convertible notes we issued in march  which accrues interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually 
interest expense in the amount of million and million related to the convertible debt was capitalized in and  respectively 
capitalized interest decreased in the third and fourth quarters of because we placed into service a portion of our manufacturing facility in for each future annual period  we expect to pay and record expense of approximately million of interest related to our convertible debt until the debt matures  until we redeem or repurchase the debt or until all or part of the debt is converted into shares of our common stock 
impairment of investments in  we invested million in equity securities of mds proteomics  a privately held company  in connection with our collaboration with that company 
as of december  and june   we determined that an impairment of our investment had occurred and estimated that the value of our investment had declined to zero and million  respectively 
accordingly  we recorded impairment charges of and million  respectively  in the fourth quarter of and second quarter of the amount of the charge was based on the difference between the estimated value as determined by our management and our revised or original cost basis 
at december   the investment was recorded in long term investments on the balance sheet 
we purchased an aggregate amount of million of common stock of curagen and immunogen as strategic investments at various times in and in  declines in the fair value of the curagen and immunogen common stock were deemed to be other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded a total impairment charge of million for the year ended december  as of december   these investments were recorded at fair value in long term investments on the balance sheet  and the net unrealized holding gain of million is included as a component of stockholders equity 
if we deem these investments further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur an additional impairment charge on these investments 
foreign income tax expense foreign income tax expense was recorded reflecting an income tax provision on foreign contract research projects of approximately  in the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
we invest our cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily in highly liquid  interest bearing  investment grade and government securities in order to preserve principal 
we have also invested in certain marketable equity securities of immunogen and curagen for strategic reasons 
these securities had a fair value of million at december  cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
this reflects a decrease of million in and an increase of million in the major components of the changes in cash used in operating activities were primarily the following a decrease of million and an increase of million in and  respectively  in funding of research and development costs  net of depreciation and an impairment charge related to an identified intangible asset 
an increase of million in in manufacturing costs  net of the lonza contract cancellation fee of million and depreciation 
a payment of approximately million on the lonza cancellation obligation in september a decrease of million in and an increase of million in in general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in consulting services related to the implementation of our new information systems in and in legal costs due to the timing of activities related to securities filings  financing activities  licensing and other contractual matters  partially offset by a charge of million due to the sublease of one of our facilities for less than our obligation under the lease 
the increase in as compared to was primarily related to the increase in consulting and personnel expenses related to our information systems  including the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system 
an increase of million and a decrease of million in and  respectively  in customer payments 
both the increase in and the decrease in were affected by the timing of payments received under our contracts 
a decrease of million and million in and  respectively  in cash from interest income  primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average cash balances 
an increase of million and million in and  respectively  in vendor and other payments  which reduced the combined total of accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
a decrease of million and million in and  respectively  in the changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily related to the decrease in the carrying value of clinical trial suppliers 
cash provided by used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in cash was provided by and used in investing activities primarily as follows capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the investments in and reflect primarily investment in construction in progress and equipment for our new manufacturing facility 
the investments in as well as primarily in reflect investment in leasehold improvements in our new office facility and process science laboratory and investments in computer hardware and software  including the acquisition of a new enterprise resource planning system 
over the next year  we estimate that we will spend approximately million on leasehold improvements  equipment  computer hardware and software for our new manufacturing facility and our research and development facilities 
purchases  net of maturities and sales  of marketable securities of million in and maturities and sales  net of purchases  of marketable securities of million and million in and  respectively 
payments of million and million in and  respectively  on account of liabilities related to acquisitions 
in  the amount was primarily related to payments to the holders of abgenix biopharma special shares 
in  the amount included million to the holders of abgenix biopharma special shares and million for the buy out of certain stock options issued in connection with our acquisition of abgenix biopharma in november investments of million and million in and  respectively  as the initial and final disbursements under a loan agreement entered into in august investment of million in equity securities of mds proteomics inc in cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  cash provided by financing activities included million net proceeds from our issuance of series a and a redeemable convertible preferred stock  as described below 
in  cash provided by financing activities included of million net proceeds from our issuance of convertible subordinated notes  as described below 
in  and we received proceeds of million  million and million  respectively from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in october  in connection with a collaboration agreement  we entered into a securities purchase agreement with astrazeneca 
pursuant to the agreement  we issued to astrazeneca million of series a and million of series a convertible preferred stock which mature and years  respectively  from the date of issuance 
the net proceeds from the securities were million 
due to the redemption feature  we do not record the redeemable convertible preferred stock in stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet 
pursuant to its terms  the series a preferred stock was redeemed at the option of astrazeneca in february and we issued astrazeneca a convertible subordinated note with a principal amount of million  which matures on october  no interest is payable on the note except in the event of a payment default by us 
subject to various terms and conditions  if a certain milestone event is reached  we will have the option to issue to astrazeneca up to million of series a preferred stock and if a further milestone event is reached  we will have the option to issue to astrazeneca up to million of series a preferred stock 
each of the series a preferred stock and the series a preferred stock will have a maturity date that is five years from issuance 
subject to certain conditions  we can convert each series of preferred stock and can convert the convertible subordinated note into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of a the average market price for the days prior to the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date provided that the average market price shall in no event be higher than of the market price on the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date or b per share 
astrazeneca may convert each series of preferred stock and the convertible subordinated note into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share  at any time prior to the earlier of a the redemption date or b the maturity date  as applicable 
we must redeem all outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock  if any  at a cash redemption price per share equal to the liquidation preference by october   the mandatory redemption date 
the note matures on october   if still outstanding 
in addition  we can  upon at least days notice to the holder  redeem the shares of series a preferred stock and the convertible subordinated note for cash in an amount equal to its liquidation preference or face amount  as the case may be  at any time prior to maturity of the instrument 
in addition to the mandatory redemption and maturity dates of these securities  certain events can give rise to an earlier redemption 
in certain circumstances  we have certain rights to convert the securities into common stock instead of redeeming the securities for cash 
see note to the financial statements for a full description of the conversion  redemption  and liquidation rights 
in march  we issued million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in a private placement 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share subject to certain adjustments 
the notes accrue interest at an annual rate of and we are obligated to pay interest on march and september of each year 
the notes will mature on march  and are redeemable at our option on or after march   or earlier if the price of our common stock exceeds specified levels 
in addition  the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes if we undergo a change in control 
proceeds from the sale of the notes  net of commissions payable to the initial purchasers of the notes but before subtracting other offering expenses payable by us  were million 
in march and february  we obtained stand by letters of credit for million and million  respectively  from a commercial bank as security for our obligations under two facility leases 
these were increased in january to and million  respectively  in connection with amendments to our facility leases 
in december  the million stand by letter of credit increased to million 
the outstanding stand by letters of credit are secured by an investment account  in which we must maintain a balance of approximately million 
financing uncertainties related to our business plan 
we plan to continue to make significant expenditures to establish  staff and operate our own manufacturing facility and support our research and development activities  including preclinical product development and clinical trials 
we also intend to look for opportunities to acquire new technology through in licensing  collaborations or acquisitions 
over the next year  we estimate that we will spend approximately million on leasehold improvements  equipment  computer hardware and software for our new manufacturing and our research and development facilities 
additionally  we may spend additional amounts to support new production services contracts 
we currently intend to use our available cash on hand to finance these projects and business developments  but we might also pursue other financing alternatives  such as equity or equity related financing  a bank line of credit  sale lease back financing  funding by one or more collaborators or a mortgage financing  that may become available to us 
whether we use cash on hand or choose to obtain financing will depend on  among other things  the future success of our business  the prevailing interest rate environment and the condition of financial markets generally 
the amounts of the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties that may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources to a significant extent 
as of december   three of our proprietary product candidates  abx egf  abx ma and abx pth were in various stages of clinical trials 
the clinical trials of abx egf  abx ma and abx pth are expected to require significant expenditures in the foreseeable future 
in october  we entered into an amendment of our joint development and commercialization agreement with immunex for the co development of abx egf 
under the agreement  immunex is obligated to make available up to million in advances that we may use to fund a portion of our share of development and commercialization costs after we have contributed million toward development costs in completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years however  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trials  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
we test our potential product candidates in numerous preclinical studies to identify disease indications for which they may be product candidates 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials on our own or with our collaborators to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or for one or more indications for a given product candidate in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or indications 
for example  in january and may  we announced that clinical trials of our proprietary product candidate abx il as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis  respectively  did not support further clinical studies of that product candidate 
additionally in february  we announced that the clinical trial of our proprietary product candidate abx cbl as a treatment for graft versus host disease  did not support further clinical studies of that product candidate 
an important element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a diverse range of product candidates for a variety of disease indications 
we may enter co development agreements  similar to our agreement with immunex for abx egf  and may enter into additional joint development agreements earlier in the development life cycle of product candidates than we did in our existing co development agreements 
we have begun to implement our collaboration strategy through co development arrangements with companies such as chugai  u and dendreon 
our strategy is designed to diversify the risks associated with our research and development spending 
the decisions to terminate or wind down our clinical programs for developing abx il and abx cbl have reduced the diversity of our product portfolio 
we believe that this effect is temporary in view of the number and diversity of potential product candidates we have in preclinical development 
for example  we recently advanced abx pth from the preclinical stage into a clinical study in patients with secondary hyperparathyrodism 
to the extent  however  that we are unable to maintain a diverse and broad range of product candidates  our success would depend to a greater extent on the success of one or a few product candidates 
our proprietary product candidates also have not yet achieved fda regulatory approval  which is required before we can market them as therapeutic products 
in order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy 
the number  size and type of clinical trials we conduct for a particular product candidate are also affected by the policies of the fda and european regulatory agencies regarding the availability of possible expedited approval procedures  which we may seek to utilize 
these policies may change from time to time 
as we conduct clinical trials for a given product candidate  we may decide or the fda may require us to make changes in our plans and protocols 
such changes may relate to  for example  changes in the standard of care for a particular disease indication  comparability of efficacy and toxicity of materials where a change in materials is proposed  or competitive developments foreclosing the availability of expedited approval procedures 
we may be required to support proposed changes with additional preclinical or clinical testing  which could delay the expected time line for concluding clinical trials 
in addition  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
a number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our business strategy includes the option of entering into arrangements with third parties to collaborate in the development and commercialization of our products 
in the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one of our product candidates  the estimated completion date would largely be under the control of that third party rather than us 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products or indications  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  in whole or in part  or the extent to which third parties may control clinical trials pursuant to such arrangements  and how such arrangements would affect our capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
we also may be required to make further substantial expenditures if unforeseen difficulties arise in other parts of our business 
in particular  our future liquidity and capital requirements also will depend on many factors other than our research and development activities  including the scope and results of preclinical development and clinical trials  the retention of existing and establishment of further co development  licensing  manufacturing and other agreements  if any  continued scientific progress in our research and development programs  the size and complexity of these programs  the cost of establishing our manufacturing capabilities and complying with good manufacturing practice regulations  the cost of conducting commercialization activities and arrangements  the time and expense involved in seeking regulatory approvals  competing technological and market developments  the time and expense of filing and prosecuting patent applications  and enforcing and defending against patent claims  our investment in  or acquisition of  other companies  the amount of product or technology in licensing in which we engage  and other factors not within our control 
we believe that our current cash balances  cash equivalents  marketable securities  and the cash generated from our licensing and other agreements will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least one year 
however  because of the uncertainties in our business discussed above  among others  we cannot assure you that this will be the case 
in addition  we may choose to  or prevailing business conditions may require us to  obtain additional financing from time to time 
we may choose to raise additional funds through public or private financing  licensing and other agreements or other arrangements 
we cannot be sure that any additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity or equity related financing may be dilutive to our stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may subject us to restrictive covenants 
we may also choose to obtain funding through collaborations  licensing and other contractual arrangements 
such agreements may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
history of net losses 
we have incurred net losses since our organization as an independent company  including in the last five years net losses of million in  million in  million in  million in and million in as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
our losses to date have resulted principally from research and development costs relating to the development of our xenomouse and xenomax technologies and antibody therapeutic product candidates  general and administrative costs relating to our operations  impairment charges relating to our strategic investments in curagen  immunogen and mds proteomics  and manufacturing start up costs relating to our new manufacturing facility including depreciation  outside contractor costs and personnel costs for activities such as quality assurance and quality control 
we expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future as a result of our research and development costs  including costs associated with conducting preclinical development and clinical trials  which will continue to be substantial  charges related to purchases of technology or other assets  and costs associated with establishing and operating our manufacturing facilities 
we intend to invest significantly in our products prior to entering into licensing agreements 
this will increase our need for capital and will result in losses for at least the next several years 
we expect that the amount of operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of increases or decreases in our research and development efforts  the execution or termination of licensing and other agreements  and the initiation  and success or failure  of clinical trials 
net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
our net operating loss carryforwards exclude losses incurred prior to our formation in july further  we have capitalized the amounts associated with the settlement and cross license we have expensed for financial statement accounting purposes and we are amortizing those amounts over a period of approximately years for tax purposes 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire in the years through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
critical accounting estimates the application of several accounting estimates that require us to make subjective and complex judgments impacts the financial results that we report 
we are required to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
changes in our estimates or judgments could materially impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
we believe our most critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition  accounting for our equity investments  accounting for goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes 
revenue recognition we derive our contract revenue from license  option  service and milestone fees received from customers 
services include those performed under our technology out licensing  co development and production services agreements 
as described below  within the framework of generally accepted accounting principles  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and applied in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue in any period 
abgenix enters into revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in order to meet its customer s needs 
for example  the arrangements may include a combination of up front fees  license payments  research and development services  milestone payments  future royalties  and manufacturing arrangements 
multiple element revenue agreements entered into on or after july  are evaluated under emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  to determine whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria in eitf must be treated as one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
generally  the revenue recognition guidance applicable to the final deliverable is followed for the combined unit of accounting 
for certain arrangements  the period of time over which certain deliverables will be provided is not contractually defined 
accordingly  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
accounting for equity investments we record gains and losses on marketable equity investments in accordance with sfas no 
gains and losses that are deemed other than temporary are charged to earnings  and any net unrealized holding gains and losses  to the extent not recognized as an impairment charge  are reported as a component of stockholders equity 
in  declines in the fair value of our investment in curagen and immunogen common stock were deemed to be other than temporary  primarily because the stock of each company traded below our respective cost basis for more than six months 
accordingly  we recorded a total impairment charge for the year ended december  of million 
as of december   these securities had a fair value of million 
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in  we no longer amortize goodwill but instead review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or sooner if indications of impairment exist 
under our accounting policy  we have adopted the beginning of the fourth quarter as an annual goodwill impairment test date 
following this approach  we compare the carrying values available as of september with the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to assess if there has been a potential impairment  and  if impairment is indicated  complete the measurement of impairment under the procedures established by sfas because we have determined that we have one reporting unit under sfas no 
 our market capitalization is considered to be a reasonable proxy for the fair value of the reporting unit 
we also consider whether current business and general market conditions suggest that the fair value of the reporting unit has likely declined below its carrying value 
for a brief period during the first quarter of  our common stock had traded at a price that represented a market capitalization less than our book value 
however this condition did not persist for long and since march   our common stock has traded at a price that represents a market capitalization higher than our book value 
our market capitalization at december  was billion based on the december  stock price of per share 
accordingly  no impairment has occurred 
if we were to determine in a future period that an impairment of goodwill existed  the impairment measurement procedures could result in a charge for the impairment of goodwill 
furthermore  a change in our determination of reporting units could result in a charge for the impairment of goodwill in future periods 
a change in the determination of reporting units could occur should we reorganize into reporting units such that each unit constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management to evaluate the performance of that unit 
as of december   the carrying value of our goodwill was million 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets intangible assets held and used  must be tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include a significant change in the manner in which an asset is being used  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  including and adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a current expectation that  more likely that not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
during  the company decided to discontinue the development of therapeutic antibodies to the complement protein properdin 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to the license to develop and commercialize antibodies to properdin 
the impairment charge was included in research and development expenses on the company s statement of operations 
as of december   we have determined that no changes in circumstances have occurred that would indicate that an additional impairment of an intangible asset had occurred 
if we were to determine in a future period that an impairment of intangible assets have occurred  the impairment measurement procedures could result in a charge for the impairment of long lived assets 
as of december  the carrying value of our intangible assets was million 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the calculation of tax liabilities  the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
results of operations in each jurisdiction involve intercompany agreements between our canadian subsidiary and us parent 
such agreements could be unfavorably interpreted by the applicable taxing authorities  causing an increase in the income tax provision and an increase in our net loss 
the assessment of the income tax implications of this intercompany relationship requires significant management judgment 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   future minimum payments for certain contractual obligations for years subsequent to december  were as follows total less than year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations operating leases      convertible debt interest     redeemable convertible preferred stock  lonza   purchase orders   total      amounts represent total of minimum payments for the entire period 
million of our redeemable convertible preferred stock was redeemed in february in exchange for our issuance of a convertible subordinated note 
in march  we issued million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in a private placement 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share subject to certain adjustments 
the notes accrue interest at an annual rate of 
we are obligated to pay interest on march and september of each year  beginning on september  we expect to make interest payments on the notes of million per year  for years through  and million in  assuming all the notes remain outstanding until their maturity date 
the notes will mature on march  and are redeemable at our option on or after march   or earlier if the price of our common stock exceeds specified levels 
in addition  the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes if we undergo a change in control 
therefore  in march  or earlier if we undergo a change in control  we may use a significant portion of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to repay the million principal amount of our convertible debt 
if our balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at any time is insufficient to meet our obligations under the notes  we would have to seek additional financing  if available  to support our obligations under the notes 
we have issued to astrazeneca as of february   in connection with a collaboration agreement  million of series a convertible preferred stock and a convertible subordinated note with a principal amount of million 
the total net proceeds were million 
the company  subject to certain conditions  can convert the series a convertible preferred stock and can convert the convertible note into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of a the average market price for the days prior to the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date provided that the average market price shall in no event be higher than of the market price on the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date or b per share 
astrazeneca may convert the series a convertible preferred stock and the convertible note into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share  at any time prior to the earlier of a the redemption date or b the maturity date  as applicable 
the company must redeem all outstanding shares  if any  at a cash redemption price per share equal to the liquidation preference by october   the mandatory redemption date 
the note matures on october   if still outstanding 
in addition  we can  upon at least days notice to the holder  redeem the series a convertible preferred stock for cash in an amount equal to its liquidation preference and pre pay the convertible note for its face amount  at any time prior to maturity 
in addition to the mandatory redemption and maturity dates of these securities  certain events can give rise to an earlier redemption 
in such circumstances  we have certain rights to convert the securities into common stock instead of redeeming the securities for cash 
see note to the financial statements for a full description of the conversion  redemption  and liquidation rights 
effective june   we canceled our agreement with lonza for the exclusive use of a cell culture production suite 
upon canceling the agreement  we became obligated to pay lonza four equal installments of  british pounds on october   february   may  and august   which eliminated our commitment to pay approximately million in total monthly fees through august the value of this obligation on the effective date of june  was approximately million 
in september and january  we made the first and second of four installment payments to lonza 
the balance of the obligation as of december  was approximately million 
we have outstanding purchase orders totaling million to contractors related to the purchase of equipment and design and construction of our new manufacturing facility 
other significant commercial commitments include the following a commitment to share equally all development and commercialization costs for abx egf pursuant to our development and commercialization agreement with immunex 
as amended in october  that agreement provides that immunex will have decision making authority for development and commercialization activities and will make available to us million in advances that we may use to fund our share of development and commercialization costs for abx egf after we have contributed million toward development costs in the amount of any such advances  plus interest  may be repaid out of profits resulting from future product sales and we are not obligated to repay any portion of the loan if abx egf does not reach commercialization 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
the interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
we will implement the interpretation in the quarter ending march  we have performed a preliminary analysis of the interpretation and do not believe that the adoption will result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during the quarter ending march   we will complete the evaluation of the implications of the interpretation with respect to all variable interest entities with which we have involvement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate sensitivity on our investments in debt securities and our outstanding fixed rate debt 
the objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid  investment grade and government debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and our goal is to maintain an average maturity of approximately one year 
in addition  as of december   we had million of outstanding convertible subordinated notes due in the fair value of these convertible subordinated notes may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates  as well as changes in the market price of our common stock 
a hypothetical per annum decrease in interest rates would result in an adverse net change in the fair value of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
equity price risk 
we are exposed to equity price risk on strategic investments  such as those we have made in curagen and immunogen 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
with respect to curagen and immunogen  each of whose common stock is publicly traded  the aggregate market value of our investments in these securities was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
due to decreases in the market prices of the shares of curagen and immunogen  we recorded impairment charges of million in related to these investments 
the trading prices of shares of curagen and immunogen have fluctuated significantly since we purchased these securities 
each additional decrease in market value of these securities would result in a decrease in value of approximately million and million from the fair value of those investments at december  and  respectively 
additional price declines could cause us to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
foreign currency risk 
a substantial majority of our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the british pound 
as of december   we had a contract cancellation obligation to lonza of approximately million  which is payable in british pounds 
a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates would result in an increase in the us dollar value of this obligation of approximately million at december
