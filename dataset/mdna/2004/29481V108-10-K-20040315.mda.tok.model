item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement for forward looking information the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the following includes a number of forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  expect  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties such as competitive factors  technology development  market demand and our ability to obtain new contracts and accurately estimate net revenues due to variability in size  scope and duration of projects  and internal issues of the sponsoring client 
such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or future predictions 
further information on potential factors that could affect our financial results can be found in this item under the caption risks related to our business 
overview we provide technology and services that enable the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries to collect  interpret and distribute cardiac safety and clinical data more efficiently 
we are a market leader in providing centralized electrocardiographic services cardiac safety services or expert eecg services and a leading provider of technology and services that streamline the clinical trials process by enabling our clients to evolve from traditional  paper based methods to electronic processing that leverages the power of the internet using our clinical data management products and services 
we were founded in to provide cardiac safety services used to evaluate the safety of new drugs 
in february  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock 
in october  we acquired the assets and business of a provider of clinical data management technology and consulting services to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industry 
in the second half of  we closed our international clinical research organization cro operation  including clinical trial and data management services  and in december we sold our domestic cro operation to scp communications  inc our solutions improve the accuracy  timeliness and efficiency of trial set up  data collection and interpretation and new drug  biologic and device application submission 
we offer cardiac safety services  which are utilized by clinical trial sponsors and cros during their conduct of clinical trials  including comprehensive thorough phase i ecg studies and the digital ecg franchise program  which offers a unique approach designed to address the growing capacity demands for ert s ecg services through partnerships with sponsors that desire dedicated resources within ert to address specific levels of cardiac safety monitoring transactions 
additionally  we offer the licensing and or hosting of our proprietary clinical data management software products and the provision of maintenance and consulting services in support of our proprietary clinical data management software products 
our license revenues consist of license fees for perpetual license sales and monthly and annual license sales 
our services revenues consist of cardiac safety services  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and  if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved and there are no client negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between the deliverable elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 

back to contents cost of licenses consists primarily of applications service provider asp fees for those clients that choose hosting  the cost of producing compact disks and related documentation and royalties paid to third parties in connection with their contributions to our product development 
cost of services includes the cost of cardiac safety services and the cost of technology consulting  training and maintenance services 
cost of cardiac safety services consists primarily of direct costs related to our centralized cardiac safety services and includes wages  cardiac safety equipment rent and related supplies  depreciation  shipping expenses and other direct operating costs 
cost of technology consulting  training and maintenance services consists primarily of wages  fees paid to outside consultants and other direct operating costs related to our consulting and client support functions 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of wages and commissions paid to sales personnel  travel expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and direct costs for our finance  administrative  corporate information technology and executive management functions  in addition to professional service fees and corporate insurance 
research and development expenses consist primarily of wages paid to our product development staff  costs paid to outside consultants and direct costs associated with the development of our technology products 
we conduct our operations through offices in the united states and the united kingdom uk

the increase in cardiac safety service revenues was primarily due to increased sales volume with both new and existing clients  including an increase in transactions performed and revenue from the rental of cardiac safety equipment  which our clients use to perform cardiac safety procedures 
additionally  the average revenue per transaction has increased with a shift to digital ecg processing and the implementation of project assurance fees 
the increase in technology consulting and training service revenues was primarily due to increased consulting activities for new clients as well as increases in implementation fees from new licenses 
additionally  we initiated sales of validation and standard operating procedure guides in the increase in software maintenance service revenues was primarily due to new perpetual license sales during the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of licenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of license revenues  was primarily due to a decrease in asp hosting fees associated with a change in asp hosting providers at the beginning of  including a termination fee paid to the previous asp hosting provider in additionally  the cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues decreased due to the increase in revenue from perpetual licenses that have very little incremental cost of sales 
the increase in the cost of cardiac safety services was primarily due to an increase in labor  rental and depreciation costs associated with cardiac safety rental equipment  and increased facilities and other costs associated with expanding capabilities to meet the growth in cardiac safety service revenues 
we also began amortization of our internal use software costs during the third quarter of additional internal use software costs were capitalized throughout the remainder of and through the first quarter of we began amortizing the additional capitalized costs in the second quarter of we have accelerated the amortization of certain internal use software costs due to an upgrade replacement that is scheduled to take place in the majority of these costs were to be amortized through august the increase in monthly amortization costs due to the acceleration is  commencing in the fourth quarter of and will continue through march amortization expense related to internal use software costs was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of cardiac safety services as a percentage of cardiac safety service revenues was primarily due to the fact that some of the costs are fixed in nature 
the increase in the cost of technology consulting and training services  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of technology consulting and training service revenues  was due primarily to increased third party 
back to contents consulting and labor costs associated with the increase in technology consulting and training service revenues as well as increased bonuses due to improved performance during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of software maintenance services  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of software maintenance service revenues  was due primarily to a reduction in labor  office rent  depreciation and other costs during the year ended december  as a result of a proportional decrease in allocated costs relative to other cost centers 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses was due primarily to increases in commissions that resulted from the increase in commissionable revenue  bonuses due to improved performance during and labor costs 
these items were partially offset by planned reductions in advertising expense during the year ended december  the decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to the fact that many selling and marketing expenses are discretionary in nature and can be increased or decreased as deemed necessary by management and do not necessarily increase or decrease with changes in revenue 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in insurance  public relations  bonuses and payroll taxes related to stock option exercises during the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to the fact that many of the general and administrative expenses are fixed in nature 
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in labor costs  third party consulting and bonuses during the year ended december  the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to the fact that many of the research and development expenses are fixed in nature 
other income  net  consisted primarily of interest income realized from our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  net of interest expense related to capital lease obligations 
we recorded a net realized gain of  from the sale of our shares of digital angel corporation dac formerly known as medical advisory systems  inc during additionally  during  a gain of  was recognized on the sale of the domestic clinical research operation cro to scp communications  inc and  of interest income was recorded on the escrow accounts related to this sale 
in addition to the gain on the sale of the dac shares  the gain on sale of the domestic cro and the interest income earned on the escrow accounts  all of which were realized during  the decrease in other income  net was also due to lower interest rates during the year ended december  at december   the carrying value for americasdoctor 
com  inc was  we periodically assess the fair value of americasdoctor 
com  inc and whether or not any decline in fair value below the current cost basis is deemed to be other than temporary 
if declines in the fair value of americasdoctor 
com are judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of this investment would be written down to fair value  and the amount of the write down would be included in our results 
our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the tax rate was primarily due to the non recurring reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards that was recorded in  the increase in the state tax effective rate and increased income before taxes with relatively static offsets such as tax credits for research and development of  as income increased  the impact of these tax offsets has decreased as a percentage of income before income taxes 
thus  the effective tax rate increased 
we expect this trend to continue in based on our preliminary assessment  as well as our review of other factors affecting our effective tax rate  we believe our effective tax rate will increase to approximately in the tax rate was primarily impacted by the reversal of  of valuation allowances related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards

back to contents the following table presents costs of revenues as a percentage of related net revenues and operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues year ended december  increase decrease cost of licenses cost of services cardiac safety technology consulting and training software maintenance total cost of services total costs of revenues operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development the increase in license revenues was primarily due to an increase in software licensed on a monthly and annual basis with new clients during the year ended december  the increase in cardiac safety service revenues was primarily due to increased sales volume with both new and existing clients  including an increase in revenue from the rental of cardiac safety equipment  which our clients use to perform cardiac safety procedures 
the decrease in technology consulting and training service revenues was primarily due to reductions in consulting activity for our existing clients  partially offset by increases in implementation fees from new licenses 
software maintenance service revenues did not increase proportionately with license revenues due to a low level of new license sales that included maintenance as a separate component of revenue 
annual licenses do not contain a separate maintenance component 
the increase in the cost of licenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of license revenues  was primarily due to an increase in asp hosting fees associated with expanding hosting capabilities to support additional asp accounts 
additionally  the increase was due to termination fees associated with a change in asp hosting providers in the increase in the cost of cardiac safety services was primarily due to an increase in rental and depreciation costs associated with cardiac safety rental equipment  and increased labor  facilities and other costs associated with expanding capabilities to meet the growth in cardiac safety service revenues 
we also began amortization of our internal use software costs during the third quarter of additional internal use software costs were capitalized throughout the remainder of and through the first quarter of we began amortizing the additional capitalized costs in the second quarter of the decrease in the cost of cardiac safety services as a percentage of cardiac safety service revenues was primarily due to the increase in cardiac safety service revenues without a comparable increase in costs  many of which are fixed in nature 
the decrease in the cost of technology consulting and training services  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of technology consulting and training service revenues  was due primarily to a reduction in consulting and labor costs during the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of technology consulting and training services was also due to a decrease in variable costs associated with the decrease in technology consulting and training service revenues 
the decrease in the cost of software maintenance services  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of software maintenance service revenues  was due primarily to a reduction in depreciation  travel and other costs during the year ended december  the increase in selling and marketing expenses was due primarily to increased commissionable revenue and labor and advertising costs during the year ended december  additionally  we held our users conference 
back to contents in the second quarter of we did not hold a users conference in the decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to the increase in total net revenues with a less than proportional increase in selling and marketing expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in labor expense  public relations  insurance  professional fees and facilities expense during the year ended december  this increase was partially offset by a reduction in expenses as a result of the elimination of the amortization of goodwill 
we did not record any goodwill amortization expense for the year ended december  due to the january  adoption of sfas no 
under sfas no 
 we are no longer required to amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  but such assets will be subject to testing for impairment at least annually 
we recorded  of goodwill amortization expense for the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to the increase in total net revenues with a less than proportional increase in general and administrative expenses  many of which are fixed in nature  along with the elimination of goodwill amortization 
the decrease in research and development expenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net revenues  was primarily due to a reduction in labor  travel and other related costs during the year ended december  this reduction was partially due to the capitalization of costs associated with the development of internal use software 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was also due to the increase in total net revenues without a corresponding increase in research and development expenses 
other income  net  consisted primarily of interest income realized from our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  net of interest expense related to capital lease obligations 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net realized gain of  from the sale of our remaining shares of dac formerly known as medical advisory systems  inc  and  of interest income that was earned on the escrow accounts related to the sale of the domestic clinical research operations to scp communications  inc the primary reason for the decrease in other income  net  was lower interest rates offset by the gain on dac and an increase in interest expense related to capital lease obligations during the year ended december  we recorded an investment impairment charge of million in the year ended december  this charge was primarily the result of continued negative market conditions affecting the carrying value of our investments in dac  americasdoctor 
com  inc  and innx  inc 
at december   the carrying value for americasdoctor 
com  inc was  we periodically assess the fair value of americasdoctor 
com  inc and whether or not any decline in fair value below the current cost basis is deemed to be other than temporary 
if declines in the fair value of americasdoctor 
com are judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of this investment would be written down to fair value  and the amount of the write down would be included in our results 
in december  we sold our domestic cro operations to scp communications  inc during the year ended december   we recorded  of additional gain on the sale compared to million recorded in the year ended december  during the first quarter of  we finalized the accounting for the disposition related to certain earn outs 
the escrow account that was established in connection with the transaction has been closed effective as of the last income distribution we received during the first quarter of in the first quarter of  we accrued  of dividends on preferred stock 
this preferred stock was redeemed during the second quarter of our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the tax rate was primarily impacted by the reversal of valuation allowances related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
the tax rate was primarily impacted by the investment impairment charge recognized in  for which no tax benefit was recorded  due to the uncertainty of the realization of any tax benefit associated with these long term capital losses in future periods 
the tax impact related to the investment impairment charge was partially offset by  of tax credits recorded in 
back to contents liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   our operations provided cash of million compared to million during the year ended december  the change was primarily the result of improved operating income  increased deferred revenue  depreciation and amortization and stock option income tax benefits recognized during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this change was partially offset by an increase in both accounts receivable and income taxes payable 
for the year ended december   our investing activities used cash of million compared to million during the year ended december  the change was primarily the result of the net purchases of short term investments  which totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  also  there were million of proceeds from the sales of marketable securities during the year ended december  and none during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we capitalized million of property and equipment compared to million capitalized in the increase was primarily the result of increased purchases of cardiac safety rental equipment and related computer equipment during the current year 
this equipment was used to support the increased cardiac safety activity and contributed significantly to the increase in revenues in included in property and equipment is internal use software associated with the development of a data and communications management services software product used in connection with our centralized core cardiac safety electrocardiographic services 
we capitalize our internal use software costs in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
we began amortization of million of internal use software costs in august of  which resulted in an additional amortization charge to the cost of cardiac safety services of approximately  per month 
additional internal use software costs of million were capitalized throughout the remainder of and through the first quarter of  which resulted in additional amortization charges of approximately  per month beginning in the second quarter of we started a new internal use software project in the second quarter of for which we expect to capitalize costs through the first quarter of as of december   related costs of  were capitalized and we expect to begin amortizing these costs in the first quarter of also  we began capitalizing costs associated with an upgrade to the data and communications management services software product used in connection with our centralized core cardiac safety electrocardiographic services beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through approximately the first quarter of as of december   related costs of  were capitalized and we expect to begin amortizing these costs during as this upgrade will replace many parts of the existing data and communications management services software product  we accelerated the amortization of million of certain related costs to fully amortize the associated costs by the end of the first quarter of  which resulted in an increase in amortization expense of approximately  per month beginning in the fourth quarter of in december  we sold our domestic clinical research operation to scp communications  inc the asset purchase agreement related to this sale called for two escrow accounts collectively hereinafter referred to as the escrow account from which we would be entitled to additional proceeds upon the occurrence of certain events 
in  we received million from the escrow account of which million was recorded as additional gain on sale in the fourth quarter of and million was recorded as additional gain on sale in during the year ended december   we recorded  of additional gain on the sale 
during the first quarter of  we finalized the accounting for the disposition related to certain earn outs 
the escrow account has been closed effective as of the last income distribution received during the first quarter of for the year ended december   our financing activities provided cash of million compared to  during the year ended december  the change was primarily the result of net proceeds received from the exercise of stock options during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we received million in cash from the exercise of stock options versus million in we have a line of credit arrangement with wachovia bank  national association totaling million 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the line 

back to contents we expect that existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next year 
however  there may be acquisition and other growth opportunities that require additional external financing and we may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds from the public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that such financings will be available or available on terms acceptable to us 
the following table presents contractual obligations information as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations operating leases total inflation we believe the effects of inflation and changing prices generally do not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

disclosures required by this standard are included in the notes to these financial statements 
critical accounting policies in december and december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues primarily from two sources license fees and services 
our license revenues consist of license fees for perpetual license sales and monthly and annual license sales 
our services revenues consist of cardiac safety services  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
we recognize software revenues in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position accordingly  we recognize up front license fee revenues under the residual method when a formal agreement exists  delivery of the software and related documentation has occurred  collectability is probable and the license fee is fixed or determinable 
we recognize monthly and annual license fee revenues over the term of the arrangement 
hosting service fees are recognized evenly over the term of service 
cardiac safety services revenues consist of revenues that we provide on a fee for services basis as well as revenues from the rental of cardiac safety equipment 
such revenues are recognized as the services are performed or over the rental period 
we recognize revenues from software maintenance contracts on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance contract  which is typically twelve months 
we provide consulting and training services on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues as we perform the services 
at the time of the transaction  management assesses whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the assessment of 
back to contents whether the fee is fixed or determinable is based upon the payment terms of the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms or upon implementation or client acceptance  the fee is accounted for as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is recognized as the fees become due or after implementation or client acceptance has occurred 
collectability is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client and the credit worthiness of the client 
if it is determined that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
under a typical contract for cardiac safety services  clients pay us a portion of our fee for these services upon contract execution as an upfront deposit  some of which is typically nonrefundable upon contract termination 
revenues are then recognized under cardiac safety service contracts as the services are performed 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of each element is known  the revenue is allocated to each component based on the relative fair values of each element 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of the delivered element is not known  revenue is allocated to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
fair values for undelivered elements are based primarily upon stated renewal rates for future products or services 
investments in non marketable securities we account for our investments in non marketable securities under the cost method in accordance with apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  as we do not have significant influence over our investees as defined in apb opinion no 
if a decline in the fair value of a non marketable security occurs  management is required to assess whether such a decline is other than temporary and  if so determined  the cost basis of the investment would be written down to fair value and an investment impairment charge would be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
our non marketable investments consist of investments in privately held entities for which fair values are not readily determinable 
given the nature of these investments  management s assessments of fair value are judgmental and based upon available financial and other data 
testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment including the identification of potentially impaired investments  the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary 
revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known  and any resulting impairment charges are made at that time 
management s review for impairment includes  but is not limited to  reviewing the investee s cash position  earnings and revenue outlook  liquidity and management ownership 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management having to estimate our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
management must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent management establishes or increases a valuation allowance in a period  the consolidated statement of operations will reflect additional income tax expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million primarily related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 

back to contents see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which begin on page f of this annual report on form k  and contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
risks related to our business the risk factors identified in the cautionary statements below could cause our actual results to differ materially from those suggested in the forward looking statements appearing elsewhere in this form k report 
however  these risk factors are not exhaustive  as new risks emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
accordingly  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results 
if clinical trial sponsors and cros do not shift from their existing paper based methods of collecting and managing clinical trial data to an electronic system  we may not achieve the market penetration necessary to grow the business at expected levels 
if participants conducting clinical trials are unwilling to adopt our technology solutions and new ways of conducting business  our revenues may not be sufficient to maintain the expected growth rate of market analysts and investors 
our efforts to establish a standardized  electronic process to collect  manage and analyze clinical trial and cardiac safety data are a significant departure from the traditional clinical research process 
we estimate that the vast majority of clinical trials today use manual  paper based data entry  management and analysis tools 
each clinical trial can involve a multitude of participants  including the sponsor  a cro  regional site managers  investigators and patients 
with so many participants involved in a clinical trial  it may be difficult to convince a sponsor or cro to accept new methods of conducting a clinical trial 
we may not be successful in persuading these participants to change the manner in which they have traditionally operated and to accept our products and services 
we have several large clients from whom we derive substantial revenue and therefore the loss of even a few of our clients could significantly reduce our revenues 
if we lose existing clients and do not replace them with new clients  our revenues will decrease and may not be sufficient to cover our costs 
we currently derive and expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients 
in  one client accounted for more than of net revenues 
consolidation among our clients could cause us to lose clients  decrease the market for our products and result in a reduction of our revenues 
our client base could decline because of consolidation  and we may not be able to expand sales of our products and services to new clients 
in addition  our profitability will suffer if we reduce our prices in response to competitive pressures without achieving corresponding reductions in our expenses 
consolidation in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries and among cros has accelerated in recent years  and we expect this trend to continue 
the new companies or organizations that result from such consolidation may decide that our products and services are no longer needed because of their own internal processes or the use of alternative systems 
in addition  as these industries consolidate  competition to provide products and services to industry participants will become more intense and the importance of establishing relationships with large industry participants will become greater 
these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
also  if consolidation of larger clients occurs  the combined organization may represent a larger percentage of business for us and  as a result  we are likely to rely more significantly on the combined organization s revenues to continue to achieve growth 
extensive governmental regulation of the clinical trial process could require costly modifications to our products or could adversely affect prospective clients willingness to use our products and services 
we may incur increased expenses or suffer a reduction in revenues if our products and services do not comply with applicable government regulations 
the fda has published regulations and guidelines addressing a broad range of matters relating to the use of computerized systems to collect  manage and analyze data from 
back to contents clinical trials 
moreover  electronic data entry  management and analysis of medical information pertaining to subjects in clinical trials will be subject to state and federal government regulations that are not yet finalized 
conforming our products and services to these guidelines or to future changes in regulation could substantially increase our expenses 
in the united states and in foreign countries  regulatory authorities have also established other standards for conducting clinical trials leading to the approval of new products with which we must comply 
we are subject to these regulations because our products and services assist sponsors and cros in conducting trials and preparing new drug or device applications 
if a regulatory authority concludes that trials were not conducted in accordance with established requirements  it may take a variety of enforcement actions depending upon the nature of the violation and the applicable country 
in the united states  these measures may range from issuing a warning letter or seeking injunctive relief or civil penalties to recommending criminal prosecution  which could result in a prohibition of our continued participation in future clinical trials 
in november  the fda held a public meeting at which it proposed requiring sponsors of new drugs to submit ecg raw data in digital format and annotated 
annotated data refers to the defining of measurement points and events that are used in the analysis of such data 
a more recent meeting held in january  which was supported by a preliminary concept paper issued in november  further discussed the trial design  ecg acquisition  analysis and reporting for digital ecgs 
in february  the international conference on harmonization released at step sb safety pharmacology studies for assessing the potential for delayed ventricular repolarization qt interval prolongation by human pharmaceuticals 
the objective of this guideline is to recommend the design and timing of studies in the clinical development process and provide general recommendations on available non clinical methodologies to assess the potential risk of qt interval prolongation of a pharmaceutical product 
at step  the guideline is under regulatory consideration by the three regions us  eu and japan 
the next ich meeting is scheduled for june there is currently no defined timeline for completion of step adoption of a tripartite harmonized text and step implementation by regulatory regions 
the results of the non clinical studies outlined in these guidelines contribute to the design and evaluation of clinical trials to determine the potential risk of qt prolongation in humans 
as a result  the evaluation methodology and trial designs supported by ert will be driven by the outcomes of these non clinical studies 
our clients and prospective clients will be less likely to use our products and services if the products and services do not comply with regulatory requirements in all countries where clinical trials are expected to take place or if we are precluded from participating in clinical trials in countries where trials will be conducted 
if general economic conditions worsen  potential clients may be unwilling to make large capital software purchases  which could affect our ability to maintain and or increase license revenues 
we have seen some resistance by potential clients in making the necessary large capital expenditure to license our software through our traditional one time license offering 
despite our efforts to market an annual license  our failure to continue selling one time software licenses in the near term may affect our ability to achieve growth in license revenues from year to year 
if we fail to show growth in license revenues  we may not meet the expectations of market analysts and investors  which would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our clients may not adopt our eresnet annual license solution  which could prevent us from generating recurring revenues 
if we are unable to generate the recurring revenues that securities analysts expect  our stock price will likely fall 
a key element of our business strategy is the establishment of eresnets  which are electronic research networks that integrate a combination of our products and services 
we sell monthly and annual licenses for these products 
if we are not successful in establishing eresnets and collecting monthly license fees  we will not generate the volume of recurring revenues in the future that we are expecting and our stock price will likely fall 
the eresnet annual license model is still in its early stages and is subject to uncertain market acceptance 
our clients may not adopt the concept of eresnets and may  instead  continue to use our products or services on an individual or a modular basis 
we may fail to maintain revenue and income growth 
if we do not maintain revenue and income growth  our stock price is likely to decline and we may not be able to continue to operate 

back to contents failure to maintain expected growth in profitability could reduce our cash reserves  cause the market price of our common stock to decline and ultimately cause us to discontinue operating our business 
our future operating results are uncertain and may fluctuate 
if we fail to meet the expectations of market analysts and investors  our stock price would likely decline 
if our operating results in any future period fluctuate significantly  we may not meet the expectations of market analysts and investors  which would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
it is difficult to predict the timing or amount of our revenues because we generate a significant percentage of our revenues from a limited number of clients our sales cycles are generally lengthy and variable sponsors and cros may unexpectedly cancel  postpone or reduce the size of clinical trials we make decisions on operating expenses based on anticipated revenue trends and available resources 
we also incur expenses educating and providing information to our client base  including through consultations  without any obligation by our client to purchase our products and services 
because many of our expenses are fixed and we are committed to making a significant investment in our organization and in marketing our products and services  delays in recognizing revenues could cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period 
we depend entirely on the clinical trial market and a downturn in this market could cause our revenues to decrease 
our business depends entirely on the clinical trials that pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies conduct 
our revenues will decline if there is less competition in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology or medical device industries  which would result in fewer products under development and decreased pressure to accelerate a product approval 
our revenues will also decline if the fda or similar agencies in foreign countries loosen their requirements  thereby decreasing the complexity of conducting clinical trials 
any other developments that adversely affect the pharmaceutical  biotechnology or medical device industries generally  including product liability claims  new technologies or products or general business conditions  could also decrease the volume of our business 
our failure to expand our business or manage growth successfully could disrupt our business operations  increase our costs and delay implementation of our business strategies 
difficulties in managing our future growth could disrupt our business operations  increase our costs and delay achievement of our business goals  making it more difficult for us to maintain profitability 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to expand and improve our field sales  marketing and services organization  our operations and our corporate and administrative organizations  both in the united states and throughout the world 
in order to grow  we will need to hire additional personnel 
there are a limited number of experienced personnel with an adequate knowledge of our industry  and competition for their services is intense 
in addition  we may not be able to project the rate or timing of increases in the use of products and services accurately or to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate the increases 
the expansion of our foreign operations also will require us to assimilate differences in foreign business practices  overcome language barriers and hire and retain qualified personnel abroad 
our failure to establish and maintain strategic alliances may delay the development of our products and services  cause us to lose clients and prevent us from growing our business  any of which could cause our stock price to decline 
we have relationships with providers of clinical pharmacology services  hardware and software systems  telecommunications  web hosting and development  systems integration and website content that support our sales and marketing efforts by satisfying other needs of our existing clients that our solutions do not address and by providing us access to their clients as potential sources of new business 
we do not generally have long term contracts with our strategic partners  so they may cease doing business with us on relatively short notice 
we may not be successful in competing against others providing similar products and services  which could reduce our revenues and market share 

back to contents if our products and services do not achieve widespread acceptance by our clients  our revenues and market share will likely decline 
our competitors include internal research departments of pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies  cros  software vendors and clinical trial data service companies 
our targeted clients  sponsors and cros  may decide to choose other technology based products and services generated internally by them or from another source 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources  greater name recognition and more extensive client bases than we do 
in addition  many competitors focus their efforts on providing software or services for discrete aspects of the clinical trials process and may compare favorably to us on those discrete aspects 
we may incur liability as a result of providing cardiac safety analysis and interpretation services 
we provide centralized analysis and interpretation of ecgs in connection with our clients clinical trials 
it is possible that liability may be asserted against us and the physicians who interpret the ecgs for us for failing to accurately diagnose a medical problem indicated by the ecg or for failing to disclose a medical problem to the investigator responsible for the subject being tested 
in april  an action was initiated  naming both our company and one of our physicians who was contracted by us to interpret ecg s during the relevant period  alleging we were negligent in the treatment of one of the plaintiffs  who was a participant in a clinical trial for which we provided services 
see item  legal proceedings 
if we are found liable in this action or any other action that may be initiated in the future  we may be forced to pay fines and damages and to discontinue a portion of our operations 
the contractual protections included in our client contracts and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to protect us against such liability 
if the protections are not adequate  we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability and our stock price would likely fall 
the cardiac safety equipment that we own and lease could become obsolete due to technological advances or we may not be able to provide the quantity of equipment needed to service our clients 
we own and lease equipment  which we provide to our clients to perform cardiac safety procedures 
this equipment may become obsolete due to advances in technology and the introduction of newer equipment models prior to the time that we have fully depreciated the asset or fulfilled our lease obligations 
this could result in us recording additional expense to write off the book value or the remaining lease value of the equipment 
we are also dependent on a limited number of suppliers to provide the equipment necessary to service our clients and if adequate equipment is not available we may lose clinical clients resulting in reduced revenues 
system failures or capacity constraints could result in the loss of or liability to clients  which could reduce our revenues and increase our expenses 
if our clients experience any significant level of problems with our technology  we may become liable to those clients  we may be unable to persuade our clients to change from a manual  paper based process and we may lose clients 
the success of our products and services depends on the ability to protect against software or hardware malfunctions that interrupt operation of our applications or cause loss of data integrity power loss or telecommunications failures overloaded systems human error natural disasters in addition  when we offer our software products as an application service provider  our network infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptive problems caused by our clients or other internet users 
this could also lead to delays  loss of data  interruptions or cessation of service to our clients for which we may be liable 
there is no current technology that provides absolute protection against these events 
in addition  we may find that the cost to develop or incorporate technology into our products that provides the maximum protection against these problems outweighs the incremental benefits of providing such enhanced protection 

back to contents our software products are complex and may contain undetected software errors  which could lead to an increase in our costs or a reduction in our revenues 
the occurrence of hardware and software errors  whether caused by our solutions or another vendor s products  could cause sales of our solutions to decrease and our revenues to decline cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our technical personnel away from product development efforts cause significant client relations problems complex software products such as those included in our technology solutions frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
in addition  we combine our solutions with software and hardware products from other vendors 
as a result  we may experience difficulty in identifying the source of an error 
rapidly changing technology may impair our ability to develop and market our solutions and cause us to become less competitive 
our failure to continuously offer competitive products and services could cause us to lose clients and prevent us from successfully marketing our solutions to prospective clients 
as a result  our revenues would likely decline 
because our business relies on technology  we are susceptible to rapid technological change changing client needs frequent new product introductions evolving industry standards as the internet  computer and software industries continue to experience rapid technological change  we must quickly modify our solutions to adapt to such changes 
the demands of operating in such an environment may delay or prevent our development and introduction of new or enhanced products and services that continually meet changing market demands and that keep pace with evolving industry standards 
we have experienced development delays in the past and may experience similar or more significant delays in the future 
in addition  competitors may develop products superior to our solutions  which could make our products obsolete 
we depend on certain key executives  the loss of whom could disrupt our operations  cause us to incur additional expenses and or impede our ability to expand our operations 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key executives could negatively affect our ability to achieve our business goals 
our future performance will depend significantly on the continued service and performance of all of our executives  particularly dr 
joel morganroth  our chairman of the board of directors and chief scientist  and mr 
joseph a 
esposito  our president and chief executive officer 
we also depend on our key technical  client support  sales and other managerial employees 
we believe that it would be costly and time consuming to find suitable replacements for these employees 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology or maintain our technological advantages  we may lose our intellectual property rights and become less competitive 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property from infringement  other companies may use our intellectual property to offer competitive products at lower prices 
if we fail to compete effectively against these companies  we could lose clients and experience a decline in sales of our solutions and revenues 
to protect our intellectual property rights  we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products and technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

back to contents third parties may claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights  which could result in the loss of our rights  subject us to liability and divert management attention 
although we are not currently involved in any intellectual property litigation  we may be a party to litigation in the future either to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property of others 
these claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability or invalidate our ownership rights in the technology used in our solutions 
as a result  we may have to stop selling our solutions 
litigation  regardless of the merits of the claim or outcome  could consume a great deal of our time and money and would divert management time and attention away from our core business 
any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following stop using the challenged intellectual property or selling our products or services that incorporate it obtain a license to use the challenged intellectual property or to sell products or services that incorporate it  which could be costly or unavailable redesign those products or services that are based on or incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which could be costly and time consuming or could adversely affect the functionality and market acceptance of our products if we must take any of the foregoing actions  we may be unable to sell our solutions  which would substantially reduce our revenues 
our international operations expose us to additional risks 
a key element of our business strategy is to expand our international operations 
we face a number of risks and expenses that are inherent in operating in foreign countries and  accordingly  our international operations may not achieve profitability consistently each year 
the risks to us from our international operations include government regulations trade restrictions burdensome foreign taxes exchange rate controls and currency exchange rate fluctuations political and economic instability varying technology standards difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations we are subject to a variety of government regulations in the countries where we market our products and services 
we currently operate in the united kingdom through a foreign subsidiary and may operate in other countries through additional foreign subsidiaries 
if we form foreign subsidiaries outside of the united kingdom  we may need to withhold taxes on earnings or other payments they distribute to us 
generally  we can claim a foreign tax credit against our federal income tax expense for these taxes 
however  the united states tax laws have a number of limitations on our ability to claim that credit or to use any foreign tax losses  which could result in higher payment by us of taxes in the united states 
we may also need to include our share of our foreign subsidiaries earnings in our income even if the subsidiaries do not distribute money to us 
as a result  less cash would be available to us in the united states 
our global operations may involve transactions in a variety of currencies 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could reduce our reported revenues or increase our reported expenses 
we currently do not utilize hedging investments 
the agreements that we sign with clients outside the united states may be governed by the laws of the countries where we provide our products and services 
we may also need to resolve any disputes under these agreements in the courts or other dispute resolution forums in those countries 
this could be expensive or could distract management s attention away from our core business 

back to contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary financial market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we generally place our investments in money market funds  municipal securities  bonds of government sponsored agencies  certificates of deposit with fixed rates with maturities of less than one year  and ap rated commercial bonds and paper 
we actively manage our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments  but in order to ensure liquidity  will only invest in instruments with high credit quality where a secondary market exists 
we have not held and do not hold any derivatives related to our interest rate exposure 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of our investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by less than  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
see liquidity and capital resources as part of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
foreign currency risk we operate on a global basis from locations in the united states and the united kingdom 
all international net revenues are billed and expenses incurred in either us dollars or pounds sterling 
as such  we face exposure to adverse movements in the exchange rate of the pound sterling 
as the currency rate changes  translation of the income statement of our uk subsidiary from the local currency to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge translation risks because any cash flows from uk operations are generally reinvested in the uk 
management estimates that a change in the exchange rate of the pound sterling would have impacted the reported operating income for the year ended december  by less than
