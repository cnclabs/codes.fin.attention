item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview since our inception  we have been engaged in developing drugs for the treatment of a variety of human diseases 
our lead program is the development of plenaxis abarelix for injectable suspension  a drug for the treatment of diseases that respond to the lowering of certain hormone levels 
in november  the fda approved plenaxis for the treatment of the symptoms of men with advanced prostate cancer for whom other hormonal therapies are not appropriate and who have refused surgical castration 
for safety reasons  plenaxis was approved with marketing restrictions 
only physicians enrolled in the plus plenaxis user safety program may prescribe plenaxis 
we are promoting plenaxis in the united states through our own dedicated marketing and sales team 
in june  we initiated the regulatory submission process in the european union seeking approval to market plenaxis for the treatment of a broad population of hormonally responsive prostate cancer patients 
we submitted a marketing authorization application  or maa  in germany and  assuming a favorable action in germany  plan to seek additional european union member state approvals under the mutual recognition procedure  or mrp 
we believe that the german review process will be completed during we are in discussions with potential partners for the commercialization of plenaxis in europe  as well as for the development and or commercialization of plenaxis in japan and other areas of the world 
we are conducting clinical trials of apan  our proprietary drug candidate for the treatment of alzheimer s disease 
ppi is our proprietary compound in development for the potential treatment of a wide range of cancers  as well as certain autoimmune diseases 
during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a phase i clinical trial to study ppi in patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma 
in march  the fda placed this trial on clinical hold 
we also have other programs in the research or preclinical development stage 
since our inception  we have had no revenues from product sales 
substantially all of our expenditures to date have been for drug development and commercialization activities and for general and administrative expenses 
in the past  a significant portion of our revenues was received under collaboration agreements through which we converted the potential value underlying our plenaxis program into a stream of upfront  milestone and expense reimbursement payments from corporate collaborators 
in  we regained full ownership of our plenaxis program and  as a result  all revenues and ongoing financial obligations under our former collaboration agreements have ended 
we had entered into collaborations with amgen and sanofi synth labo to develop and commercialize our plenaxis products 
in september  amgen notified us that it was terminating its agreement with us 
in october  sanofi synth labo notified us that it was terminating its agreement with us 
both terminations were effective in december as a result  all of the licenses for plenaxis granted to amgen and sanofi synth labo under these agreements  and all rights of amgen and sanofi synth labo in the plenaxis program  have terminated 
in  we entered into an agreement relating to the termination of these collaborations with each of amgen and sanofi synth labo 
due primarily to the costs associated with the commercialization of plenaxis in the united states  as well as other research and development and general and administrative expenses  and our lack of revenues  we had a net operating loss during our accumulated deficit as of december  was approximately million 
we expect to continue to have net operating losses through we began selling plenaxis in the united states in january assuming the successful commercialization of plenaxis  partnering of clinical programs at opportune times and continued prudent fiscal management  we believe that our existing cash and investments will be sufficient for us to execute our current operating plan and attain profitability by the market for currently available hormonal therapies to treat prostate cancer is approximately billion in the united states 
we believe that the revenue opportunity for plenaxis  based upon its approved indication  may represent or more of this market 
however  our actual revenues will depend upon the impact of our risk management program  physician and patient acceptance of plenaxis and the overall success of our commercialization efforts 
at december   we had full time employees  of whom were engaged in research and development activities  compared to full time employees at december   of whom were engaged in research and development activities 
the termination of our collaboration agreement with sanofi synth labo became effective as of december  and we received a final reimbursement payment of approximately million during the second quarter of including this payment  we recognized a total of approximately million in non refundable fees and performance based payments  and a total of approximately million in reimbursement for ongoing development costs under this agreement 
the termination of our collaboration agreement with amgen became effective as of december  under the amgen agreement  amgen paid the first million of all authorized costs and expenses associated with the research  development and commercialization of plenaxis products in the united states 
amgen s initial million funding commitment was fulfilled during the third quarter of following amgen s completion of this funding  we became responsible for one half of all subsequent united states research and development costs for plenaxis products 
additionally  the agreement provided that following amgen s completion of its million funding commitment  we were required to reimburse amgen for one half of the costs associated with establishing a sales and marketing infrastructure for plenaxis products in the united states 
through december   we recognized an aggregate of approximately million of revenues under the amgen agreement 
on august   we executed a termination agreement with amgen 
in accordance with this agreement  we made a final payment to amgen of million 
this payment represented full and complete satisfaction of our share of the expenses incurred under the collaboration agreement  as well as consideration for the receipt from amgen of full title to  and possession of  all materials inventory purchased during the term of the collaboration 
as a result  we recognized a gain of million during the third quarter of critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the commission indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical use of estimates 
we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require that we make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reporting of our assets and our liabilities as well as the disclosures that we make regarding assets and liabilities and income and expense that are contingent upon uncertain factors as of the reporting date 
the actual payments  and thus our actual results  could differ from our estimates 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
 requires that if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from a company s asset  net of interest charges  is less than the reported value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
we evaluate our property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the amount of the impairment to be recognized is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the reported value of the asset 
we believe that the application of sfas no 
and the method used to determine the impairment of our property  plant and equipment involve critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period and because they require management to make assumptions about future cash flows  including residual values 
in addition  we believe that had alternative assumptions been used the impact of recognizing an impairment on the assets reported on our balance sheet  as well as our net loss  may have been material 
we reviewed our building for impairment as of december  we have determined that the undiscounted sum of the expected future cash flows from the building exceeded the recorded value of the building 
as a result  no impairment allowance was required in accordance with sfas no 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december  were zero compared to approximately million in during our revenues were comprised of a final reimbursement payment received in connection with the termination of our agreement with sanofi synth labo 
we expect our only sources of revenues during to be from sales of plenaxis in the united states and potential payments under foreign plenaxis collaboration agreements  if consummated 
we have previously forecast plenaxis product revenues to be in the million to million range in we anticipate that these revenues will be heavily weighted towards the second half of our actual revenues will depend upon a number of factors  including the impact of our risk management program  physician and patient acceptance of plenaxis  the timing of reimbursement coverage and the overall success of our commercialization efforts 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in the decrease in expenses reflects reduced spending in our clinical and preclinical programs 
as a result of the resubmission of the plenaxis nda in february  spending on the prostate cancer clinical development program was reduced significantly 
we incurred no direct expenses in connection with our endometriosis program during pending a decision regarding further development  and do not expect any additional spending on this program for the foreseeable future 
during the second quarter of  we initiated a phase ib clinical trial for apan and expect to complete this study during the first half of we initiated a phase i clinical trial for ppi in patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma during the fourth quarter of in march  the fda placed this trial on clinical hold 
overall  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in and thereafter  primarily due to additional post marketing studies for plenaxis  preclinical and clinical studies for apan and ppi  and the expansion of our core technology platform  direct select 
in addition  we currently have several other ongoing research and development programs 
while we are generally able to forecast our overall spending on research and development  we are unable to predict the precise level of spending on individual clinical programs due to the uncertain nature of clinical development and the potential for future development partnerships 
using industry estimates  typical drug development programs may last for ten or more years and may cost hundreds of millions of dollars to complete 
as our programs progress  we will assess the possibility of entering into corporate collaborations to offset a portion of development costs 
the ultimate success of our research and development programs and the impact of these programs on our operations and financial results cannot be accurately predicted and will depend  in large part  upon the outcome and timing of many variables outside of our control 
members of our research and development team typically work on a number of projects concurrently 
in addition  a substantial amount of our fixed costs such as facility depreciation  utilities and maintenance are shared by our various programs 
accordingly  we have not and do not plan to specifically identify all costs related to each of our research and development programs 
we estimate that during and  the majority of our research and development expenses were related to manufacturing costs  clinical trial costs  salaries and lab supplies related to our prostate cancer  alzheimer s disease and non hodgkin s lymphoma programs 
the remaining research and development costs consisted primarily of salaries and lab supplies for our other research programs 
we began our clinical program to develop plenaxis for the treatment of prostate cancer during in december  we submitted an nda to the fda for plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive prostate cancer 
however  the fda raised concerns over the occurrence of immediate onset  systemic allergic reactions observed in approximately of all clinical trial patients dosed with plenaxis 
in addition  the fda expressed concern that the effectiveness of plenaxis in suppressing testosterone decreased with continued dosing in some patients 
in november  the fda approved plenaxis for the palliative treatment of men with advanced symptomatic prostate cancer  in whom lhrh agonist therapy is not appropriate and who refuse surgical castration  and have one or more of the following risk of neurological compromise due to metastases  ureteral or bladder outlet obstruction due to local encroachment or metastatic disease  or severe bone pain from skeletal metastases persisting on narcotic analgesia 
plenaxis is not indicated for use in women or children 
for safety reasons  plenaxis was approved with marketing restrictions 
only physicians enrolled in the plus program may prescribe plenaxis 
in june  we also submitted an maa for plenaxis in germany 
we believe that the german regulatory authorities will complete their review of our maa during assuming a favorable action  we plan to subsequently seek further european union approval for plenaxis under the mrp to market plenaxis for the treatment of a broad population of hormonally responsive prostate cancer patients 
we are in discussions with potential partners for the commercialization of plenaxis in europe  as well as for the development and or commercialization of plenaxis in japan and other areas of the world 
however  we cannot assure investors that we will be successful in obtaining approval abroad for the commercialization of plenaxis for the treatment of any portion of the hormonally responsive prostate cancer patient population or for any other indication  or that we will be able to enter into collaboration agreements on favorable terms  if at all 
in  we began our clinical program to develop plenaxis for the treatment of endometriosis 
we completed a phase ii study of plenaxis for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis in march analysis of the results of this study indicates that patients treated with plenaxis experienced more bone mineral density loss than those treated with the comparator drug  and that this loss was dose related 
in order to better understand the bone mineral density loss  during and we conducted a pharmacokinetic study of plenaxis for the treatment of endometriosis to determine the appropriate dose and dosing schedule necessary to maximize the benefit of the therapy for patients while minimizing attendant bone mineral density loss 
the results of this study will be used as guidance for potential future clinical studies 
we do not currently have any additional endometriosis studies planned and do not expect to conduct further studies without a corporate partner 
any additional development in endometriosis would also require consultation with the fda 
we began our clinical program for apan in we have completed a normal volunteer  phase ia dose escalation study of apan and have identified a maximum tolerated dose  or mtd  in healthy volunteers 
during the second quarter of  we initiated a phase ib trial of apan in alzheimer s disease patients 
in this trial  a single dose of apan is administered  with the goal of establishing the mtd in patients 
we anticipate completing this study during the first half of upon completion of the phase ib study and  assuming favorable fda review of the study s results  we intend to initiate a phase ic trial examining multiple administrations of a selected apan dose in alzheimer s disease patients 
we initiated our first clinical study for ppi during the fourth quarter of in which an oral formulation of ppi is being evaluated in non hodgkin s lymphoma patients who are no longer benefiting from other therapies 
in march  the fda placed this trial on clinical hold until questions relating to a neuropathological abnormality observed in some of the animals tested in a recently completed three month animal safety study have been satisfactorily resolved 
the results of this study were not available at the time that the clinical study was initiated 
the fda has indicated that we will need to submit a detailed plan in order to address this finding 
we intend to further explore this finding to assess its potential implications and prepare a plan for the fda 
while we intend to work diligently with the fda to resolve this issue  we cannot currently predict when the clinical hold will be released 
we intend to continue evaluating the potential utility of ppi for treating certain other cancers  as well as certain autoimmune diseases 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  increased by approximately million to approximately million  from approximately million in during  we incurred increased sales and marketing expenses in preparation for the launch of plenaxis in the united states 
this was due to increased costs related to pre commercialization efforts  in particular for market research  various physician and national meetings  pricing and reimbursement consulting  and sales force hiring and deployment activities 
we promote plenaxis in the united states through our own marketing and sales team 
with the recent fda approval of plenaxis  we expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase during and will include expenses relating to the building of a marketing infrastructure  the cost of our sales force  commissions to the sales force on plenaxis sales  and promotional and marketing programs 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  from approximately million in we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase slightly during and thereafter based on normal hiring of additional administrative personnel to support continued growth of our commercialization initiatives and our research and development activities 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in the decrease in net interest income was due primarily to lower average cash balances and reduced average interest rates 
the provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and was zero 
we anticipate that we will continue to be in a net operating loss carryforward position for the next several years 
therefore  as in  no benefit from our operating losses has been recognized 
we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  valuation allowances  in amounts equal to the net deferred tax assets as of december  and  have been established in each period to reflect these uncertainties 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million that will expire in varying amounts through  if not utilized 
utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be subject to substantial annual limitations under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in the decrease in revenues was the result of the termination during the fourth quarter of of our collaboration agreements with amgen and sanofi synth labo 
during our revenues were comprised principally of reimbursement revenues under these agreements 
during our revenues were comprised of a final reimbursement payment received in connection with the termination of our agreement with sanofi synth labo 
we will not receive any additional revenues under these agreements 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in the slight decrease in expenses primarily reflects reduced spending in our plenaxis prostate cancer clinical program and  to a lesser extent  the lack of spending on our clinical program for latranal  an in licensed compound that was in development for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain 
development of latranal was discontinued during the third quarter of these decreases were partially offset by increased spending on preclinical studies related to our experimental drug candidate ppi sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in during  we incurred increased sales and marketing expenses in preparation for the potential launch of plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer 
the subsequent decrease in sales and marketing expenses was due to the temporary suspension of the majority of marketing efforts resulting from the repositioning of our prostate cancer program in response to issues raised by the fda 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  from approximately million in this increase was due primarily to higher facility related expenses 
in may  we occupied our new  larger facility and began incurring depreciation expense and increased utilities  maintenance and tax expenses 
in addition  higher personnel related operating costs and increased professional services expenses contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for and going forward fully reflect these new facility related expenses 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in the decrease in net interest income was due primarily to lower average cash balances and reduced average interest rates 
the provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and was zero 
we anticipate that we will continue to be in a net operating loss carryforward position for the next several years 
therefore  no benefit from our operating losses in these years has been recognized 
selected quarterly operating results the following table sets forth our unaudited statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters ended december  this information has been derived from our unaudited financial statements 
the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing in this report and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring accruals  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our annual audited financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report

 in thousands  except per share data total revenues  operating loss      net loss      basic and diluted net loss per share in august  we executed a termination agreement with amgen and recognized a gain on termination of million 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results in the future  and  therefore  we will continue to have difficulty providing an accurate forecast of our quarterly revenues and operating results 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as any indication of future performance 
operating results in one or more future quarters may be different from the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in the event that our operating results are lower than expectations  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
liquidity and capital resources to date  our operations and capital requirements have been financed primarily with the proceeds of public and private sales of common stock and preferred stock  payments under research and development partnerships and collaborative agreements  and investment income 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million and working capital of approximately million  compared to approximately million and million  respectively  at december  we expect our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  to range from approximately million to million 
we believe that our existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs through approximately the end of assuming the successful commercialization of plenaxis in the united states  partnering of clinical programs at opportune times and continued prudent fiscal management  we believe that we should have sufficient financial resources to execute our operating plan and attain profitability by for the year ended december   net cash of approximately million was used in operating activities  compared to approximately million used in operating activities during during the year ended december   our use of cash in operations was due principally to our net loss of approximately million  partially offset by depreciation and amortization 
during the year ended december   our use of cash in operations was due principally to our net loss of approximately million  and our payment of million in connection with the amgen termination agreement  partially offset by depreciation and amortization 
we expect our cash utilization to increase during as a result of an overall increase in operating expenses as we continue launch related activities for plenaxis  continue with clinical trials for apan  continue preclinical and clinical trials for ppi  and expand our research and development initiatives 
we also expect a significant use of cash in relation to the production of inventory and buildup of accounts receivable related to plenaxis 
we expect to continue to utilize cash to increase the amount of inventory on hand through the end of fiscal year to support commercial sales of plenaxis 
the actual amount of these expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the timing of expenses and the timing and progress of our research  development  marketing and sales efforts 
net cash provided by investing activities of approximately million in consisted of net sales of marketable securities of approximately million and purchases of property and equipment of approximately million 
this compares to net cash used in investing activities of approximately million during net cash used in investing activities in consisted of purchases of property and equipment of approximately million  and net purchases of marketable securities of approximately million 
our financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of approximately million of proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options and approximately million in principal repayments under our acquisition and construction loan agreement described below 
our financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of approximately million of proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options 
in july  in connection with the purchase  through our wholly owned real estate subsidiary  of our corporate headquarters and research facility in waltham  massachusetts  the subsidiary entered into an acquisition and construction loan agreement providing for up to million in financing for the acquisition of  and improvements to  the facility 
the loan is secured by the facility  together with all fixtures  equipment  improvements and other related items  and by all rents  income or profits received by our real estate subsidiary  and is unconditionally guaranteed by us 
as of december   approximately million was outstanding under the loan agreement 
advances bear interest at a rate equal to the day libor plus at december  
principal and interest are payable monthly in arrears 
in july  we exercised the first of two one year extension options  extending the maturity date of the loan until july  as a result of this extension  in august we started making monthly principal payments on the loan of approximately  in addition to interest payments 
in connection with this extension  we also entered into an interest rate cap agreement in order to reduce the potential impact of interest rate increases on future income 
during  we expect to either exercise the second one year extension option available to us or refinance the debt instrument for a longer term 
in addition to our long term debt  we have fixed purchase obligations under various supply agreements 
as of december   our long term debt and fixed purchase obligations were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt obligations   unconditional purchase obligations    total    in january  we agreed with cambrex charles city  inc to a minimum purchase commitment of  for in addition  based upon the first commercial shipment of plenaxis made in january  our minimum annual purchase commitment from baxter pharmaceutical solutions llc will increase to  in these amounts are reflected in the table above 
at december   we had provided a valuation allowance of million for our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance represents the value of the deferred tax assets 
due to anticipated operating losses in the future  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the net deferred tax assets in the future and we have provided an appropriate valuation allowance 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  or sfas no 
sfas no 
amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
 to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and accounting principles board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to include increased pro forma disclosure of the effects of stock based employee compensation on the results of operations 
sfas no 
became effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company has elected to continue to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method as described in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations in in january  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin no 
fin no 
sets forth the criteria used in determining whether an investment in a variable interest entity  or vie  should be consolidated and is based on the general premise that companies that control another entity through interests other than voting interests should consolidate the controlled entity 
we do not have any vie s 
accordingly  the implementation of fin no 
will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  or sfas no 
sfas no 
establishes how a company classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  including redeemable convertible preferred stock 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the interim period commencing july   except for mandatory redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic companies 
the financial accounting standards board has indefinitely deferred implementation of some provisions of sfas no 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors that may affect future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we have a history of losses and anticipate significant increases in our operating expenses over the next several years  and we may not be profitable in the future 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future or  if we attain profitability  that it will be sustainable 
in november  we received fda approval to market plenaxis for the treatment of the symptoms of men with advanced prostate cancer for whom other hormonal therapies are not appropriate and who have refused surgical castration 
all of our other product candidates are in the research or development stage 
sales of plenaxis began in january prior to the launch of plenaxis  we had never marketed or sold any products  and we may not succeed in marketing or selling plenaxis  or developing and marketing any product in the future 
to date  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from payments under corporate collaboration and license agreements 
we expect to continue to spend significant amounts to further develop our commercial sales and marketing capabilities  continue clinical studies and seek regulatory approval for our other product candidates 
we also intend to spend substantial amounts to fund additional research and development for other potential products  enhance our core technologies  and for general and administrative purposes 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly due primarily to increased expenses related to continued commercialization activities for plenaxis  as well as the initiation and continuation of studies as part of our other clinical programs  resulting in significant operating losses at least through we currently do not expect to achieve profitability until at the earliest 
moreover  our ability to attain profitability by is dependent on numerous factors  including our ability to successfully commercialize plenaxis in the united states  partnering of clinical programs at opportune times and continued prudent fiscal management 
even if we do become profitable  we cannot assure you that we would be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our business is dependent on the commercial success of plenaxis 
if plenaxis fails to achieve market acceptance  it may never be commercially successful and we may be unable to continue our operations as planned 
the success of our business is dependent on the successful commercialization of plenaxis 
plenaxis is new to the market and may be unfamiliar to members of the medical community and to patients 
market acceptance will depend largely on our ability to demonstrate  to the oncology and urology communities in particular  the efficacy and safety of plenaxis as an alternative to currently marketed therapies or surgical options 
we cannot be certain that plenaxis will provide benefits considered adequate by providers of oncology and urology services or that enough providers will use the product to ensure its commercial success 
many factors may affect its market acceptance and commercial success of plenaxis  including the scope of the patient population and the indication for which plenaxis was approved  the terms of the risk management program required by the fda in connection with the approval of plenaxis  the product labeling and product insert required by the fda  the effectiveness of plenaxis and the potential side effects  including the risk of immediate onset systemic allergic reactions  as compared to alternative treatment methods  the extent and success of our marketing and sales efforts  the cost effectiveness of plenaxis and the availability of insurance or other third party reimbursement  in particular medicare  for patients  and the rate of such reimbursement  the competitive features of plenaxis as compared to other products or treatment options  including the frequency of administration of plenaxis as compared to other products  and doctor and patient acceptance of these features  and unfavorable publicity concerning plenaxis or any similar products 
in addition  we must continually submit any labeling  advertising and promotional material to the fda for review and pre approval 
there is risk that the fda will prohibit use of the marketing material in the form we desire 
unfavorable outcomes resulting from factors such as those identified above could limit sales of plenaxis or cause sales of plenaxis to decline 
in those circumstances  we may have to find additional sources of funding or scale back or cease operations 
if plenaxis is not commercially successful  we may be unable to continue our operations as planned 
we may be unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities necessary to successfully commercialize plenaxis or our other potential products 
we have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and have limited marketing and sales resources 
to achieve commercial success for plenaxis  or any other approved product  we must either develop a marketing and sales force  as well as the infrastructure to support it  or enter into arrangements with others to market and sell our products 
we have determined to promote plenaxis in the united states through our own dedicated marketing and sales team 
recruiting and retaining qualified sales personnel is therefore critical to our success 
competition for skilled personnel is intense  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals to successfully launch plenaxis 
accordingly  we may be unable to establish marketing  sales and distribution capabilities necessary to commercialize and gain market acceptance for plenaxis 
in addition  establishing the expertise necessary to successfully market and sell plenaxis  or any other product  will require a substantial capital investment 
our ability to make that investment and also execute our current operating plan and attain profitability by is dependent on numerous factors  including  as described above  partnering of clinical programs at opportune times and continued prudent fiscal management 
accordingly  we cannot assure investors that we will have the funds to successfully commercialize plenaxis or any other potential product in the united states or elsewhere 
moreover  plenaxis competes  and our product candidates in development are likely to compete  with products of other companies that currently have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations 
because these companies are capable of devoting significantly greater resources to their marketing and sales efforts  our marketing and sales efforts may not compete successfully against the efforts of these other companies 
we have also announced our intention to market and sell plenaxis outside of the united states through one or more marketing partners upon receipt of approval abroad 
we have not entered into any such arrangements and we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into agreements with third parties on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  co promotion or other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize plenaxis or any other potential products could significantly limit the revenues we derive from these products  and these third parties may fail to commercialize plenaxis or our other potential products successfully 
to the extent we enter into any such agreements  the parties to those agreements may also market products that compete with our products  further limiting our potential revenue from product sales 
alternative treatment options exist and may be more readily available or acceptable to physicians and patients  which may impair our ability to capture or maintain market share for plenaxis 
alternative products and medical treatments exist or are under development to treat advanced symptomatic prostate cancer 
for example  the fda has approved several drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer that respond to changes in hormone levels  and there are other treatment alternatives available  including radiation therapy and surgery 
the fda s approval of plenaxis is limited to use in a subset of advanced symptomatic prostate cancer patients  and distribution of plenaxis will only be made in accordance with our risk management program  which includes physician enrollment in a prescribing program and a signed patient consent form regarding the risks and benefits of the therapy 
due to the potential risk of immediate onset systemic allergic reactions  physicians must also monitor patients for minutes following the injection of plenaxis 
prescribing physicians and patients may view these requirements as burdensome or may recommend or choose to use alternative treatments that are more readily available or more acceptable to the doctor and or the patient 
if  due to these factors  plenaxis does not achieve broad market acceptance as a drug for the treatment of the symptoms of men with advanced prostate cancer for whom other hormonal therapies are not appropriate and who have refused surgical castration  we may be unable to continue our operations as planned 
our potential revenues will diminish if we fail to obtain adequate reimbursement coverage for plenaxis or our other product candidates from third party payors 
the continuing efforts of government and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may limit our commercial opportunity 
if government and other third party payors do not provide appropriate coverage and adequate reimbursement for plenaxis or our other product candidates  physicians may not prescribe them 
additionally  physicians may not prescribe plenaxis if we fail to provide adequate education about its benefits and uses 
in some foreign markets  pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls 
in addition  managed care initiatives in the united states will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products 
our ability to earn revenues from plenaxis  or any other potential product  alone or with collaborators  may depend in part on the availability and levels of reimbursement from government and health administration authorities  including medicare and medicaid  private health insurers  and other third party payors 
we cannot predict the availability of coverage or reimbursement for newly approved drugs such as plenaxis by medicare or any other payor 
third party payors  including medicare  are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
government and other third party payors increasingly are limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and  in some cases  refusing to provide coverage for a patient s use of an approved drug for purposes not approved by the fda 
third party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for plenaxis or any of our other products 
we may experience pressure to lower the price of plenaxis or our other potential products because of new and or proposed federal legislation 
new federal legislation  enacted in december  has altered the way in which physician administered drugs covered by medicare are reimbursed  generally leading to lower reimbursement levels 
the new legislation has also added an outpatient prescription drug benefit to medicare  effective january in the interim  congress has established a discount drug card program for medicare beneficiaries 
both benefits will be provided primarily through private entities  which will attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers 
these negotiations may increase pressures to lower prices 
while the new law specifically prohibits the united states government from interfering in price negotiations between manufacturers and medicare drug plan sponsors  some members of congress are pursuing legislation that would permit the united states government to use its enormous purchasing power to demand discounts from pharmaceutical companies  thereby creating de facto price controls on prescription drugs 
in addition  the new law contains triggers for congressional consideration of cost containment measures for medicare in the event medicare cost increases exceed a certain level 
these cost containment measures could include some sorts of limitations on prescription drug prices 
as plenaxis is used commercially  unintended side effects or adverse reactions could occur that could result in additional regulatory controls and reduced sales 
during research and development  the use of pharmaceutical products  such as plenaxis  is limited principally to clinical trial patients under controlled conditions and under the care of expert physicians 
the widespread commercial use of plenaxis could produce undesirable or unintended side effects that have not been evident in our clinical trials 
in addition  in patients who take multiple medications  drug interactions could occur that can be difficult to predict 
these events  among others  could result in the imposition of additional regulatory controls that could limit the circumstances under which plenaxis is prescribed or even lead to the withdrawal of the product from the market 
due to the occurrence of immediate onset systemic allergic reactions in patients treated with plenaxis during clinical trials  plenaxis has been approved under regulations concerning drugs with certain safety profiles  under which the fda has established special restrictions to ensure safe use 
post marketing phase iv studies are also required to evaluate the incidence of and further characterize such allergic reactions to the extent they occur 
any violation of these special restrictions or unfavorable findings in the phase iv studies could lead to the imposition of further restrictions or withdrawal of plenaxis from the market 
if we fail to develop and maintain our relationships with third party manufacturers  or if these manufacturers fail to perform adequately  we may be unable to commercialize plenaxis or any of our product candidates 
our ability to conduct  or continue to conduct  clinical trials and commercialize plenaxis or other product candidates  will depend in part on our ability to manufacture  or arrange for third party manufacture of  our products on a large scale  at a competitive cost and in accordance with regulatory requirements 
we must establish and maintain a commercial scale formulation and manufacturing process for each of our potential products for which we seek marketing approval 
we or third party manufacturers may encounter difficulties with these processes at any time that could result in delays in clinical trials  regulatory submissions or in the commercialization of potential products 
we have no experience in large scale product manufacturing  nor do we have the resources or facilities to manufacture products on a commercial scale 
we will continue to rely upon contract manufacturers to produce plenaxis and other compounds for later stage preclinical  clinical and commercial purposes for a significant period of time 
third party manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs as to timing  quantity or quality of materials 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of needed materials on acceptable terms  or if we encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers  our clinical trials may be delayed  thereby preventing or delaying the submission of product candidates for  or the granting of  regulatory approval and the commercialization of our potential products 
any such delays may lower our revenues and delay or prevent our attaining or maintaining profitability 
if the third party manufacturers upon which we rely fail to meet our needs for clinical or commercial supply  we may be required to supplement our manufacturing capacity by building our own manufacturing facilities 
this would require substantial expenditures 
also  we would need to hire and train significant numbers of employees to staff a new facility 
if we are required to build our own facility  we may not be able to develop sufficient manufacturing capacity to produce drug materials for clinical trials or commercial use 
in addition  we and the third party manufacturers that we use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practice requirements enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if our facilities or the facilities of third party manufacturers cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda pre market approval of our product candidates will not be granted 
in complying with these regulations and foreign regulatory requirements  we and any of our third party manufacturers will be obligated to expend time  money and effort in production  record keeping and quality control to assure that our potential products meet applicable specifications and other requirements 
if we or any of our third party manufacturers fail to comply with these requirements  we may be subject to regulatory sanctions  and the facilities could be shut down 
any of these factors could prevent  or cause delays in  obtaining regulatory approvals for our potential products  and the manufacturing  marketing or selling of plenaxis  and could also result in significantly higher operating expenses 
the loss or failure of any of our third party manufacturers could substantially delay or impair our sale or continued sale of plenaxis 
for each stage of plenaxis production we have relied  and expect in the near term to continue to rely  on a single third party manufacturer  and we currently have not contracted  and in the near term do not expect to contract  with a second supplier for any of these production stages 
accordingly  the loss of one or more of these suppliers for any reason  including as a result of fire  terrorism  acts of god or insolvency or bankruptcy  could result in substantial delays in  or substantially impair our ability to complete  clinical trials and regulatory submissions or reviews  and could delay or impair substantially our sale or continued sale of plenaxis 
such delays or impairment  and the associated costs and expenses  may lower our potential revenues and delay or prevent our attaining profitability 
while we are evaluating the possibility of a second source of supply at certain stages of plenaxis production  the number of qualified alternative suppliers is limited  and we cannot assure investors that we will be able to locate alternative suppliers or negotiate second supply agreements on reasonable terms 
furthermore  the process of engineering a new supplier s facility for the production of plenaxis and obtaining the necessary fda approval of the facility would require substantial lead time and could be extremely costly 
we cannot assure investors that we will not lose one or more of our suppliers  or that in such event we would be readily able to continue the commercialization of plenaxis without substantial and costly delays 
we are subject to extensive government regulation that increases our costs and could prevent us from selling plenaxis or our other potential products 
the development and sale of plenaxis  and our product candidates  is subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities 
obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval typically is costly and takes many years 
regulatory authorities  most importantly  the fda  have substantial discretion to place on clinical hold or terminate clinical trials  delay  withhold or withdraw registration and marketing approval in the united states  and effectively mandate product recalls 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production or injunction  as well as other actions as to plenaxis  our other potential products or against us 
outside the united states  we can market a product only if we receive marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
this foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the fda approval process  and may include additional risks 
to gain regulatory approval from the fda and foreign regulatory authorities for the commercial sale of any product  we must demonstrate in clinical trials  and satisfy the fda and foreign regulatory authorities as to  the safety and efficacy of the product 
if we develop a product to treat a long lasting disease  such as cancer or alzheimer s disease  we must gather data over an extended period of time 
there are many risks associated with our clinical trials 
for example  we may be unable to achieve the same level of success in later trials as we did in earlier ones 
additionally  data we obtain from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could impede regulatory approval 
further  some patients in our prostate cancer  alzheimer s disease and non hodgkin s lymphoma programs have a high risk of death  age related disease or other adverse medical events that may not be related to our products 
these events may affect the statistical analysis of the safety and efficacy of our products 
if we obtain regulatory approval for a product  the approval will be limited to those diseases for which our clinical trials demonstrate the product is safe and effective 
in addition  many factors could delay or result in termination of our ongoing or future clinical trials 
for example  results from ongoing preclinical studies or analyses could raise concerns over the safety or efficacy of a product candidate 
the fda recently placed our phase i clinical trial of ppi on clinical hold due to a neuropathological abnormality observed in some of the animals tested in a recently completed three month animal safety study 
the fda has indicated that we will need to submit a detailed plan in order to address this finding 
we intend to further explore this finding to assess its potential implications and prepare a plan for the fda 
while we intend to work diligently with the fda to resolve this issue  we cannot currently predict when the clinical hold will be released 
a clinical trial may also experience slow patient enrollment or lack of sufficient drug supplies 
patients may experience adverse medical events or side effects  and there may be a real or perceived lack of effectiveness of  or of safety issues associated with  the drug we are testing 
future governmental action or existing or changes in fda policies or precedents  may also result in delays or rejection of an application for marketing approval 
the fda has considerable discretion in determining whether to grant marketing approval for a drug  and may delay or deny approval even in circumstances where the applicant s clinical trials have proceeded in compliance with fda procedures and regulations and have met the established end points of the trials 
challenges to fda determinations are generally time consuming and costly  and rarely  if ever succeed 
in november  we received fda approval to market plenaxis in the united states 
we can give no assurance that we will obtain marketing approval for any of our other product candidates 
any regulatory approval may be conditioned upon significant labeling requirements and  as in the case of the fda approval of plenaxis  marketing restrictions and post marketing study commitments 
such labeling and marketing restrictions could materially adversely affect the marketability or value of a product  including plenaxis  resulting in decreased sales 
in such a case  we may have insufficient funds to continue operations as currently planned 
in addition  even after regulatory approval is obtained  our company  product and the manufacturing facilities for our product will be subject to continual review and periodic inspection 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product  the manufacturer or us  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
the fda stringently applies regulatory standards 
our manufacturing facilities will also be subject to fda inspections for adherence to good manufacturing practices prior to marketing clearance and periodically during the manufacturing process 
failure to comply can  among other things  result in fines  denial or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls or seizures  operating restrictions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
if there are any modifications to a product  further regulatory approval will be required 
for safety reasons  plenaxis was approved by the fda with a comprehensive risk management program 
this program includes educational outreach to patients and physicians regarding the risks and benefits of plenaxis  restricted distribution of the product only to physicians enrolled in a prescribing registry  a system for collecting and reporting adverse events to the fda and auditing requirements to evaluate the effectiveness of the program 
we are also required to conduct several phase iv studies to evaluate the risk management program and the appropriate use of the drug in the indicated population 
under the regulations under which plenaxis was approved  the fda has the authority to pre approve all promotional materials and has available to it an expedited market withdrawal procedure if issues arise regarding the safe use of plenaxis 
if approval for plenaxis is withdrawn  we will not be able to sell plenaxis and may have insufficient funds to continue operations as currently planned 
if we are unable to maintain fda approval  or to obtain any foreign regulatory approval for plenaxis  or to obtain or maintain regulatory approval to market our other potential products  we may exhaust our available resources significantly sooner than we had planned 
if this were to happen  we would need to either raise additional funds or seek partners to continue our currently planned research and development programs 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to raise the necessary funds or negotiate additional corporate collaborations on acceptable terms  if at all 
we rely upon a limited number of pharmaceutical specialty distributors that could impact the ability to sell plenaxis 
in the united states  we rely upon a limited number of specialty distributors to deliver plenaxis to physicians and hospital pharmacies 
there are a relatively small number of specialty distributors and wholesalers who provide such services 
these distributors must also distribute plenaxis only to physicians and hospital pharmacists enrolled in our risk management program 
there can be no assurances that these distributors will adequately provide their services to either the end users or to the company 
because we depend on third parties to conduct laboratory testing and human clinical studies and assist us with regulatory compliance  we may encounter delays in product development and commercialization 
we have contracts with a limited number of research organizations to design and conduct our laboratory testing and human clinical studies 
if we cannot contract for testing activities on acceptable terms  or at all  we may not complete our product development efforts in a timely manner 
to the extent we rely on third parties for laboratory testing and human clinical studies  we may lose some control over these activities 
for example  third parties may not complete testing activities on schedule or when we request them to do so 
in addition  these third parties may conduct our clinical trials in a manner inconsistent with regulatory requirements or otherwise in a manner that yields misleading or unreliable data 
this  or other failures of these third parties to carry out their duties  could result in significant additional costs and expenses and could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to develop and commercialize products that make our potential products and technologies obsolete or non competitive 
a biopharmaceutical company such as ours must keep pace with rapid technological change and faces intense competition 
we compete with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for funding  access to new technology  research personnel and in product research and development 
many of these companies have greater financial resources and more experience than we do in developing drugs  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing  marketing and sales 
we also face competition from academic and research institutions and government agencies pursuing alternatives to our products and technologies 
we expect that plenaxis  and all of our products under development  will face intense competition from existing or future drugs and other medical treatments 
in addition  for each of our product candidates  we may face increasing competition from generic formulations or existing drugs whose active components are no longer covered by patents 
our competitors may successfully identify drug candidates or develop products earlier than we do  obtain approvals from the fda or foreign regulatory bodies more rapidly than we do  develop products that are more effective  have fewer side effects or cost less than our products  or successfully market and sell products that compete with our products 
the success of our competitors in any of these efforts would adversely affect our ability to promote plenaxis and to develop and commercialize our product candidates  and to ultimately attain and maintain profitability 
if we are unable to obtain and enforce valid patents  we could lose any competitive advantage we may have 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our technologies and potential products 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode any competitive advantage we may have 
for example  if we lose our patent protection for plenaxis  another party could produce and market the compound in direct competition with us 
some foreign countries lack rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights and do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the united states 
many companies have had difficulty protecting their proprietary rights in foreign countries 
patent positions are sometimes uncertain and usually involve complex legal and factual questions 
we can protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we currently own or have exclusively licensed issued united states patents 
we have applied  and will continue to apply  for patents covering both our technologies and products as we deem appropriate 
others may challenge our patent applications or our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
moreover  any issued patents on our own inventions  or those licensed from third parties  may not provide us with adequate protection  or others may challenge the validity of  or seek to narrow or circumvent  these patents 
third party patents may impair or block our ability to conduct our business 
additionally  third parties may independently develop products similar to our products  duplicate our unpatented products  or design around any patented products we develop 
if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  we could lose any competitive advantage we may have 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  confidentiality  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions  and security measures to protect our confidential and proprietary information 
these measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
if these measures do not adequately protect our rights  third parties could use our technology  and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have 
in addition  others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques  which could impair any competitive advantage we may have 
if our technologies  processes or products conflict with the patents or other intellectual property rights of competitors  universities or others  we could have to engage in costly litigation and be unable to commercialize those products 
our technologies  processes  product or product candidates may give rise to claims that they infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
a third party could force us to pay damages  stop our use of these technologies or processes  or stop our manufacturing or marketing of the affected products by bringing a legal action against us for infringement 
in addition  we could be required to obtain a license to continue to use the technologies or processes or to manufacture or market the affected products  and we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms or at all 
we believe that significant litigation will continue in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in litigation  it could consume a substantial portion of our resources 
even if legal actions were meritless  defending a lawsuit could take significant time  be expensive and divert management s attention from other business concerns 
if third parties terminate our licenses  we could experience delays or be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our potential products 
we license some of our technology from third parties 
termination of our licenses could force us to delay or discontinue some of our development and commercialization programs 
for example  if advanced research and technology institute  inc  the assignee of indiana university foundation  terminated our license with them  we could have to discontinue the commercialization of plenaxis 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to license substitute technology in the future 
our inability to do so could impair our ability to conduct our business because we may lack the technology  or the necessary rights to technology  required to develop and commercialize our potential products 
we may have substantial exposure to product liability claims and may not have adequate insurance to cover those claims 
the administration of drugs to humans  whether in clinical trials or commercially  can result in product liability claims whether or not the drugs are actually at fault for causing an injury 
as plenaxis is used more widely  the likelihood of an adverse drug reaction both expected or unexpected or unintended side effect will increase 
furthermore  plenaxis or our product candidates may cause  or may appear to have caused  adverse side effects including death or potentially dangerous drug interactions that we may not learn about or understand fully until the drug has been administered to patients for some time 
product liability claims can be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments or settlements against us  which could have a negative effect on our financial performance 
the costs of product liability insurance have increased dramatically in recent years  and the availability of coverage has decreased 
although the company carries insurance that it regards as reasonably adequate to protect it from potential claims  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its current product liability insurance at a reasonable cost  or at all 
our collaboration agreements with amgen and sanofi synth labo included  and the agreements with them regarding the termination of those collaborations also include  an indemnification of them for liabilities associated with the development and commercialization of plenaxis 
if a third party  including a former collaborator  successfully sues us for any injury  or for indemnification for losses  there is no guarantee that the amount of the claim would not exceed the limit of the company s insurance coverage 
further  a successful claim could result in the recall of plenaxis  or could reduce revenues from sales of plenaxis 
even if a product liability claim is not successful  the adverse publicity and time and expense of defending such a claim may interfere with our business 
pharmaceutical companies have been the target of lawsuits and investigations and there is no assurance that if we were to be involved in any such lawsuits or investigation  that our defense would be successful 
pharmaceutical companies have been the target of lawsuits and investigations including  in particular  claims asserting violations of the federal false claim act  anti kickback act  the prescription drug marketing act or other violations in connection with medicare and or medicaid reimbursement  and claims under state laws  including state anti kickback and fraud laws 
public companies may also be the subject of certain other types of claims  including those asserting violations of securities laws or related to environmental matters 
there is no assurance that if we were to be involved in any such lawsuits or investigation  that we would be successful in defending ourselves or in asserting our rights 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional skilled personnel  we may be unable to pursue our product development and commercialization efforts 
we depend substantially on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  including malcolm l 
gefter  phd  our chief executive officer and chairman of the board  and william k 
heiden  our president and chief operating officer 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time and work for one of our competitors 
the loss of these key individuals could result in competitive harm because we could experience delays in our product research  development and commercialization efforts without their expertise 
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform future research and development work also will be critical to our success 
competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high 
we compete with numerous companies and academic and other research institutions for experienced scientists 
this competition may limit our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms 
failure to attract and retain qualified personnel would prevent us from continuing to develop our potential products  enhancing our technologies and launching our products commercially 
our planned activities will require the addition of new personnel  including management and marketing and sales personnel  and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel  in particular in the area of product marketing and sales 
the inability to attract and retain these people or to develop this expertise could prevent  or result in delays in  the marketing and sale of plenaxis or the research  development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business and any claims relating to the handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials  which may pose health risks 
for example  the health risks associated with accidental exposure to plenaxis include temporary impotence or infertility and harmful effects on pregnant women 
our operations also produce hazardous waste products 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge from hazardous materials and any resultant injury 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials 
compliance with health and safety and environmental laws and regulations is necessary and expensive 
current or future health and safety and environmental regulations may impair our research  development or production efforts 
we may be required to pay fines  penalties or damages in the event of noncompliance or the exposure of individuals to hazardous materials 
from time to time  third parties have also worked with hazardous materials in connection with our agreements with them 
we have agreed to indemnify our present and former collaborators in some circumstances against damages and other liabilities arising out of development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations 
the market price of our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to our ability to successfully commercialize plenaxis in the united states  failure or delay by third party manufacturers in performing their supply obligations or disputes or litigation regarding those obligations  the availability of reimbursement coverage for plenaxis and changes in the reimbursement policies of third party insurance companies or government agencies  our ability to enter into foreign corporate collaborations for plenaxis  or united states or foreign corporate collaborations for our other product candidates  and the timing and terms of such collaborations  the success rate of our discovery efforts and clinical trials  announcement of fda approval or disapproval of any of our product candidates  or of associated labeling requirements  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights  including claims of infringement  interference or litigation against us or our licensors  announcements concerning our competitors  or the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry in general  public concerns as to the safety of plenaxis or our competitors products  changes in government regulation of the pharmaceutical or medical industry  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  sales of large blocks of our common stock  changes in accounting principles  and the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of biotechnology companies  particularly companies like ours without current product revenues and earnings  have been highly volatile  and may continue to be highly volatile in the future 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities 
whether or not meritorious  litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
we expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate  and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include expected or unexpected fluctuations in plenaxis revenues  the timing and level of expenses related to the commercialization of plenaxis  the timing and level of expenses related to our other research and clinical development programs  and the timing of our commercialization of other products resulting in revenues 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
if we engage in an acquisition  we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
if appropriate opportunities become available  we may attempt to acquire businesses  or acquire or in license products or technologies  that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
we currently have no commitments or agreements for any acquisitions 
if we do undertake any transaction of this sort  the process of integrating an acquired business  or an acquired or in licensed product or technology  may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction of this sort 
to the extent we issue stock in a transaction  the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted 
transactions of this kind could also cause us to incur debt  expose us to future liabilities and result in expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
anti takeover provisions in our charter and by laws  our rights agreement and certain provisions of delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management 
also  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which may prohibit or delay large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
in addition  the rights issued under our rights agreement may be a substantial deterrent to a person acquiring or more of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors 
these provisions in our charter and by laws  rights agreement and under delaware law could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
we have not entered into any instruments for trading purposes 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that an increase in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to decrease 
to minimize this risk in the future  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
an immediate hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  the same hypothetical increase in interest rates as of december  would have resulted in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments 
due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
as of december   approximately of our total portfolio will mature in one year or less  with the remainder maturing in less than three years 
in connection with the purchase of our new facility in july  our wholly owned real estate subsidiary executed an acquisition and construction loan agreement that provides for up to million in borrowings at a floating interest rate indexed to day libor 
concurrent with that transaction  the subsidiary also entered into an interest rate cap agreement which limits exposure to interest rate increases above a certain threshold 
due to the decrease in interest rates since we entered into this interest rate cap  we currently do not believe that there is material interest rate risk exposure with respect to the loan agreement 
in addition  we believe that we have mitigated our risk relating to significant adverse fluctuations in interest rates with respect to borrowings under the loan agreement  and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
