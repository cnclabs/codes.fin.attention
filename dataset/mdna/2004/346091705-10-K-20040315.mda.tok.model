item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this form k 
regulation our oil and gas operations are subject to various us federal  state and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations 
united states 
various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are regulated by administrative agencies under statutory provisions of the states where such operations are conducted and by certain agencies of the federal government for operations on federal leases 
all of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing crude oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas  including provisions requiring permits for the drilling of wells and maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and provisions relating to the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the abandonment of wells 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the number of wells which may be drilled in an area and the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties 
in this regard  some states can order the pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas  and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the natural gas act of nga and the natural gas policy act of ngpa 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which oil and gas could be sold 
the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of the decontrol act removed all nga and ngpa price and nonprice controls affecting producers wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  while sales by producers of natural gas  and all sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices  congress could enact price controls in the future 
commencing in  the ferc issued order no 
and subsequent orders collectively  order no 
 which require interstate pipelines to provide transportation services separate from the pipelines sales of gas 
also  order no 
requires pipelines to provide open access transportation on a basis that is equal for all gas supplies 
the courts have largely affirmed the significant features of order no 
and numerous related orders pertaining to the individual pipelines  although certain appeals remain pending and the ferc continues to review and modify its open access regulations 
commencing in february  the ferc issued order no 
and subsequent orders collectively  order no 
 which imposed a number of reforms intended to further enhance competition in natural gas markets 
most major aspects of order no 
were upheld in judicial review  though certain issues were remanded to ferc  have been considered on remand  and are pending rehearing at ferc 
while any additional ferc action on these matters would affect forest only indirectly  these changes are intended to further enhance competition in natural gas markets 
we cannot predict whether and to what extent the ferc s regulations will survive rehearing and further judicial review and  if so  whether the ferc s actions will achieve the goal of increasing competition in natural gas markets in which our natural gas is sold 
however  we do not believe that we will be affected materially differently than other natural gas producers and markets with which and in which we compete 
the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf the ocs provide open access  non discriminatory service 
commencing in april  ferc issued order no 
and subsequent orders collectively  order no 
 which imposed certain reporting requirements applicable to gas service providers operating on the ocs concerning their prices and other terms and conditions of service 
the purpose of order no 
is to provide regulators and other interested parties with sufficient information to detect and to remedy discriminatory conduct by such service providers 
ferc has stated that these reporting rules apply to ocs gatherers and has clarified that they may also apply to other ocs service providers including platform operators performing dehydration  compression  processing and related services for third parties 
the us district court overturned the ferc s reporting rules as exceeding its authority under ocsla 
the ferc has recently appealed this decision  which was affirmed on appeal through petitions to the us supreme court and are pending 
we cannot predict whether and to what extent these regulations might be reinstated  and what effect  if any  they may have on our financial condition or operations 
the rules  if reinstated  may increase the frequency of claims of discriminatory service  may decrease competition among ocs service providers and may lessen the willingness of ocs gathering companies to provide service on a discounted basis 
certain operations that we conduct are on federal oil and gas leases  which are administered by the bureau of land management blm and the minerals management service mms 
these leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed blm and mms regulations and orders pursuant to the ocsla which are subject to change by the mms 
many onshore leases contain stipulations limiting activities that may be conducted on the lease 
the stipulations are unique to particular geographic areas and may limit the times during which activities on the lease may be conducted  the manner in which certain activities may be conducted or  in some cases  may ban any surface activity 
for offshore operations  lessees must obtain mms approval for exploration  development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations 
in addition to permits required from other agencies such as the environmental protection agency  lessees must obtain a permit from the blm or the mms  as applicable  prior to the commencement of drilling 
lessees must also comply with detailed blm or mms regulations  as applicable  governing  among other things  engineering and construction specifications for production facilities  safety procedures  plugging and abandonment of ocs wells  calculation of royalty payments and the valuation of production for this purpose and removal of facilities 
to cover the various obligations of lessees on the ocs  the mms generally requires that lessees post substantial bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met  unless the mms exempts the lessee from such obligations 
the cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and we can provide no assurance that we can continue to obtain bonds or other surety in all cases 
under certain circumstances  the blm or mms  as applicable  may require our operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
in march  the mms issued a final rule modifying the valuation procedures for the calculation of royalties owed for crude oil sales 
when oil production sales are not in arms length transactions  the new royalty calculation will base the valuation of oil production on spot market prices instead of the posted prices that were previously utilized 
we do not believe that this rule will have a material adverse effect on our operations 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by congress  states  the ferc and the courts 
we cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 
in the past  the natural gas industry has been heavily regulated 
we can give no assurance that the regulatory approach currently pursued by the ferc will continue indefinitely 
we do not anticipate  however  that compliance with existing federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations will have a material or significantly adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
no material portion of forest s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the federal government 
canada 
the oil and natural gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government 
it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect our operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size 
we are unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be created 
oil and natural gas exported from canada is subject to regulation by the national energy board neb  an independent federal regulatory agency and the government of canada 
exporters are free to negotiate with purchasers  provided that the export contracts must meet certain criteria prescribed by the neb 
natural gas exports for a term of less than two years or for a term two to years in quantities of more than  cubic meters per day  must be made pursuant to a neb order 
oil exports may be made pursuant to export contracts with terms not exceeding one year  in the case of light crude  and not exceeding two years  in the case of heavy crude  provided that an order approving any export has been obtained from the neb 
any natural gas or oil export to be made pursuant to a contract of longer duration to a maximum of years or a larger quantity requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the neb and the government of canada 
the provinces in which our operations are located  mainly alberta and british columbia  also regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed for consumption elsewhere 
in addition  each province has regulations that govern land tenure  royalties  production rates and other matters 
the royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production 
royalties payable on production from private lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee  although production from such lands is also subject to certain provincial taxes and royalties 
crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production  and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices  well productivity  geographical location  field discovery date and the type or quality of the petroleum product produced 
in alberta  certain producers of oil or natural gas are entitled to a credit against the royalties to the crown by virtue of the artc alberta royalty tax credit program 
the credit is determined by applying a specified rate to a maximum of million cdn of alberta crown royalties payable for each producer 
canadian forest is eligible for artc credits only on eligible properties acquired and wells drilled after the change of control that occurred when canadian forest was acquired by forest 
production from properties acquired from corporations claiming maximum entitlement to artc will generally not be eligible 
in british columbia  the amount payable as a royalty in respect of oil depends on the vintage of the oil  the quantity of oil produced and the value of the oil 
oil produced from newly discovered pools may be exempt from the payment of a royalty for the first months of production 
the royalty payable on natural gas is determined by a sliding scale based on the greater of the amount obtained by the producer and a prescribed minimum price 
the minimum royalty for natural gas produced in association with oil is and for other natural gas is 
the federal government has jurisdiction over the exploration and development of oil and gas resources in the northwest territories of canada 
the federal regulatory regime reflects the extended timelines and increased capital expenditures inherent in working in the northern environment  providing for work commitments and work deposits coupled with the suspension and or reimbursement of rentals and royalties at earlier developmental stages 
this regime is subject to change as development in the northwest territories evolves toward a more conventional model 
it is also possible that jurisdiction over the oil and gas resources in these territories could be transferred to the territorial governments 
we are unable to predict whether any evolution or transfer of jurisdiction to the territorial governments would affect our activities in the northwest territories 
our right to produce oil and gas from the northwest territories is subject to conversion of certain instruments ie  exploration licenses or significant discovery licenses into production licenses 
the right to such conversion is subject to an application process and regulatory approval 
in addition  the right to produce may be dependent on the negotiation of a pooling agreement or the imposition of a forced pooling order 
until the finalization of such agreement or order  it is not possible to finally determine our production in such lands 
environmental matters 
extensive us federal  state and local laws  as well as laws of foreign countries  govern oil and natural gas operations  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to environmental protection 
numerous governmental agencies  such as the us environmental protection agency commonly called the epa  issue regulations to implement and enforce such laws 
environmental laws and regulations are often difficult and costly to comply with and substantial administrative  civil and even criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply 
these laws and regulations may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering an owner or lessee liable for environmental and natural resource damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the owner or lessee 
this regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability 
changes in existing environmental laws or the adoption of new environmental laws have the potential to adversely affect our operations or earnings  as well as the oil and gas exploration and production industry in general 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us  we cannot give any assurance that we will not be adversely affected in the future 
the oil pollution act of opa and regulations thereunder impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in us waters 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of a pipeline  vessel or onshore facility  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages from oil spills 
opa also requires operators of offshore ocs facilities to demonstrate to the mms that they possess at least million in financial resources that are available to pay for costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill 
this financial responsibility amount can increase up to a maximum of million if the mms determines that a greater amount is justified based on specific risks posed by the operations or if the worst case oil spill discharge volume possible at a facility exceeds applicable threshold volumes established by the mms 
while liability limits apply in some circumstances  a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operating regulation 
if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup  liability limits likewise do not apply 
even if applicable  the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs  plus up to million in other damages  while the liability limits for onshore facilities are million 
few defenses exist to the liability imposed by opa 
the us federal water pollution control act commonly called the clean water act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other oil and gas wastes in waters of the united states  a broadly defined term that includes all navigable waters 
many state discharge regulations and the federal national pollutant discharge elimination system generally prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand  drilling fluids  drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and gas industry into coastal waters 
although the costs to comply with these zero discharge mandates under federal or state law may be significant  the entire industry is expected to experience similar costs and we believe that these costs will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operations 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended commonly called cercla but also known as superfund and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the current owner and operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances that have been released at the site 
persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under cercla may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment 
in the ordinary course of forest s operations  substances may be generated that fall within the definition of hazardous substances 
although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  wastes associated with oil and gas exploration and production operations may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
moreover  we may own or operate properties that in the past were operated by third parties whose operations were not under our control 
those properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to cercla  and analogous state laws  and we potentially could be required to remediate such properties 
in canada  the oil and natural gas industry is currently subject to environmental regulation pursuant to provincial and federal legislation that provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized with oil and gas industry operations 
in addition  wells and facility sites must be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities 
compliance with such legislation can require significant expenditures 
a breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties  the revocation of licenses and authorizations or civil liability for pollution damage 
although we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above  including insuring the costs of clean up operations  public liability and physical damage  there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to fully cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future or that such insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase 
the occurrence of a significant environmental related event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
we have established guidelines to be followed to comply with us and canadian environmental laws and regulations 
we employ an environmental department whose responsibilities include providing assurance that our operations are carried out in accordance with applicable environmental guidelines and safety precautions 
although we maintain pollution insurance against the costs of clean up operations  public liability and physical damage  there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future 
in addition  any oil and gas activities conducted by us outside of north america are potentially subject to similar foreign governmental controls and restrictions pertaining to the environment 
to date we believe that compliance with existing requirements of such governmental bodies has not had a material effect on our operations 
we believe that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue toward stricter standards 
we are committed to meeting our responsibilities to protect the environment wherever we operate and anticipate making increased expenditures as a result of increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment

the financial results of our foreign operations are also subject to currency exchange rate risks 
reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data  the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by our reservoir engineers 
in addition  the results of drilling  testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously 
if significant  such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling

see also part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors estimates of oil and gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise  for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves 
since january  we have not filed any oil or natural gas reserve estimates or included any such estimates in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency  other than the securities and exchange commission sec and the department of energy doe 
there were no differences between the reserve estimates included in the sec report  the doe report and those included herein  except for production and additions and deletions due to the difference in the as of dates of such reserve estimates 
forest s estimated proved reserves were  bcfe at december  compared to estimated proved reserves of  bcfe at december  approximately of our estimated proved reserves at december  were natural gas and our estimated proved developed reserves represented approximately of total estimated proved reserves 
forest s year end estimates of proved reserves were independently reviewed by two independent petroleum engineering firms 
ryder scott company independently reviewed our estimates of the reserves attributable to certain properties in the united states and canada  except the properties acquired by us on december  in the permian basin and south texas  which were independently reviewed by degolyer and macnaughton 
in conducting an independent review of forest s estimates of proved reserves each petroleum engineering firm prepared independent estimates of reserves for specific fields 
the estimates prepared by each petroleum engineering firm were presented to forest by field for oil  gas and natural gas liquids 
the estimates prepared by the engineering firms were then compared to the estimates prepared by forest in the aggregate on a gas equivalent basis 
together  these firms independently reviewed estimates relating to properties constituting approximately of our reserves based on their discounted value and volumes 
in the aggregate  for the properties reviewed  the estimates of proved reserve quantities prepared by the two independent petroleum engineering firms as part of their reviews were lower than forest s estimates by approximately 
upon consummation of their reviews  ryder scott company and degolyer and macnaughton each provided forest with their opinions that forest s estimates of proved reserves for the properties reviewed by them complied with the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the sec 
reserve revisions 
during we revised downward our estimate of proved reserves by a total of approximately bcfe 
the downward revision of our estimates was due to information received from production results  drilling activity and other events that occurred primarily in the latter part of the revisions are not expected to have a material impact on our near term hydrocarbon production volumes 
approximately of the total revisions was attributable to the downward revision of our estimate of proved oil reserves in the redoubt shoal field in the cook inlet  alaska 
we reduced our estimate of proved oil reserves associated with our redoubt shoal field in alaska from our year end estimate by approximately million barrels  or approximately of the estimated proved oil reserves of this field as of december  of this revision  approximately million barrels were classified as proved undeveloped as of december  our estimate of proved oil reserves attributable to the redoubt shoal field was approximately million barrels as of december  on december   forest s net daily oil production at the redoubt shoal field was approximately  barrels per day from three wells 
on that date one well was shut in for pump repair 
production results in from redoubt shoal  which began production in december  were lower than those originally estimated 
in addition  data from wells drilled in in redoubt shoal  when integrated with pre existing data  reflected significantly lower oil in place than the estimates at december   lower overall recovery efficiencies and economic cutoffs 
during the second half of forest undertook an integrated field study of the redoubt shoal field examining the production performance  field data and well data for activity 
the revision was a result of the study  after applying economic cutoffs 
in addition to preparing and reporting its own internal estimates of proved reserves at redoubt shoal  forest also engaged ryder scott company to prepare independent estimates of proved reserves at redoubt shoal as of the end of  and cumulative investment in exploration  delineation and development of the redoubt shoal field by forest and its predecessor  forcenergy inc forcenergy  through december  was approximately million 
as of december   we estimated total future development capital expenditures  excluding abandonment  for the redoubt shoal field to be approximately million 
this amount includes the remaining cost of implementing the water injection project described below 
forest s future development plans for the redoubt shoal field currently include the implementation of a water injection project for the purpose of maintaining the average hemlock reservoir pressure  conserving the natural energy of the reservoir and assisting oil recovery 
implementation of the water injection project is currently planned to begin within the next two years 
our current plans call for the drilling of two oil wells and one water injection well and the conversion of three wells from production to water injection  over several years 
we also had downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves for other properties in the fourth quarter of totaling approximately bcfe 
these revisions were in addition to bcfe of downward revisions to estimated proved reserves taken previously in these downward revisions are due to a variety of factors  including recent production performance and revised field development plans

delivery commitments a significant portion of canadian forest s natural gas production in was sold through the canadian netback pool which was administered by promark on behalf of canadian forest 
the gas marketing business of promark was sold to cinergy on march  canadian forest will continue to sell a significant portion of its natural gas production into the canadian netback pool  which cinergy will administer pursuant to a contract administration agreement 
also  under our agreement with cinergy  canadian forest will sell and cinergy will purchase for a period of five years all of canadian forest s natural gas that is not otherwise subject to the canadian netback pool or existing contracts 
cinergy will pay for the natural gas based on published indices less applicable transportation costs

in order to satisfy its supply obligations to the canadian netback pool  canadian forest may be required to cover its obligations in the market 
the administrator of the canadian netback pool  now cinergy  is required to acquire gas in the event of a shortfall between the gas supply and market obligations 
a shortfall could occur if a gas producer fails to deliver its contractual share of the supply obligations of the canadian netback pool 
the cost of purchasing gas to cover any shortfall is a cost of the canadian netback pool 
the prices paid for shortfall gas would typically be spot market prices and may differ from the prices received from customers of the canadian netback pool 
higher spot prices would reduce the average price paid to the gas producers in the canadian netback pool  including canadian forest

while we believe that the amount of any potential loss would not be material to our consolidated financial position  the ultimate outcome of these matters is inherently difficult to predict with any certainty 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome  the potential loss could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow in the reporting periods in which any such actions are resolved 
alaska proceeding 
in may   cook inlet keeper  a non governmental third party  filed a challenge in the superior court in anchorage  alaska the trial court to the regulatory review and approval process for forest s development and production phase of our redoubt shoal project the production project 
on february   the trial court ruled that certain legislation which became law in mooted cook inlet keeper s challenge and  therefore  affirmed the state s approval of the production project 
while we will continue our vigorous opposition to cook inlet keeper s challenge  the outcome of the litigation is inherently difficult to predict with any certainty 
however  the company does not believe that this legal matter could have a material effect on the results of future periods in the event of an unfavorable outcome

forest owns and operates a platform located in the cook inlet  alaska 
discharges from the platform have on occasion exceeded the limits allowed by the epa discharge permit 
forest recently received permission from the state of alaska to inject the effluent into a disposal well rather than discharge it into the cook inlet 
forest also owns a non operating working interest in the king salmon platform in the cook inlet in alaska 
in september  while injecting oil based drilling mud and cuttings into the annulus of the well  the operator observed an oil sheen on the water near the platform and ceased further injections 
the us coast guard initiated an enforcement action based on the apparent discharges into the cook inlet 
in addition  the state of alaska department of environmental conservation has indicated that it may also initiate an enforcement action 
in addition  forest received a findings of violation for alleged violations of the clean water act involving discharges from to from facilities in the gulf of mexico that were previously operated by forcenergy 
all alleged violations have been remedied

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with forest s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of natural gas and liquids in north america and selected international locations 
was a year mixed with successes and significant disappointments and a year in which we changed our corporate leadership and strategies 
highlights the successes included better production performance bcfe in vs 
bcfe in significantly higher revenue primarily as a result of higher production and oil and gas prices  lower lease operating expenses million lower in than despite a million increase in production and ad valorem taxes  significantly higher net income resulting from higher production  higher realized oil and gas prices and lower expenses  continued drilling success on deep shelf prospects in the gulf of mexico  and acquisitions totaling bcfe of estimated proved reserves in properties located in the gulf of mexico  gulf coast  south texas and the permian basin 
these properties were acquired for a total of million net of taxes or per mcfe and will add to our production in despite these successes  we experienced disappointing production performance and drilling results in a number of areas  the most significant of which was the redoubt shoal field in the cook inlet of alaska 
the total downward revisions of estimated proved reserves taken in was bcfe  of which approximately was attributable to a downward revision of our estimated proved oil reserves at redoubt shoal field 
proved reserves were  bcfe at year end  a year over year reduction of approximately 
see reserve revisions below 
in we also experienced a leadership change and revised our strategies 
in the third quarter of  we named a new chief executive officer and split the ceo and chairman of the board positions  also naming a new non executive chairman 
our new leadership revised our strategies late in the third quarter 
we established a four point plan to achieve increased value for our investors  consisting of a focus on cost control  reduced exposure to frontier exploration in favor of lower risk exploitation  pursuit of asset acquisitions as an integral part of our investment program  and a focus on our financial strength to fund growth 
we implemented our plan in the fourth quarter and acquired bcfe of proved reserves in that quarter 
these acquisitions now make up almost of our proved reserve base 
one of these strategies  the focus on our financial strength to fund growth  could be a distinct challenge 
over time  we would like to achieve a debt capitalization percentage of 
as of december  our debt capitalization percentage was 
when appropriate  we intend to access capital markets  including equity markets  to finance larger acquisitions and help us achieve our debt capitalization goals 
reserve revisions during we revised downward our estimates of proved reserves by a total of approximately bcfe 
the downward revision of our estimates was due to information received from production results  drilling activity and other events that occurred primarily in the latter part of the revisions are not expected to have a material impact on our near term hydrocarbon production volumes 
approximately of the total revisions was attributable to the downward revision of our estimate of proved oil reserves in the redoubt shoal field in the cook inlet  alaska 
we reduced our estimate of proved oil reserves associated with our redoubt shoal field in alaska from our year end estimate by approximately million barrels  or approximately of the estimated proved oil reserves of this field as of december  of this revision  approximately million barrels were classified as proved undeveloped as of december  our estimate of proved oil reserves attributable to the redoubt shoal field was approximately million barrels as of december  cumulative investment in exploration  delineation and development of the redoubt shoal field by forest and its predecessor  forcenergy  through december  was approximately million 
as of december   we estimated total future development capital expenditures  excluding abandonment  for the redoubt shoal field to be approximately million 
we also had downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves for other properties in the fourth quarter of totaling approximately bcfe 
these revisions were in addition to bcfe of downward revisions to estimated proved reserves taken previously in these downward revisions are due to a variety of factors  including recent production performance and revised field development plans 
as a result of the revisions our global borrowing base under our credit facilities was reduced from million at december  to million at march  the rating agencies may downgrade our credit rating 
in february  following announcement of our downward reserve revisions  forest was placed on credit watch by both rating agencies 
a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of amounts borrowed under our credit facility and could increase the cost and or reduce the availability of any additional long term debt 
there could be an increase in the cost or amount of credit support insurance  letters of credit  bonds required by our counterparties 
we could also be required to agree to stricter debt covenants that would restrict our operating flexibility 
we do not believe that the revisions to our estimates of proved reserves or the effects on our liquidity or financial condition will create an event of non compliance with any of our debt covenants 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
as a result of the revisions  we are subject to writedowns of our us and canadian full cost pools under ceiling test limitations pursuant to full cost accounting at higher commodity price thresholds than we were prior to the revisions 
if we were to record writedowns  shareholders equity could be reduced significantly 
outlook in executing our plan in  we face a number of uncertainties and challenges 
first  while we hedge the price risk for a portion of our production  oil and gas prices  which have a significant impact on our cash flow remain volatile and uncertain 
also  net income will be adversely impacted by the higher depletion expense resulting from our downward revisions to our estimate of proved reserves in while we believe that there will be a large number of oil and gas acquisition opportunities in and that we have the skills to make sound acquisitions  we also believe that the competition for these opportunities will be significant 
in addition  we have made and will make changes in to our organization to enhance productivity 
while we believe that these changes  over time  will improve our performance  they could  in the short run  negatively impact performance 
the borrowing base under our bank facility has been reduced due to the downward revision of our estimates of proved reserves in we believe  however  that we have adequate liquidity to accomplish our exploration and development spending plan and to also make a meaningful amount of oil and gas property acquisitions 
forest s anticipated expenditures for exploration and development in are estimated to range from million to million 
overall  our outlook for is a positive one 
we have changed our direction with four key strategies 
the execution of tactics to accomplish these strategies is well underway 
we made two sizeable acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and we are actively pursuing others 
we will reduce frontier exploration spending  and we plan to pursue some high impact exploration spending 
we will continue to emphasize cost control in all areas  including general and administrative costs 
if the current favorable oil and gas price environment continues  we expect to generate cash flow in in excess of our expected capital expenditures 
in summary  we will continue to take the necessary actions to accomplish our overall objective to enhance shareholder value and to seek prudent growth 
results of operations net earnings for were million compared to net earnings of million in the increase in earnings was due primarily to the combination of higher average oil and gas sales prices  higher sales volumes  and lower oil and gas production expense 
net earnings for were million compared to net earnings of million in the decrease in earnings was the result of lower sales volumes and lower average oil and gas sales prices  offset partially by lower operating expenses 
lower sales volumes were primarily the result of property sales in the fourth quarter of  hurricane downtime in the gulf of mexico in and normal declines caused by reduced capital expenditures 
oil and gas sales sales volumes  weighted average sales prices  and oil and gas sales revenue for the years ended december   and were as follows years ended december  change change natural gas sales volumes mmcf united states    canada    total    sales price received per mcf effects of energy swaps and collars per mcf

hedged natural gas volumes were  mmcf   mmcf and  mmcf in  and  respectively 
hedged oil and condensate volumes were  barrels   barrels  and  barrels in  and  respectively 
these arrangements have been designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and  as a result  the effective portion of the net gains and losses were accounted for as increases and decreases of oil and gas sales 
the aggregate net gains losses related to our cash flow hedges were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
those arrangements that are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes are recorded as non operating income or expense 
average sales prices have been adjusted to reflect effects of energy swaps and collars 
the increase in oil and gas sales revenue in compared to was the result of increased price realizations for both oil and gas  combined with higher sales volumes 
in the united states  increases in our sales volumes were attributable primarily to acquisitions made during in canada  our sales volumes decreased in due primarily to higher royalty volumes in the current higher price environment  plant maintenance and the effects of property divestitures in the decrease in oil and gas sales revenue in compared to was primarily the result of lower product prices and production volumes 
volume decreases were due primarily to the gulf coast business unit 
our gulf of mexico properties were impacted by the sale of of forest s interests in the south marsh island and vermilion areas in the fourth quarter of  and also experienced hurricane downtime and normal production declines that were the result of reduced capital expenditures 
oil and gas production expense the components of oil and gas production expense for the years ended december   and were as follows years ended december  change change in thousands direct operating expense and workovers   product transportation    production and ad valorem taxes    total oil and gas production expense   oil and gas production expense per mcfe oil and gas production expense includes direct costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities  costs of expensed workovers  product transportation costs from the wellhead to the sales point and production and ad valorem taxes 
the reduction in compared to  on both an absolute and a per unit basis  reflects cost reduction measures employed throughout forest s operations  offset somewhat by increases in production and ad valorem taxes that were the direct result of higher product sales prices 
the decrease in production expense in compared to was due primarily to lower direct operating expense 
general and administrative expense  overhead the following table summarizes the components of total overhead costs incurred during the periods years ended december  change change in thousands overhead costs capitalized    general and administrative costs expensed   total overhead costs    number of salaried employees at end of year the decrease in overhead costs in resulted primarily from cost reduction measures in corporate areas and from higher fixed rate overhead recoveries 
cost reductions were achieved despite the inclusion of approximately million attributable to severance costs and termination of the canadian defined benefit pension plan 
the increase in compared to was attributable primarily to increases in employee related expenses  legal expense and insurance expense  lower fixed rate overhead cost recoveries for production operations as a result of the gulf of mexico property sale and the related change in operatorship of those properties  and lower fixed rate overhead cost recoveries for drilling activities due to decreased capital spending in the period 
the percentage of overhead capitalized remained relatively constant  ranging between and for  and merger and seismic license costs merger and seismic licensing costs of million in included banking  legal  accounting  printing and other consulting costs related to the merger with forcenergy in december   including severance paid to terminated employees  office closures  employee relocation  data migration  systems integration and costs of transferring seismic licenses from forcenergy to forest 
depreciation and depletion  impairments depreciation and depletion expense for the years ended december   and was as follows years ended december  change change in thousands depreciation and depletion expense   depletion expense per mcfe the increase in depletion expense and the increase in the per unit depletion rate in compared to were due primarily to downward revisions in estimated proved reserves totaling approximately bcfe in these revisions  which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of  resulted in a fourth quarter depletion rate of per mcfe 
the decrease in depletion expense in compared to was attributable primarily to lower production volumes 
at december  of the years listed below forest had the following costs of undeveloped properties which were not subject to depletion united states canada international total in thousands in  forest recorded impairments of oil and gas properties located outside of north america of million million net of taxes  related primarily to evaluations of projects in albania  italy  romania  switzerland and tunisia 
of this amount  approximately million related to our interest in a project in albania 
no impairments were recorded in in  forest recorded impairments of oil and gas properties located outside north america of million million net of taxes 
of this amount  approximately million million net of taxes related to albania 
impairments were also recognized in other countries in based on expiration of certain concessions and evaluations of projects in those countries 
accretion of asset retirement obligation accretion expense of approximately million was related to the accretion of forest s asset retirement obligation pursuant to sfas no 
 adopted january  sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
using a cumulative effect approach  in the first quarter of forest recorded an increase to net property and equipment of approximately million net of tax  an asset retirement obligation liability of approximately million net of tax and an after tax credit of approximately million for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
other expense  net the components of other expense  net for the years ended december   and were as follows years ended december  in thousands loss on extinguishment of debt    franchise taxes    forest s share of income loss of equity method investee  foreign currency translation losses gains on subordinated debt realized and unrealized losses gains on derivative instruments write off of receivables due from enron for physical sales of natural gas other  total other expense    losses on extinguishment of debt relate to redemptions of our and our senior subordinated notes for amounts in excess of par value 
franchise taxes are paid to the states of texas and louisiana based on capital investment deployed in these states  determined by apportioning total capital as defined by law 
forest s share of income or loss of equity method investee relates to our ownership of a pipeline company that transports our crude oil in alaska 
foreign currency translation gains and losses relate to the translation of us dollar denominated notes issued by canadian forest 
all of the outstanding notes were redeemed in september interest expense interest expense of million in was lower than  primarily because the effects of higher average debt balances were more than offset by lower average interest rates on variable and fixed rate debt and by amortization of gains recognized on termination of interest rate swaps 
interest expense of million in was higher than due primarily to debt balances that were  on average  higher  offset partially by significantly lower interest rates on variable and fixed rate debt 
current and deferred income tax expense forest recorded current income tax expense of  in compared to  in and million in the increase in compared to was due primarily to changes in the federal alternative minimum tax and the exhaustion of certain state net operating losses 
the decrease in compared to was due primarily to decreases in pre tax profitability and reduced state tax provisions 
deferred income tax expense was million in compared to million in  and million in the increase in compared to was attributable to increased pre tax profitability and an increase in permanent tax differences  partially offset by a decrease in canadian taxes of  due to a canadian federal income tax rate reduction from to over a five year period beginning in the decrease in compared to was due primarily to lower pre tax profitability 
results of discontinued operations on march   the assets and business operations of our canadian marketing subsidiary  promark  were sold to cinergy for million cdn 
under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  cinergy will market natural gas on behalf of canadian forest for five years  unless subject to prior contractual commitments  and will also administer the netback pool formerly administered by promark 
we could receive additional contingent payments over the next five years if cinergy meets certain earnings goals with respect to the acquired business 
as a result of forest s fourth quarter decision to sell the gas marketing operations of promark  promark s results of operations have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all years presented 
the components of loss income from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and are as follows years ended december  in thousands marketing income  net    general and administrative expense    interest income expense other income  net depreciation   impairment of contract value  current income tax benefit expense deferred income tax expense  loss on sale of discontinued operations  liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to access cash 
we have historically addressed our long term liquidity requirements through the use of bank credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities as well as through the issuance of debt and equity securities  when market conditions permit 
the prices we receive for future oil and natural gas production and the level of production have significant impacts on operating cash flows 
we are unable to predict with any degree of certainty the prices we will receive for our future oil and gas production 
we continually examine alternative sources of long term capital  including bank borrowings  the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities  sales of non strategic assets  prospects and technical information and joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  our ability to execute our operating strategy will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in  we revised downward our estimates of proved reserves by bcfe 
as a result of the revisions our global borrowing base under our credit facilities was reduced from million at december  to million at march  the rating agencies may downgrade our credit rating 
a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of amounts borrowed under our credit facility and could increase the cost and or reduce the availability of any additional long term debt 
we could also be required to agree to stricter debt covenants that would restrict our operating flexibility 
there could be an increase in the cost or amount of credit support insurance  letters of credit  bonds required by our counterparties 
we do not believe that the revisions to our estimates of proved reserves or the effects on our liquidity or financial condition will create an event of non compliance with any of our debt covenants 
working capital 
working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
it is not unusual for forest to have deficits in working capital  exclusive of the effects of derivatives and abandonment liabilities  at the end of a period 
such working capital deficits are principally the result of accounts payable related to exploration and development costs 
settlement of these payables is funded by cash flow from operations or  if necessary  by drawdowns on bank credit facilities 
forest had a working capital deficit  exclusive of the after tax effects of derivatives and abandonment liabilities  of approximately million at december  compared to a corresponding deficit of approximately million at december  the change was due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable offset partially by an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in other current assets 
the increases in both accounts receivable and accounts payable are primarily attributable to revenue and joint interest operations resulting from higher product prices and recent acquisitions 
the decrease in current assets relates primarily to decreases in cash calls outstanding and prepaid taxes 
cash flow 
historically  one of our primary sources of capital has been net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities  net cash used by investing activities and net cash provided used by financing activities for the years ended december   and were as follows years ended december  change change in thousands net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used by investing activities   net cash provided used by financing activities   the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was due primarily to higher average oil and gas prices 
the increase in cash used by investing activities in was due primarily to the acquisition of certain oil and natural gas properties in october  and the purchase of of the stock of a private company on december  net cash provided by financing activities in included net bank borrowings of million and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of options and warrants of approximately million in the aggregate  partially offset by cash used for the redemption of the senior subordinated notes of million in the aggregate 
the period included net borrowings of bank debt of million  proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps of million and net proceeds of million from the issuance of the senior notes  offset by repurchases of the senior subordinated notes of million in the aggregate and repurchases and redemptions of the senior subordinated notes of million in the aggregate 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was due primarily to lower product prices and decreased production 
the decrease in cash used for investing activities in compared to was due primarily to decreased exploration and development activity in  offset partially by lower property sales in compared to net cash provided by financing activities in included net bank debt borrowings of million  proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps of million and net proceeds of million from the issuance of the senior notes  offset by repurchases of the senior subordinated notes of million and repurchases and redemptions of the senior subordinated notes of million in the aggregate 
the period included net repayments of bank debt of million  cash used for redemption of senior subordinated notes of million  cash used for the purchase of treasury stock of million  and net cash proceeds of million in the aggregate from the issuance of two series of senior notes 
capital expenditures 
expenditures for property acquisition  exploration and development were as follows years ended december  in thousands property acquisition costs proved properties   undeveloped properties  exploration costs direct costs    overhead capitalized    development costs direct costs    overhead capitalized    total capital expenditures for property development  acquisition and exploration    does not include estimated discounted asset retirement obligations of million related to assets placed in service during the year ended december  forest s anticipated expenditures for exploration and development in are estimated to range from million to million 
we intend to meet our capital expenditure financing requirements using cash flows generated by operations  sales of assets and  if necessary  borrowings under bank credit facilities 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will have access to sufficient capital to meet these capital requirements 
the planned levels of capital expenditures could be reduced if we experience lower than anticipated net cash provided by operations or develop other needs for liquidity  or could be increased if we experience increased cash flow or access additional sources of capital 
in addition  while we intend to continue a strategy of acquiring reserves that meet our investment criteria  no assurance can be given that we can locate or finance any property acquisitions 
bank credit facilities 
we have credit facilities totaling million  consisting of a million us credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase and a million canadian credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  toronto branch 
the credit facilities mature in october in october  we amended the credit facilities to allow us the option of electing to have availability under the credit facilities governed by a borrowing base global borrowing base  rather than financial covenants 
we can exercise the option one time per year and any such election will be irrevocable for a period of one year 
the determination of the global borrowing base is made by the lenders taking into consideration the estimated value of our oil and gas properties in accordance with the lenders customary practices for oil and gas loans 
effective october   we elected to determine availability based on the global borrowing base 
under the global borrowing base  availability will be re determined semi annually and the available borrowing amount could be increased or reduced 
in addition  forest and the lenders each have discretion at any time  but not more than once during any calendar year  to have the global borrowing base redetermined 
the recent redetermination will not limit these discretionary redeterminations 
if a borrowing base redetermination is less than the outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities  we would be required to repay the amount representing the excess of outstanding borrowings within a prescribed period 
if we were unable to pay the excess amount  it would cause an event of default 
in march  in conjunction with the significant downward revisions to our estimated proved oil and gas reserves  we redetermined the global borrowing base 
effective march   the global borrowing base was set at million  with million allocated to the us credit facility and million allocated to the canadian credit facility 
under the terms of the credit facility  the global borrowing base will next be redetermined in the second quarter of and the amount of available borrowing could be adjusted at that time 
at december   the unused borrowing amount under the global borrowing base was approximately million in addition to amounts outstanding 
on march   after the borrowing base redetermination  our unused borrowing amount was approximately million in addition to amounts outstanding 
at december   there were outstanding borrowings of million under the us credit facility and million under the canadian credit facility  at a weighted average interest rate of 
in addition to outstanding borrowings under forest s credit facilities  there were outstanding borrowings in the amount of million under a small credit facility of an acquired company 
that facility was repaid and terminated january   using additional borrowings under forest s us credit facility 
at march   there were outstanding borrowings of million under the us credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of and there were no borrowings under the canadian credit facility 
at december   we had used the credit facilities for letters of credit in the amount of million 
at march   we had used the credit facilities for letters of credit in the amount of million 
the credit facilities include terms and covenants that place limitations on certain types of activities  including restrictions or requirements with respect to additional debt  liens  asset sales  hedging activities  investments  dividends  and mergers and acquisitions  and include financial covenants 
interest rates and other terms of borrowing under the credit facilities will vary based on our credit ratings and financial condition  as governed by certain financial tests 
in particular  any time that availability is not governed by the global borrowing base  the amount available and our ability to borrow under the credit facility is determined by the financial covenants 
under the global borrowing base  the financial covenants can still affect the amount available and our ability to borrow amounts under the credit facility 
in addition  the credit facilities are collateralized by our assets 
the us credit facility is secured by a lien on  and a security interest in  a portion of our proved oil and gas properties and related assets in the united states and canada  a pledge of of the capital stock of canadian forest and its parent  canada ltd  and a pledge of of the capital stock of forest pipeline company 
the canadian credit facility is secured by a lien on the assets of canadian forest 
under certain circumstances  we could be obligated to pledge additional assets as collateral 
credit ratings 
our bank credit facilities and our senior notes are separately rated by two ratings agencies moody s and s p 
in addition  moody s and s p have assigned forest a general corporate credit rating 
from time to time  our assigned credit ratings may change 
in assigning ratings  the ratings agencies evaluate a number of factors  such as our industry segment  volatility of our industry segment  the geographical mix and diversity of our asset portfolio  the allocation of properties and exploration and drilling activities among short lived and longer lived properties  the need and ability to replace reserves  our cost structure  our debt and capital structure and our general financial condition and prospects 
as a result of the significant downward reserve revisions to our estimated proved resrves in  the rating agencies may downgrade our credit rating 
in february  following the announcement of our downward revisions to our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves  forest was placed on credit watch by both ratings agencies 
our bank credit facilities include conditions that are linked to our credit rating 
the fees and interest rates on our commitments and loans  as well as our collateral obligations  are affected by our credit ratings 
the agreements governing our senior notes do not include adverse triggers that are tied to our credit ratings 
the terms of our senior notes include provisions that will allow us greater flexibility if the credit ratings improve to investment grade and other tests have been satisfied 
in this event  we would have no further obligation to comply with certain restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing the senior notes 
our ability to raise funds and the costs of such financing activities may be affected by our credit rating at the time any such activities are conducted 
dispositions of assets 
as a part of our ongoing operations  we routinely dispose of non strategic assets 
assets with marginal value or which are not consistent with our operating strategy are identified for sale or trade 
during  we disposed of properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil for total proceeds of approximately  during  we disposed of properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil for total proceeds of approximately  during  we disposed of properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil for total proceeds of approximately  of this amount  approximately  related to properties located in the offshore gulf of mexico area in which we sold of our interests in connection with a strategic joint venture program 
on march  we sold the gas marketing assets of promark to cinergy 
cinergy will administer on a prospective basis the canadian netback pool 
for further information see part i  item  business sales and markets  of this form k 
common stock offerings 
in october  forest issued  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds from this offering were approximately  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
forest used the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the acquisition of properties from unocal 
in january  we issued  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds from this offering before any exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  were approximately  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated expenses of the offering 
forest used the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase  immediately following the closing of the offering   shares from the anschutz corporation and certain of its affiliates 
the shares repurchased were cancelled immediately upon repurchase 
in february  an additional  shares of common stock were issued pursuant to exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
the net proceeds of  were used for general corporate purposes 
securities redeemed and repurchased 
in january we redeemed the remaining  outstanding principal amount of our senior subordinated notes at of par value  resulting in a loss of  recorded in the first quarter of contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  after total in thousands bank debt    other long term debt    operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations     approved capital projects   total contractual obligations     bank debt consists of million related to our us and canadian credit facilities and million of bank debt assumed in conjunction with our acquisition of a private company on december  the bank debt assumed in the acquisition was subsequently paid on january  with proceeds from our us credit facility

other long term debt consists of our senior notes 
for a more detailed discussion of our long term debt  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
consists primarily of leases for office space and leases for well equipment rentals 
consists primarily of firm commitments for gathering  processing and pipeline capacity 
gathering  processing and pipeline capacity commitments in areas that have secondary markets may be mitigated in the future if firm capacities are no longer required 
canadian forest  on behalf of the canadian netback pool  has firm commitments for pipeline capacity of approximately  through canadian forest  as one of the producers in the canadian netback pool  supplied of the gas to the canadian netback pool in consists of our net share of budgeted expenditures under authorizations for expenditure afes that were approved by us and our joint venture partners as of december  includes afes for which forest is the operator as well as those operated by others 
in addition to the above commitments  we are committed to make approximately million of capital expenditures over the next five years pursuant to the terms of foreign concession arrangements and an exploration agreement in canada 
nonperformance under these agreements could result in the loss of acreage and concession rights 
we also have other long term liabilities of approximately million  primarily related to benefit obligations for which neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor timing of payment can be precisely determined in advance 
as of december   million of assets were held in trust to satisfy these obligations 
forest also makes delay rental payments to lessors during the primary terms of oil and gas leases to delay drilling of wells  usually for one year 
although we are not obligated to make such payments  discontinuing them would result in the loss of the oil and gas lease 
our total maximum commitment under these leases  through  totaled approximately million as of december  estimated costs related to future abandonment liabilities are recorded on our balance sheet 
there are currently no contractual obligations related to these costs 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
other obligations 
we hold a equity interest in an affiliate that owns a petroleum pipeline system within the cook inlet area of alaska 
in our capacity as a shareholder  we have agreed to fund our proportionate share of the operating costs and expenses of this affiliate 
we may have contingent obligations in the event the affiliate experiences cash deficiencies 
in addition  we may have other contingent obligations if the affiliate is unable to meet its indemnification requirements or its obligations to the operator of the pipeline 
we are unable to predict or quantify the amount of these obligations  although we have obtained insurance to mitigate the impacts of certain possible outcomes 
surety bonds 
in the ordinary course of our business and operations  we are required to post surety bonds from time to time with third parties  including governmental agencies 
as of february   we have obtained surety bonds from a number of insurance and bonding institutions covering certain of our operations in the united states and canada in the aggregate amount of approximately  in connection with their administration of offshore leases in the gulf of mexico  the mms annually evaluates each lessee s plugging and abandonment liabilities 
the mms reviews this information and applies certain financial tests including  but not limited to  current asset and net worth tests 
the mms determines whether each lessee is financially capable of paying the estimated costs of such plugging and abandonment liabilities 
we annually provide the mms with our financial information 
if we do not satisfy the mms requirements  we could be required to post supplemental bonds 
in the past  forest has not been required to post supplemental bonds  however  we cannot assure you that we will satisfy the financial tests and remain on the list of mms lessees exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements 
we cannot predict or quantify the amount of any such supplemental bonds or the annual premiums related thereto  but the amount could be substantial 
see part i  regulation in this form k for further information 
as a result of the significant downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves in  there could be an increase in the cost of and or the amount of credit support insurance  letters of credit  bonds required by our counterparties 
critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments and assumptions alternatives exist among accounting methods we use to report our financial results 
the choice of an accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts 
in addition  application of generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the revenues and expenses reported during the period 
changes in these estimates  judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events  and  accordingly  actual results could differ from amounts estimated 
the more significant areas requiring the use of assumptions  judgments and estimates relate to volumes of oil and gas reserves used in calculating depletion  the amount of future net revenues used in computing the ceiling test limitations and the amount of future capital costs and abandonment obligations used in such calculations 
assumptions  judgments and estimates are also required in determining impairments of undeveloped properties  the valuation of deferred tax assets  and the estimation of fair values for derivative instruments 
the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions and the potential effects thereof are further described in risk factors estimates of oil and gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise in this item and in notes to consolidated financial statements 
full cost method of accounting 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the fair value of estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement and abandonment activities is capitalized  with a corresponding asset retirement obligation liability recorded 
capitalized costs applicable to each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method based on conversion to common units of measure using one barrel of oil as an equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
changes in estimates of reserves or future development costs are accounted for prospectively in the depletion calculations 
assuming consistent production year over year  our depletion expense will be significantly higher or lower if we significantly decrease or increase our estimates of remaining proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties  including related capitalized interest costs  if any  are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool 
where proved reserves are established  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limitation which is based on the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves including the effects of derivative instruments  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  all net of expected income tax effects 
to the extent the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  the excess is charged to earnings 
changes in estimates of discounted future net revenues will affect the calculation of the ceiling limitation 
we did not have any writedowns related to the full cost ceiling limitation in  or as of december   the ceiling limitation exceeded the carrying value of our oil and gas properties by approximately million in the us and million cdn in canada 
estimates of discounted future net cash flows at december  were based on average natural gas prices of approximately per mcf in the us and approximately per mcf in canada and on average liquids prices of approximately per barrel in the us and approximately per barrel in canada 
a reduction in oil and gas prices and or estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves would reduce the ceiling limitation in the us and canada and could result in a ceiling test writedown 
in particular  our canadian full cost pool could be adversely impacted by moderate declines in commodity prices 
in  we revised downward our estimates of proved reserves by bcfe 
as a result of the revisions  we are subject to writedowns of our us and canadian full cost pools under ceiling test limitations pursuant to full cost accounting at higher commodity price thresholds than we were prior to the revisions 
if we were to record writedowns  shareholders equity could be reduced significantly 
in countries where the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  leasehold costs  seismic costs and other costs incurred during the exploration phase remain capitalized as unproved property costs until proved reserves have been established or until exploration activities cease 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of proved reserves  amounts are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to depreciation  depletion and amortization and the application of the ceiling limitation 
if exploration efforts are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves and exploration activities cease  the amounts accumulated as unproved costs are charged against earnings as impairments 
as of december   costs related to these international projects of approximately million were not being depleted pending determination of the existence of proved reserves 
in  we recorded an impairment of million million net of taxes related primarily to concessions in albania  italy  romania  switzerland and tunisia 
no impairments were recorded in in  we recorded impairments of million million net of tax 
of this amount  approximately million million net of taxes was related to albania 
impairments were also recognized in other countries based on expiration of certain concessions and evaluations of projects in those countries 
under the alternative successful efforts method of accounting  surrendered  abandoned and impaired leases  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are depleted on a property by property basis under the successful efforts method 
impairments are assessed on a property by property basis and are charged to expense when assessed 
we believe the full cost method is the appropriate method to use to account for our oil and gas exploration and development activities  because we conduct significant exploration programs in the gulf of mexico  in canada and in various international regions and the full cost method more appropriately reports the costs of these exploration programs as part of an overall investment in discovering and developing proved reserves 
fair values of derivative instruments 
we periodically hedge a portion of our oil and gas production through swap and collar agreements 
the purpose of the hedges is to provide a measure of stability to our cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage the exposure to commodity price risk 
we recognize the fair value of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge  and upon whether or not the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge 
changes in fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized  to the extent the hedge is effective  in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for fair value hedges to the extent the hedge is effective  there is no effect on the statement of operations because changes in fair value of the derivative offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as other income or expense 
the estimation of fair values for our hedging derivatives requires substantial judgment 
the fair values of our derivatives are estimated on a monthly basis using an option pricing model 
the option pricing model uses various factors that include closing exchange prices on the nymex  volatility and the time value of options 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements  and the resulting estimated future cash inflows outflows over the terms of the hedges are discounted using estimated weighted average cost capital 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as to changes in future price forecasts  regional price differentials and interest rates 
entitlements method of accounting for oil and gas sales 
we account for oil and gas sales using the entitlements method 
under the entitlements method  revenue is recorded based upon our ownership share of volumes sold  regardless of whether we have taken our ownership share of such volumes 
we record a receivable or a liability to the extent we receive less or more than our share of the volumes and related revenue 
under the alternative sales method of accounting for oil and gas sales  revenue is recorded based on volumes taken by us or allocated to us by third parties  regardless of whether such volumes are more or less than our ownership share of volumes produced 
reserve estimates are adjusted to reflect any overproduced or underproduced positions 
receivables or payables are recognized on a company s balance sheet only to the extent that remaining reserves are not sufficient to satisfy volumes over or under produced 
make up provisions and ultimate settlements of volume imbalances are generally governed by agreements between forest and its partners with respect to specific properties or  in the absence of such agreements  through negotiation 
the value of volumes over or under produced can change based on changes in commodity prices 
the entitlements method of accounting for oil and gas sales allows for recognition of revenue based on forest s actual share of jointly owned production  and matches revenue with related operating expenses 
in addition  it provides balance sheet recognition of the estimated value of product imbalances 
as of december  forest had recorded the following amounts in the accompanying balance sheet related to our gas imbalances value volumes in thousands mmcf gas imbalance receivable   gas imbalance liability   net gas imbalance receivable  valuation of deferred tax assets 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax bases temporary differences 
future income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are likely to reverse 
the effect on future income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is included in operations in the period in which the change is enacted 
the amount of future income tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses accounting and reporting for business combinations and is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
addresses the accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
the new standard eliminates the requirement to amortize acquired goodwill  instead  such goodwill is required to be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
the new standard also requires that  at a minimum  all intangible assets be aggregated and presented as a separate line item in the balance sheet 
the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets 
the emerging issues task force is currently considering two reporting issues regarding the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
the issues are whether sfas no 
and sfas no 
require registrants to classify the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
historically  we have included the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a component of oil and gas properties 
if it is ultimately determined that oil and gas companies are required to classify costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet  we would be required to reclassify approximately million to million at december  and approximately million to million at december   out of oil and gas properties and into a separate intangible assets line item 
our total balance sheet  cash flows and results of operations would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with full cost accounting rules 
further  we do not believe the classification of the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets would have any impact on our compliance with covenants under our debt agreements 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 was issued in april this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 
 was issued may sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures three classes of freestanding financial instruments mandatorily redeemable instruments  instruments with repurchase obligations  and instruments with obligations to issue a variable number of shares with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
instruments within the scope of the statement must be classified as liabilities on the balance sheet 
sfas no 
is effective for all freestanding financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  forest does not currently hold any financial instruments within the scope of sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january we will be required to apply fin r to variable interests in variable interest entities vies  if any  created after december  we do not currently own any interests in vies  therefore  fin r will not affect our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors forest has made in this form k  and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings  press releases and discussions with management  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements include statements  among others  about forest s operations  performance and financial results and condition  as described in more detail in part i  item of this form k  under the heading forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
some of these risks and uncertainties are detailed below and elsewhere in this form k and in forest s other public filings  press releases and discussions with forest s management 
forest undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  except as required by law 
in addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating forest 
oil and gas price declines could adversely affect forest s revenue  cash flows and profitability 
prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely 
forest s revenues  profitability and future rate of growth depend substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
increases and decreases in prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow from banks may be subject to redetermination based on changes in prices 
in addition  we may have ceiling test write downs when prices decline 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that forest can produce economically 
any substantial or extended decline in the prices of or demand for oil and natural gas would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices 
factors that can cause price fluctuations include relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political and economic conditions in oil producing countries  particularly those in the middle east  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price of oil and gas imports  or general economic conditions 
hedging transactions may limit our potential gains 
in order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil and natural gas  we enter into oil and gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production 
our hedges are limited in duration  usually for periods of one year or less 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and gas prices  such transactions may limit our potential gains if oil and gas prices rise over the price established by the arrangements 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  the counterparties to our future contracts fail to perform under the contracts  or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
we cannot assure you that our hedging transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of any decline in oil or natural gas prices 
for further information concerning prices  market conditions and energy swap and collar agreements  see part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk of this form k  and notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain parties with whom we have long term and short term contracts may fail to perform 
we have long term and short term contracts  including agreements for the sale of oil and natural gas 
parties to these agreements could fail to perform their contractual obligations as a result of circumstances that are beyond our control 
our ability to enforce these contractual obligations may be adversely affected by bankruptcy and other creditors rights laws 
we cannot guarantee that our oil and gas purchasers will not experience material changes in their financial condition that would impact our ability to collect outstanding amounts and efficiently market our oil and gas production 
we may not be able to obtain adequate financing to execute our operating strategy 
we have historically addressed our long term liquidity needs through the use of bank credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities as well as through the issuance of debt and equity securities when market conditions permit 
we continue to examine the following alternative sources of long term capital bank borrowings or the issuance of debt securities  the issuance of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities  sales of properties  the issuance of nonrecourse production based financing or net profits interests  sales of prospects and technical information  and joint venture financing 
the availability of these sources of capital will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include general economic and financial market conditions  oil and natural gas prices and the value and performance of forest 
we may be unable to execute our operating strategy if we cannot obtain capital from these sources 
we may not be able to fund our planned capital expenditures 
we spend and will continue to spend a substantial amount of capital for the development  exploration  acquisition and production of oil and natural gas reserves 
our capital expenditures for exploration and development during were million  and totaled million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  in and we expended million and million  respectively  for oil and gas property acquisitions 
we expect such capital expenditures in to be approximately million to million 
if low oil and natural gas prices  drilling or production delays  operating difficulties or other factors  many of which are beyond our control  cause our revenues and cash flows from operations to decrease  we may be limited in our ability to spend the capital necessary to complete our drilling and development program 
in october  we elected to determine availability under our bank credit facility based on a global borrowing base that is re determined semi annually  and may be re determined at other times during a year at the option of the company or the lenders 
in march  we re determined the global borrowing base due to the significant downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves at december  the global borrowing base was reduced and may be subject to further reductions if oil and gas prices decline or we have additional downward revisions 
see leverage will materially affect our operations below 
in addition  if availability under our credit facilities is reduced as a result of a borrowing base limitation or the covenants and financial tests contained in the agreements  our ability to fund our planned capital expenditures could be adversely affected 
after utilizing our available sources of financing  we could be forced to raise additional debt or equity proceeds to fund such expenditures 
we cannot assure you that additional debt or equity financing or cash generated by operations will be available to meet these requirements 
a curtailment of capital spending could adversely affect our ability to replace production and our future cash flow from operations 
estimates of oil and gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
this form k contains estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves and the estimated future net cash flows from such reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the securities and exchange commission relating to oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses may vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth 
in certain situations  hydrocarbon reservoirs underlying our properties may extend beyond the boundaries of our own acreage to adjacent acreage owned by others 
in this case  our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by the operators on those adjacent properties 
also  we may revise estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
such variances may be material 
for example  see our discussion of reserve revisions in part i  item  properties  of this form k 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped compared to at december  recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
in estimating our proved reserves we have assumed that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our oil and gas reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles  we cannot assure you that actual costs will not vary from the estimates  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results will be as estimated 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this form k is the current market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in consumption by purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the securities and exchange commission to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor for forest 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with forest or the oil and gas industry in general will affect the appropriateness of the discount factor 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is a complex subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and their recoverability that cannot be measured in an exact way 
such process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the interpretation of such data 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
leverage will materially affect our operations 
as of december   our long term debt was approximately million  including approximately million outstanding under our global bank credit facilities 
our long term debt represented of our total capitalization at december  our level of debt affects our operations in several important ways  including the following a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is used to pay interest on borrowings  the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt limit our ability to borrow additional funds  to dispose of assets  or to pay dividends  the global borrowing base and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  a high level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes  and the terms of the agreements governing our debt permit our creditors to accelerate payments upon an event of default including an event of default under other agreements or a change of control 
in addition  we may alter our capitalization significantly in order to make future acquisitions or develop our properties 
these changes in capitalization may increase our level of debt significantly 
a high level of debt increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on our future performance 
general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors affect our operations  our future performance and our ability to raise additional capital 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
if we are unable to repay our debt at maturity out of cash on hand  we could attempt to refinance such debt  or repay such debt with the proceeds of any equity offering 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt or that future debt or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance such debt 
in october  we elected to determine availability under our bank credit facility based on a global borrowing base that is re determined semi annually  and may be re determined at other times during a year at our option or the lenders 
in march  we re determined the global borrowing base due to the significant downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves at december  the global borrowing base was reduced  may be subject to further reductions if oil and gas prices decline or we have additional downward revisions 
if  following such a redetermination  our outstanding borrowings exceed the amount of the re determined borrowing base  we will be forced to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings in excess of the re determined borrowing base 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to make such repayments 
if we are not able to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or to arrange new financing  we may have to sell significant assets 
any such sale would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions  our credit ratings and our value and performance at the time of such offering or other financing 
we cannot assure you that any such offering or refinancing can be successfully completed 
lower oil and gas prices may cause us to record ceiling limitation writedowns 
we use the full cost method of accounting to report our oil and gas operations 
accordingly  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling test writedown 
this charge would not impact cash flow from operating activities  but would reduce our shareholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile 
in addition  writedowns may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our undeveloped property values  if estimated future development costs increase or if purchasers cancel long term contracts for our natural gas production 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience ceiling test writedowns in the future 
for example  our canadian full cost pool  in particular  could be adversely impacted by moderate declines in commodity prices 
we may incur significant abandonment costs or be required to post substantial performance bonds in connection with the plugging and abandonment of wells  platforms and pipelines 
we are responsible for the costs associated with the plugging of wells  the removal of facilities and equipment and site restoration on our oil and gas properties  pro rata to our working interest 
future liabilities for projected abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values  are included as a reduction in the future cash flows from our reserves in our reserve reporting 
as of december   our estimated discounted asset retirement obligation liability recorded in the balance sheet was approximately million  primarily for properties in offshore gulf of mexico and alaska waters 
approximately million of abandonment costs are anticipated to be incurred in  all of which are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations 
estimates of abandonment costs and their timing may change due to many factors  including actual drilling and production results  inflation rates  changes in abandonment techniques and technology  and changes in environmental laws and regulations 
we may not be able to replace production with new reserves 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics 
many gulf of mexico reservoirs experience high decline rates  while the decline rates in long lived fields in other regions are lower 
production from the gulf coast reservoirs represented approximately of our total production in and is expected to be a greater percentage in our reserves will decline as they are produced unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities 
forest s future natural gas and oil production is highly dependent upon its level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain 
we may be unable to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and gas reserves if cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
we cannot assure you that our future exploration  development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
our operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and gas drilling and production activities 
oil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found 
the cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain 
oil and gas drilling and production activities may be shortened  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include unexpected drilling conditions  geological irregularities or pressure in formations  equipment failures or accidents  weather conditions  shortages in labor  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment  and failure to secure necessary regulatory approvals and permits 
the prevailing prices of oil and natural gas also affect the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs  production equipment and related services 
we cannot assure you that the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 
drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable 
drilling activities can result in dry wells and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs 
our industry experiences numerous operating risks 
the exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas involves risks 
these operating risks include the risk of fire  explosions  blow outs  pipe failure  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards 
environmental hazards include oil spills  gas leaks  pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these industry operating risks occur  we could have substantial losses 
substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
for example  a substantial portion of our oil and gas operations is located offshore in the gulf of mexico 
the gulf of mexico area experiences tropical weather disturbances  some of which can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
also  we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
our international operations may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations and economic and political developments 
we have significant oil and gas operations in canada 
the expenses of such operations  which represented approximately of consolidated cash costs of oil and gas operations  are payable in canadian dollars 
most of the revenue from canadian natural gas and oil sales  which represented of total oil and gas revenue in  is based upon us dollars price indices 
as a result  canadian operations are subject to the risk of fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian and us dollars 
we have also acquired additional oil and gas assets in other countries 
although there are no material operations in these countries  our foreign operations may also be adversely affected by political and economic developments  royalty and tax increases and other laws or policies in these countries  as well as us policies affecting trade  taxation and investment in other countries 
in south africa we have an interest in offshore properties with the potential for gas production 
no proved reserves have been assigned to these properties as commercial sales contracts have not been established 
if we are unable to arrange for commercial use of these properties  we may not be able to recoup our investment and will not realize our anticipated financial and operating results for these properties 
competition within our industry may adversely affect our operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
forest competes with major and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties and the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties 
forest also competes with major and independent oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and natural gas 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours 
our future acquisitions may not contain economically recoverable reserves 
a successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control 
these factors include recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with such assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties  which we believe is generally consistent with industry practices 
however  such a review may not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in addition  the review will not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
we do not inspect every platform or well 
even when a platform or well is inspected  structural and environmental problems are not necessarily discovered 
we are not always able to obtain contractual indemnification for pre closing liabilities  including environmental liabilities 
in addition  competition for producing oil and gas properties is intense and many of our competitors have financial and other resources which are substantially greater than those available to us 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire oil and gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or that we will acquire such properties at acceptable prices 
there are uncertainties in successfully integrating our acquisitions 
integrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks 
these risks include the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations and that unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and retaining and assimilating the employees 
in addition  although we perform a diligent review of the properties acquired in connection with such acquisitions in accordance with industry practices  such reviews are inherently incomplete 
these reviews may not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to fully assess the deficiencies and potential associated with the properties 
any of these or similar risks could lead to potential adverse short term or long term effects on our operating results 
the marketability of our production depends largely upon the availability  proximity and capacity of gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
transportation space on such gathering systems and pipelines is occasionally limited and at times unavailable due to repairs or improvements being made to such facilities or due to such space being utilized by other companies with priority transportation agreements 
the available capacity  or lack of available capacity  on these systems and facilities  could result in the shutting in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
our access to transportation options can also be affected by us federal and state and canadian regulation of oil and gas production and transportation  general economic conditions  and changes in supply and demand 
these factors and the availability of markets are beyond our control 
if market factors dramatically change  the financial impact on forest could be substantial and could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas 
our oil and gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations that materially affect our operations 
our oil and gas operations are subject to various us federal  state and local and canadian federal and provincial governmental regulations 
these regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions 
matters regulated include permits for discharges of wastewaters and other substances generated in connection with drilling operations  bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well plugging and abandonment costs  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
at various times  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on oil and gas production 
in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas  these agencies have restricted the rates of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity 
in addition  the federal oil pollution act opa  as amended  requires operators of offshore facilities to prove that they have the financial capability to respond to costs that may be incurred in connection with potential oil spills 
under the opa and other federal and state environmental statutes  owners and operators of certain defined facilities are strictly liable for such spills of oil and other regulated substances  subject to certain limitations 
a substantial spill from one of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  competitive position or financial condition 
us and us laws regulate production  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of oil and gas  by products from oil and gas and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations 
we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
we do not pay dividends 
we have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock in a number of years and have no intention to do so in the near future 
in addition  we are limited in the amount we can pay by our credit facilities and the indentures pursuant to which our subordinated notes were issued 
our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws have provisions that discourage corporate takeovers and could prevent shareholders from realizing a premium on their investment 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws and provisions of the new york business corporation law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
our directors are elected to staggered terms 
also  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval and to set the rights  preferences and other designations  including voting rights of those shares as the board may determine 
additional provisions include restrictions on business combinations  the availability of authorized but unissued common stock and notice requirements for shareholder proposals and director nominations 
these provisions  alone or in combination with each other and with the rights plan described below  may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to shareholders for their common stock 
our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan 
the existence of the rights plan may impede a takeover of forest not supported by the board of directors  including a proposed takeover that may be desired by a majority of our shareholders or involving a premium over the prevailing market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk we produce and sell natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids for our own account in the united states and canada 
as a result  our financial results are affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
such effects can be significant 
in order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in prices  we enter into long term contracts for a portion of our production and use a hedging strategy 
under our hedging strategy  we enter into commodity swaps  collars and other financial instruments 
all of our commodity swaps and collar agreements and a portion of our basis swaps in place at december  have been designated as cash flow hedges 
these arrangements  which are based on prices available in the financial markets at the time the contracts are entered into  are settled in cash and do not require physical deliveries of hydrocarbons 
we periodically assess the estimated portion of our anticipated production that is subject to hedging arrangements  and we adjust this percentage based on our assessment of market conditions and the availability of hedging arrangements that meet our criteria 
hedging arrangements covered   and of our consolidated production  on an equivalent basis  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
long term sales contracts 
a significant portion of canadian forest s natural gas production is sold through the canadian netback pool which was administered by promark on behalf of canadian forest in and early at december   the canadian netback pool had entered into fixed price contracts to sell natural gas at the following quantities and weighted average prices natural gas bcf contract price per mcf cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn 
cdn the administrator of the canadian netback pool aggregates gas from producers for sale to markets across north america 
currently  in addition to canadian forest  over producers have contracted with the canadian netback pool 
the producers are paid a netback price which reflects all of the revenue from approved customers less the costs of delivery including transportation  audit and shortfall makeup costs and an operator marketing fee 
canadian forest  as one of the producers in the canadian netback pool  is obligated to supply its contract quantity 
in  canadian forest supplied of the total netback pool sales quantity 
in the contract year  it is estimated that canadian forest will supply approximately of the canadian netback pool quantity 
we expect that canadian forest s pro rata obligations as a gas producer will increase in and future years 
in order to satisfy its supply obligations to the canadian netback pool  canadian forest may be required to cover its obligations in the market 
the administrator of the canadian netback pool  now cinergy  is required to acquire gas in the event of a shortfall between the gas supply and market obligations 
a shortfall could occur if a gas producer fails to deliver its contractual share of the supply obligations of the canadian netback pool 
the cost of purchasing gas to cover any shortfall is a cost of the canadian netback pool 
the prices paid for shortfall gas would typically be spot market prices and may differ from the market prices received from the customers of the canadian netback pool 
higher spot prices would reduce the average canadian netback pool price paid to the gas producers  including canadian forest 
shortfalls in gas produced may occur in the future 
we cannot predict with any certainty the amount of any such shortfalls 
in addition to its commitments to the netback pool  canadian forest is committed to sell natural gas at the following quantities and weighted average prices natural gas bcf contract price per mcf

cdn hedging program 
in a typical commodity swap agreement  forest receives the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon published  third party index if the index price is lower 
if the index price is higher  forest pays the difference 
by entering into swap agreements we effectively fix the price that we will receive in the future for the hedged production 
our current swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis 
as of december   forest had entered into the following swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges natural gas oil nymex wti bbtus per day average hedged price per mmbtu barrels per day average hedged price per bbl first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  between january  and march   we did not enter into any additional swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges 
we also enter into collar agreements with third parties 
a collar agreement is similar to a swap agreement  except that we receive the difference between the floor price and the index price only if the index price is below the floor price  and we pay the difference between the ceiling price and the index price only if the index price is above the ceiling price 
in addition  forest has entered into three way collars with third parties 
these instruments establish two floors and one ceiling 
upon settlement  if the index price is below the lowest floor  we receive the difference between the two floors 
if the index price is between the two floors  we receive the difference between the higher of the two floors and the index price 
if the index price is between the higher floor and the ceiling  we do not receive or pay any additional amounts 
if the index price is above the ceiling  we pay the excess over the ceiling price 
collars are also settled in cash  either on a monthly basis or at the end of their terms 
by entering into collars  we effectively provide a floor for the price that we will receive for the hedged production  however  the collar also establishes a maximum price that we will receive for the hedged production if prices increase above the ceiling price 
we enter into collars during periods of volatile commodity prices in order to protect against a significant decline in prices in exchange for foregoing the benefit of price increases in excess of the ceiling price on the hedged production 
as of december   forest had entered into the following gas and oil collars accounted for as cash flow hedges natural gas bbtus per day average floor price per mmbtu average ceiling price per mmbtu first quarter oil nymex wti barrels per day average floor price per bbl average ceiling price per bbl first quarter  between january  and march   we entered into the following additional collars accounted for as cash flow hedges natural gas bbtus per day average floor price per mmbtu average ceiling price per mmbtu fourth quarter first quarter as of december   forest had entered into the following way natural gas collars accounted for as cash flow hedges natural gas bbtus per day average lower floor price per mmbtu average upper floor price per mmbtu average ceiling price per mmbtu first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter between january  and march   we entered into the following additional way collars accounted for as cash flow hedges oil nymex wti barrels per day average lower floor price per bbl average upper floor price per bbl average ceiling price per bbl first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  we also use basis swaps in conjunction with natural gas swaps in order to fix the differential price between the nymex price and the index price at which the hedged gas is sold 
as of december   forest had entered into basis swaps designated as cash flow hedges with weighted average volumes of bbtus per day for between january  and march   we did not enter into any additional basis swaps designated as cash flow hedges 
the fair value of our cash flow hedges based on the futures prices quoted on december  was a loss of approximately   after tax which was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
as of december   forest had entered into basis swaps that were not designated as cash flow hedges with weighted average volumes of bbtus per day for and weighted average volumes of bbtus per day for between january  and march  we entered into additional basis swaps not designated as cash flow hedges with weighted average volumes of bbtus per day for and bbtus per day for the fair value of our derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges based on the futures prices quoted on december  was a gain of approximately  foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business in several foreign currencies and thus are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing and investing transactions 
in the past  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk 
expenditures incurred relative to the foreign concessions held by forest outside of north america have been primarily us dollar denominated  as have cash proceeds related to property sales and farmout arrangements 
interest rate risk the following table presents principal amounts and related average fixed interest rates by year of maturity for forest s debt obligations at december  total fair value dollar amounts in thousands bank credit facilities variable rate    average interest rate long term debt fixed rate      coupon interest rate effective interest rate includes debt of  with an interest rate of at december   which was paid on january  the average interest rate without this debt would have been
