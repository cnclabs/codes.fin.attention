k is a premier sporting goods company with a diverse portfolio of leading sporting goods brands 
k additionally offers other recreational products as well as certain niche industrial products 
sporting goods represented million  or  of k s consolidated net sales  other recreational products represented million in net sales  and k s manufacturing and supply of selected industrial products  had sales of million in overview k believes that in there were two major trends in the sporting goods industry 
first  the sporting goods market experienced little or no growth in wholesale sales during second  there was a growing influence of large format sporting goods retailers and retailer buying groups as well as the consolidation of certain sporting goods retailers worldwide  all of which has resulted in a consolidation of sporting goods suppliers 
based on these market trends  k believes that the most successful sporting goods suppliers will be those with greater financial and other resources  including those with the ability to produce or source high quality  low cost products and deliver these products on a timely basis  to invest in product development projects and the ability to access distribution channels with a broad array of products and brands 
in addition  as the influence of large sporting goods retailers grows  management believes these retailers will prefer to rely on fewer and larger sporting goods suppliers to help them manage the supply of products and the allocation of shelf space 
as a result of these market trends  k has embarked upon an aggressive program to leverage its existing operations and to complement and diversify its product offerings within the sporting goods and recreational products 
k intends to implement its internal growth strategy by continuing to improve operating efficiencies  extending its product offerings through new product launches and maximizing its extensive distribution channels

the newly acquired brands have helped k balance the seasonality of its business and strengthen its customer relationships 
k has entered several new sports markets such as baseball  softball  paintball  lacrosse and snowshoeing  which provides k with additional platforms for future growth opportunities

environmental matters k is one of several named potentially responsible parties prp in three environmental protection agency matters involving discharge of hazardous materials at old waste sites in south carolina and michigan 
although environmental laws technically impose joint and several liability upon each prp at each site  the extent of k s required financial contribution to the cleanup of these sites is expected to be limited based upon the number and financial strength of the other named prp s and the volume and types of waste involved which might be attributable to k environmental and related remediation costs are difficult to quantify for a number of reasons including the number of parties involved  the difficulty in determining the extent of the contamination  the length of time remediation may require  the complexity of environmental regulation and the continuing advancement of remediation technology 
k accrues for liabilities of this nature when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
at december  and december   k had recorded an estimated liability of approximately  and  respectively  for environmental liabilities with no insurance recovery expected 
the estimates are based on k s share of the costs to remediate as provided by the prp s consultants and in ongoing discussions with the epa or other environmental agencies 
the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  however  and taking into consideration reserves provided  management does not believe these matters will have a material adverse effect on k s financial statements 
newly adopted accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards boards fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
the primary objectives of this interpretation are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities and how to determine when and which business enterprise the primary beneficiary should consolidate the variable interest entity 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either i the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest  or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that the primary beneficiary  as well as all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity  make additional disclosures 
certain disclosure requirements of fin were effective for financial statements issued after january  in december  the fasb issued fin no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r to address certain fin implementation issues 
the effective dates and impact of fin and fin r are as follows i special purpose entities spe s created prior to february  k must apply either the provisions of fin or early adopt the provisions of fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december  ii non spe s created prior to february  k is required to adopt fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  iii all entities  regardless of whether a spe  that was created subsequent to january  the provisions of fin were applicable for variable interests in entities obtained after january  k is required to adopt fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  the adoption of the provisions applicable to spe s and all other variable interests obtained after january  did not have an impact on k s financial statements 
k is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin r applicable to non spe s created prior to february  but does not expect a material impact 
critical accounting policies k s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon k s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires k to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
discussed below are several significant accounting policies  which require the use of judgments and estimates that may materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
the estimates described below are reviewed from time to time and are subject to change if the circumstances so indicate 
the effect of any such change is reflected in results of operations for the period in which the change is made 
establishment of the reserves affecting inventories and the allowance for doubtful accounts are among the most important 
revenue recognition k recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment to its customers  which is at the point in time risk of loss is transferred to the customer  net of reserves for estimated returns 
as a general matter  customers have no right of return  however returns do occur from time to time for a variety of reasons  including local business practices in one of the foreign countries in which k does business 
reserves for estimated returns are established based upon historical return rates and recorded as reductions of sales 
warranty k records the estimated cost of product warranties at the time sales are recognized 
k estimates warranty obligation by reference to historical product warranty return rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting the product 
should actual product warranty return rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the historical rates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
accounts receivable and allowances accounts receivable are the result of k s worldwide sales activities 
although k s credit risk is spread across a large number of customers within a wide geographic area  periodic concentrations within a specific industry occur due to the seasonality of its businesses 
at december  and  k s receivables from sporting goods retailers who sell skis  skates  snowboards and bikes  amounted to and  respectively  of total receivables 
k generally does not require collateral and performs periodic credit evaluations to manage its credit risk 
k evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where there is knowledge of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collected 
for all other customers  reserves are established based on historical bad debts  customer payment patterns and current economic conditions 
the establishment of these reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
if the financial condition of k s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required resulting in an additional charge to expenses when made 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is substantially determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
k records adjustments to its inventory for estimated obsolescence or diminution in market value equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  based on market conditions from time to time 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual experience if future economic conditions  levels of consumer demand  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
in  k recorded a total charge of approximately million  relating to the write down in the value of small wheeled products as the result of a significant softening of the market for such products during the year  and for inventory disposals resulting from the closure of certain manufacturing facilities and an additional million in and million in relating to the small wheeled products 
long lived and finite lived intangible assets purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  ranging from one to eleven years 
long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
k assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flow the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
when an impairment is identified  k reduces the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or  when available and appropriate  comparable market values 
k determined there were no indicators of impairment of long lived assets as of december  k has evaluated the remaining useful lives of its finite lived purchased intangible assets to determine if any adjustments to the useful lives were necessary or if any of these assets had indefinite lives and were therefore not subject to amortization 
k determined that no adjustments to the useful lives of its finite lived purchased intangible assets were necessary 
the finite lived purchased intangible assets consist of patents  customer contracts and customer lists  licensing agreements and tradenames trademarks which have weighted average useful lives of approximately years  years  years and years  respectively 
indefinite lived intangible assets effective january   k adopted new accounting standards on business combinations  and goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with these new standards  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
as required by the new standards  the impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a k reporting unit with the net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  accordingly the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the impairment test for other intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the extent of such charge 
k s estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors  including assumptions about the projected future cash flows  discount rate  growth rate  determination of market comparables  technological change  economic conditions  or changes to k s business operations 
such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods 
the fair value of k s reporting units was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of a reporting unit is calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
future cash flows are estimated by k under the market approach  fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies 
based on the results of the annual impairment tests  k determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of december  however  future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings 
k will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there may be a potential impairment 
income taxes income taxes are recorded using the liability method 
k estimates actual current tax exposure together with temporary differences that result from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
k then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is unlikely  a valuation allowance must be established 
a significant portion of k s deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards for both domestic and foreign purposes 
the realization of these assets is based upon estimates of future taxable income 
in those jurisdictions where the realization of these carryforwards is not likely  a valuation allowance has been established 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  additional income tax expense may be required 
pensions k sponsors several trusteed noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of its domestic employees 
pension costs and liabilities are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on assumptions related to the discount rate  projected compensation increases and expected return on assets 
the discount rate assumption is based on the moody s aa effective annual yield rate as of december  the salary growth assumptions reflect long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management s future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio 
k evaluates the assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments as necessary 
as of december   k s assumption related to the discount rate  projected compensation increases and expected return on assets was  and  respectively 
due to the lower expectations of asset returns and the declining interest rate environment in  k lowered its discount rate and expected return on assets assumptions to and  respectively  at december  a continued variance in the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase could have a significant impact on the pension costs recorded 
due to the lower discount rate and declines in the stock market during and  actual asset returns on k s pension assets did not meet k s assumption of and expected returns 
this resulted in pension expense being higher than pension expense by approximately million which is reflected in the general and administrative expenses 
for the year  market conditions improved which resulted in asset returns on pension assets exceeding expectations 
these asset returns are estimated to result in a decrease in pension expense of approximately  however  the decrease in the discount rate from to is estimated to result in an increase in pension expense of approximately  in addition  the decrease in the expected return on assets assumption from to is estimated to result in an additional increase to pension expense of approximately  finally  as a result of the lower discount rate and lower asset returns  k estimates a required cash contribution of approximately million to the pension plans in based on the decrease in the discount rate and lower expected asset returns  the accumulated benefit obligation of the pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by million and million at december  and  respectively 
these asset shortfalls resulted in k recording a non cash charge to other comprehensive income  a component of k s shareholder s equity  of million million  net of taxes at december  based on this amount recorded  k had million and million  of net pension liabilities as of december  and  respectively  consisting of and million  respectively  in asset shortfalls and an intangible asset for the unrecognized prior service cost of million and million  respectively 
as of december   k treated million of the pension liability as current and million as long term as k estimates a million contribution during the twelve months ended december  foreign currency translation the functional currency for most foreign operations is the local currency 
the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been translated into united states dollars 
asset and liability accounts have been translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expense accounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the year 
the gains and losses associated with the translation of the financial statements resulting from the changes in exchange rates from year to year have been reported in the other comprehensive income or loss account in shareholders equity 
to the extent assets and liabilities of the foreign operations are realized or the foreign operations pay back intercompany debt  amounts previously reported in other comprehensive income or loss account would be included in net income or loss in the period in which the transaction occurs 
transaction gains or losses  other than those related to intercompany accounts and investments deemed to be of a long term nature  are included in net income or loss in the period in which they occur 
impact of inflation and changing prices the inflation rate  as measured by the consumer price index  has been relatively low in the last few years  and therefore  pricing decisions by k have largely been influenced by competitive market conditions 
depreciation expense is based on the historical cost to k of its fixed assets  and therefore  is considerably less than it would be if it were based on current replacement cost 
while buildings  machinery and equipment acquired in prior years will ultimately have to be replaced at significantly higher prices  it is expected this will be a gradual process over many years 
factors that could affect future results because of the following factors  as well as other factors affecting our business  financial position  results of operations and prospects  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
k s strategic plan  involving growth through the acquisition of other companies  may not succeed 
k s strategic plan involves rapid growth through the acquisition of other companies 
such growth involves a number of risks  including the difficulties related to combining previously separate businesses into a single unit  the substantial diversion of management s attention from day to day operations  the assumption of liabilities of an acquired business  including unforeseen liabilities  the failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  the dilution of existing stockholders and convertible note holders due to the issuance of equity securities  utilization of cash reserves  or incurrence of debt in order to fund the acquisitions  the potentially substantial transaction costs associated with acquisitions  and the difficulties related to assimilating the products  personnel and systems of an acquired business and to integrating distribution and other operational capabilities 
current and future financings may place a significant debt burden on k borrowings under k s existing million revolving credit facility and under its million term loan  together with outstanding convertible debentures of million in the aggregate  as well as potential future financings  may substantially increase k s current indebtedness 
among other things  such increased indebtedness could adversely affect k s ability to expand its business  market its products and make investments and capital expenditures  adversely affect the cost and availability of funds from commercial lenders  debt financing transactions and other sources  adversely affect the ability of k to pursue its acquisition strategy  and create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with lower debt levels 
k faces intense competition and potential competition from companies with greater resources  and if it is unable to compete effectively with these companies  its business could be harmed 
the markets for sporting goods and recreational products in which k competes are generally highly competitive  especially as to product innovation  performance and styling  price  marketing and delivery 
competition regarding these products  other than active wear  consists of a relatively small number of large producers  some of whom have greater financial and other resources than k in addition  many of k s competitors offer sports and recreational equipment not currently sold by k and may be able to leverage these broader product offerings to adversely affect k s competitive market position 
further  there are no significant technological or capital barriers to entry into the markets for many sporting goods and recreational products 
the sales of leisure products are also affected by changes in the economy and consumer tastes  and sporting goods and recreational products face competition from other leisure activities 
k s industrial products are  in most instances  subject to price competition  ranging from moderate in marine antennas and monofilament line to intense for commodity type products 
many industrial competitors have greater financial and other resources than k purchasing decisions made by a small number of large format sporting goods retailers can have a significant impact on k s results 
although the sporting goods manufacturing industry is highly fragmented  many of the retail customers that purchase sporting goods are highly concentrated 
large format sporting goods retailers are important to k s results of operations  and wal mart accounted for over of k s net sales for the year ended december  due to their size  these retailers may demand better prices and terms from k  and these demands may have an adverse impact on k s margins 
in addition  if any of these large format sporting goods retailers were to decide to materially reduce the amounts or types of k products that they purchase  such decision would have a material adverse impact on k s business 
k s failure to keep pace with rapid change in marketing strategies  product design  styles and tastes could harm its business 
consumer demand for recreational products is strongly influenced by matters of taste and style 
k cannot assure you that k will successfully develop new products to address new or shifting consumer demand 
an unexpected change in consumer tastes or product demand could seriously harm k s business 
k s inability to timely and successfully respond to developments and changing styles could hurt its competitive position or render its products noncompetitive 
k cannot assure you that demand for its products will remain constant 
the sales of leisure products are affected by changes in the economy and consumer tastes  both of which are difficult to predict 
continued adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world  including a general tightening of the availability of credit  increasing energy costs  declining consumer confidence and significant declines in the stock market could lead to a further reduction in discretionary spending for consumer products 
the weak financial conditions of some of k s customers may adversely impact k s business 
a large portion of k s sales are to sporting goods retailers 
many of k s smaller retailers and some larger retailers are not strongly capitalized 
adverse conditions in the sporting goods retail industry can adversely impact the ability of retailers to purchase k products  or could lead retailers to request credit terms that would adversely affect k s cash flow and involve significant risks of nonpayment 
k s financial results vary from quarter to quarter  which could hurt k s business and the market price of its stock 
various factors affect k s quarterly operating results and some of them are not within k s control 
they include  among others weather and snow conditions  the timing and introduction of new products  the mix of products sold  the timing of significant orders from and shipments to customers  product pricing and discounts  the timing of its acquisitions of other companies and businesses  and general economic conditions 
these and other factors are likely to cause financial results of k to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
if revenue or operating results fall short of the levels expected by public market analysts and investors  the trading price of k common stock could decline dramatically 
based on the foregoing  k believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its results of operations may not be meaningful 
therefore  purchasers of k common stock should not view k s historical results of operations as reliable indications of its future performance 
certain k businesses are highly seasonal 
certain k businesses are highly seasonal 
historically  certain of k s businesses  such as baseball and softball  skis and snowboards  bikes  in line skates  fishing tackle and water sports products have experienced seasonal swings in their businesses depending on their respective products 
this seasonality impacts k s working capital requirements and hence overall financing needs 
in addition  k s borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility is impacted by the seasonal change in receivables 
k may not be able to attract or retain the management employees necessary to remain competitive in its industry  the loss of one or more of k s key personnel  including mr 
richard j 
heckmann  chairman and chief executive officer of k  could have a material adverse effect on k s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
k s continued success depends on the retention  recruitment and continued contributions of k s key management  finance  marketing and staff personnel  many of whom would be difficult or impossible to replace 
the competition for qualified personnel is intense 
k cannot assure you that it will be able to retain its current personnel or recruit the key personnel it requires 
specifically  mr 
richard j 
heckmann  k s chairman and chief executive officer  has been fundamental to developing k s growth strategy and  without his services  k s implementation of its growth strategy might fail 
in addition  k does not have employment agreements with most members of its senior management team 
the loss of services of members of k s key personnel  including mr 
heckmann  could have a material adverse effect on k s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
international operations  unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies may seriously harm k s financial condition 
k s business is dependent on international trade  both for sales of finished goods and low cost manufacturing and sourcing of products 
k s three principal markets are north america  europe and asia 
k s revenues from international operations were approximately of k s sales for the year ended december  k expects that its revenues from international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenues 
any political developments adversely affecting trade with europe or asia could severely impact k results of operations 
k s international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including recessions in foreign economies  the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions  limitations on repatriation of earnings  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing foreign operations  social  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  acts of war and terrorism  ability to finance foreign operations  changes in consumer tastes and trends  tariffs and other trade barriers  and us government licensing requirements for export 
in addition  k will continue to outsource a number of its supply contracts to entities in foreign nations and will continue to be highly reliant on overseas manufacturing 
specifically  k maintains significant manufacturing capacity in china and costa rica 
political or economic developments adversely affecting the operation of these facilities could result in late deliveries  lower sales and earnings  and unanticipated costs 
changes in currency exchange rates could affect k s revenues 
a significant portion of k s production and approximately of k s sales for the year ended december  are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to exchange rate fluctuation risk 
although k engages in some hedging activities to reduce foreign exchange transaction risk  changes in the exchange rates between the united states dollar and the currencies of europe and asia could made k products less competitive in foreign markets  and could reduce the sales and earnings represented by foreign currencies 
additionally  such fluctuation could result in an increase in cost of products sold in foreign markets reducing margins and earnings 
acts of war or terrorism may have an adverse effect on k s business 
acts of war or terrorism may have an adverse effect on the economy generally  and more specifically on k s business 
among various other risks  such occurrences have the potential to significantly decrease consumer spending on leisure products and activities  adversely impact k s ability to consummate future debt or equity financings and negatively affect k s ability to manufacture  source and deliver low cost goods in a timely manner 
k is subject to and may incur liabilities under various environmental laws 
k is subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects  such as discharges to air and water  as well as handling and disposal of and exposure to hazardous substances 
in that regard  k has been and could be subject to claims and inquiries related to alleged substances in k s products that may be subject to notice requirements or exposure limitations  particularly in california  which may result in fines and penalties 
k is also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability for cost and damages resulting from past disposals or other releases of hazardous substances 
for example  k may incur liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended  and similar laws  some of which impose strict  and in some cases  joint and several  liability for the cleanup of contamination resulting from past disposals of waste  including disposal at off site locations 
in addition  k has acquired pre existing businesses  such as rawlings  that have historical and ongoing operations  and k has limited information about the environmental condition of the properties of such companies 
it is possible that soil and groundwater contamination may exist on these or other of k s properties resulting from current or former operations 
k is currently aware of one matter involving off site waste disposal liability in south carolina and another matter involving soil contamination at a former facility in michigan for which k has accrued approximately million as of december  although k is not aware of any issues arising under current environmental laws that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on k s business  financial condition or results of operations  k cannot assure you that such matters will not have such an impact 
the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome may have a material adverse effect on k s manufacturing facilities in china and k s operations generally 
severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  is a disease that was first reported in november in the southern chinese province of guangdong  which is the province in which k s chinese manufacturing facility is located  the city of hanoi  vietnam  and hong kong 
sars subsequently spread to other parts of the world and continues to pose a health risk 
in  the outbreak of sars curtailed travel to and from certain countries for a period of time  and there can be no assurances that sars will not spread in sars could have a material adverse impact on k s manufacturing facilities in china and sourcing infrastructure in asia  and the significant spread of sars beyond asia could have an adverse impact on all of k s operations 
unfavorable weather can adversely affect k s sales 
sales of k s recreational products are strongly influenced by the weather 
poor snow conditions in the winter or summer conditions unfavorable to outdoor sports can adversely affect sales of important k products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect k s earnings and cash flows 
k manages its exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain firm purchase commitments and anticipated  but not yet committed purchases  by entering into some foreign currency forward contracts 
k s risk management objective is to reduce its exposure to the effects of changes in exchange rates on the cost of products sold over quarterly time horizons 
foreign currency exchange rate movements also affect k s competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors and may affect the profitability and pricing strategies of k as well 
k s foreign currency risk policies entail entering into foreign currency derivative instruments only to manage risk of currency fluctuations over a given period of time  not for speculative investments 
at december   k had foreign exchange contracts with maturities of within one year to exchange various foreign currencies to dollars in the aggregate amount of million 
considering both the anticipated cash flows from firm purchase commitments and anticipated purchases for the next quarter and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year end  a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies would not materially adversely affect expected first quarter earnings or cash flows 
this analysis is dependent on actual purchases during the next quarter occurring within of budgeted forecasts 
the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
in addition  it is unlikely currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen 
k is also exposed to interest rate risk in connection with its borrowings under the revolving bank credit facility and term loan which bear interest at floating rates based on london inter bank offered rate libor or the prime rate plus an applicable borrowing margin 
for the convertible subordinated debentures  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
as of december   k had million in principal amount of fixed rate debt represented by the convertible subordinated debentures and million of variable rate debt represented by borrowings under the revolving credit facility  term loan and foreign credit lines at a weighted average interest rate of at december  
based on the balance outstanding under the variable rate facilities as of december   an immediate change of one percentage point in the applicable interest rate would have caused an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
at december   up to million of variable rate borrowings were available under k s million revolving bank credit facility 
k may use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage its interest rate risks 
however  as a matter of policy  k does not enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   k had no such derivative financial instruments outstanding
