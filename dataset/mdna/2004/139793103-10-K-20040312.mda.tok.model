with a new leadership team in place and the continued dedication of its employees and its strong board of directors  the company is confident that it can remain focused on its core goals of being performance driven  community focused and dedicated to providing exceptional value to its customers and shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the reserve for loan losses  investment and intangible asset values  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o loan loss reserves the company records estimated loan loss reserves based on known problem loans and estimated deficiencies in the existing loan portfolio 
the reserve calculation takes into account historic write off trends and current market and economic conditions 
if economic conditions were to decline significantly or the financial condition of the bank s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves may be required 
o investments the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions and associated market values of investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
o valuation allowances the company assesses the need to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers anticipated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for the valuation allowance which  at this time  it deems not to be necessary 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
o purchase accounting for business combinations the company accounts for all business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  net assets acquired are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and the historical costs basis of individual assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect their fair value 
o goodwill goodwill is not amortized  but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis at the reporting unit level 
identified intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied value 
o impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including identified intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
such evaluations are based on undiscounted cash flow projections 
the disposal of long lived assets is measured based on the lower of the book or fair value less the costs to sell 
results of operations 
the company reported net income of  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a fully diluted per share basis  net income for   and was  
and  respectively 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between total interest income and total interest expense and is the company s principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is determined by the volume of interest earning assets  the level of rates earned on those assets  and the volume and cost of supporting funds 
net interest income increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase during the period is primarily due to increases in the average volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities as the bank has experienced internal growth 
the increase was negatively affected by a decline in market rates during rates dropped by basis points in july in  the federal reserve held interest rates steady for a majority of the year  but made one move in november that resulted in an additional basis point drop in the prime rate to 
in addition  during  the prime rate dropped from in january to in december with a decline in rates of at least basis points in every month of except july as the federal reserve made separate moves to reduce interest rates in efforts to stimulate the economy 
the company has felt the effects of these changes over an extended period of time due to the long term repricing or maturity dates of some of its assets and liabilities 
since the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with prime at a faster rate than the deposit portfolio  the declining rate environments have a negative effect on net interest spread and net interest margin 
net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest margin is the total of net interest income divided by average earning assets 
average earning assets in were million  up when compared to million for the net interest margin was in  a basis point decline from the net interest margin of 
net interest spread was and for and  respectively 
interest income increased in to million from million in this increase is primarily due to the growth in the bank s loan portfolio 
the average yield on interest earning assets for was  a decline of basis points from the yield of 
the decrease in average yield during was primarily attributable to the overall decline in market rates as explained above 
the average loan portfolio as a percentage of earning assets was in  up from the average balances of loans  which had yields of and for and  respectively  increased from million in to million in the average balances of federal funds and other short term investments decreased from million in to million in  and the average yield in this category dropped basis points from to over the same time period 
investment yield decreased from in to in this decrease reflects the results of the decline in market interest rates over the last three years as mortgage backed security mbs pay downs increased significantly when the borrowers making up the underlying securities moved to refinance their mortgages 
increases in mbs payment speeds accelerated the amortization of premiums associated with the purchases and dropped the investment yield 
interest expense increased in to million from the million recorded during this increase is primarily due to a significant increase in average interest bearing deposits  which went from million in to million in in addition  average borrowed funds increased year over year from million in to million in also  during the company incurred junior subordinated debt associated with two trust preferred securities offerings 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note subordinated debentures 
the income effects of increases in volume were significantly offset by declines in rates during the period 
the average rates on interest bearing deposits decreased from in to in the decrease in average rates during is reflective of the overall decrease in market rates offered during as compared to the previous year 
as previously mentioned  the bank s loan portfolio adjusted with prime at a faster rate than the deposit portfolio as a result of the federal reserve s actions to decrease interest rates 
much of the effect of the rapid rate declines of did not take place on the deposit portfolio until and in particular  the average rate on time deposits  which represented of all interest bearing liabilities during  dropped basis points in from in to in the following two tables set forth certain information regarding the company s yield on interest earning assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities and the component changes in net interest income 
the first table reflects the company s effective yield on earning assets and cost of funds 
yields and costs are computed by dividing income or expense for the year by the respective daily average asset or liability balance 
changes in net interest income from year to year can be explained in terms of fluctuations in volume and rate 
the second table presents further information on those changes

the provision for loan losses is the amount charged against earnings for the purpose of establishing an adequate allowance for probable loan losses 
loan losses are  in turn  charged to this allowance rather than being reported as a direct expense 
in and  amounts expensed as loan loss provisions were million and million  respectively 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is established based on management s estimate of the inherent risks associated with lending activities  estimated fair value of collateral  past experience and present indicators such as delinquency rates and current market conditions 
this estimate is regularly reviewed and modified  as necessary 
loans of  or more are subject to specific review for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
the allowance for loan losses was million and million on december  and  respectively  and represented approximately and of total loans outstanding on those dates 
the company experienced higher loan charge offs during when compared to the previous year 
management believes that this is due in part to a weakened economy and in part to some large credit issues identified in the second quarter of as a result of these credit issues  management engaged two independent credit review firms in the latter part of to perform a detailed analysis of the bank s loan portfolio 
as a result of the review  management identified loans during that period aggregating approximately million that were classified as a loss 
in addition  management significantly increased its internal loan watch list 
during  the company charged off an aggregate of million in loans  net of  in recoveries 
of that amount  million related to five business customer relationships 
during  the company charged off million in loans  net of  in recoveries 
also as a result of the loan review  the company effected certain changes to try to protect against such credit losses going forward  including procedural changes in the loan approval and credit review processes  changes in individual lending limits and centralization of the company s lending functions into one facility 
the company has also added a lender support area where all consumer loans are centrally underwritten and approved 
in addition  a new position was created  chief operating officer  to manage the lending and credit functions of the company and to run the day to day operations of the bank 
management has allocated the allowance for loan losses by category

other operating income was million and million for years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of 
the increase in other operating income for is primarily attributable to increases in fees associated with deposit accounts and a large increase in fees associated with the company s mortgage loan origination activities 
the large increase in fees associated with the mortgage loan origination activities was a direct result of attractive mortgage rates during and due to the lower interest rate environment 
mortgage loan origination fees increased from million during to million for fees associated with deposit accounts increased primarily as a result of the increased volume of average deposit accounts 
however  the total average deposit base increased from million in to million in service charges and fees have increased from million in to million in total service charges and fees as a percent of the average total deposit base dropped from

other operating expense represents the overhead expenses of the company 
management regularly monitors all categories of other operating expense in an attempt to improve productivity and operating performance 
other operating expense increased to million in from million in the increase in reflects a full year of expenses associated with the integration of the four additional branches in connection with the acquisition of first community corporation in january and three additional branches in connection with the acquisition of high street corporation in december at december  there were branches and the average number of full time equivalent employees was at december  there were branches and the average number of full time equivalent employees was specific categories of expenses and related causes for increases are as follows salary and employee benefits expense for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
increases were the result of additional personnel hired as new branches and departments were added or obtained through acquisition as discussed above 
in addition  during the company incurred million in severance expenses related to certain executive and senior officers who separated from the company 
commission expense increased from million in to million in because these commissions are driven by the underlying mortgage fee income  the increase   or  closely related to the increase in mortgage origination fees

furniture and equipment expense increased from million in to million in due to the increase in these assets needed for the new locations and general expansion 
other operating expenses increased from million in to million in the increases in other operating expenses from to included a increase in telephone expenses from  to  a increase in postage from  to  and a increase in public relations and advertising costs from  to  in addition  courier costs  or those costs associated with getting customer transactions to the bank s outside processing center  increased due to the additional branches being serviced by such couriers 
all such increases were a direct result of a full year of expense on the new branches or expansion of existing departments and were within management s expected ranges

throughout  the company recorded income tax expenses of million 
the company recorded an income tax expense of  in the decrease in income tax expense was primarily the result of the loss recorded in the third quarter of and an overall drop in net taxable income 
the third quarter loss reflects the significant charge offs  the increase in the allowance for loan losses and the related loan loss provision recorded during that period 
the overall effective rate dropped from in to in that rate reflects the impact of permanent differences such as nontaxable municipal bond interest on a smaller net income base

investment yield decreased from in to in this decrease reflects the results of the decline in market rates over the last two years 
this decrease was also attributable to a large number of federal agency bonds with high yields that were purchased at discounts in previous years being called during by the various agencies associated with the investment 
when those bonds were called  the associated discounts were taken into income as yield adjustments 
during  investments with a par value of million were called with  in discounts remaining at call date  all of which was taken into income as yield adjustments 
interest expense increased in to million from the million recorded during this increase is primarily due to a significant increase in average interest bearing deposits  which went from million in to million in in addition  average borrowed funds increased year over year from million in to million in the income effects of increases in volume were partially offset by declines in rates during these periods

liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
to ensure the company is positioned to meet immediate and future cash demands  management relies on internal analysis of its liquidity  knowledge of current economic and market trends and forecasts of future conditions

a secondary source of liquidity for the company comes from investing activities  principally the sales of  maturities of and cash flows from investment securities 
during and  due to the declining interest rate environment  the cash flow from mortgage backed securities accelerated as borrowers holding the underlying mortgages refinanced and certain securities with call features were called 
the cash received from these events  combined with maturities  amounted to million  compared to million in and million in as of december   the company had approximately  of investment securities that mature in months 
during  the company purchased million of investment securities to replace the securities sold  called or matured during the same period and to meet liquidity needs 
additional sources of liquidity are available to the bank through the federal reserve system and through membership in the federal home loan bank system 
as of december   the bank had a maximum borrowing capacity of million through the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
these funds can be made available with various maturities and interest rate structures 
borrowings cannot exceed twenty percent of total assets or twenty times the amount of federal home loan bank stock owned by the borrowing bank 
at december   the bank owned million worth of federal home loan bank stock or five percent of its outstanding advances of million 
borrowings are collateralized by a blanket lien by the federal home loan bank on the bank s qualifying assets

the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historic dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the rate of inflation has been relatively moderate over the past few years  however  the effect of inflation on interest rates can materially impact bank operations  which rely on the spread between the yield on earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowings as the major source of earnings 
operating costs  such as salaries and wages  occupancy and equipment costs  can also be negatively impacted by inflation 
risk factors you should consider the following material risk factors carefully before deciding to invest in the company s securities 
if any of the events described below occur  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock may decline  in which case the value of your investment may decline as well 
our results are impacted by the economic conditions of our principal operating regions our operations are concentrated throughout central and western north carolina 
as a result of this geographic concentration  our results may correlate to the economic conditions in these areas 
deterioration in economic conditions in any of these market areas  particularly in the industries on which these geographic areas depend  may adversely affect the quality of our loan portfolio and the demand for our products and services  and accordingly  our results of operations 
we are exposed to risks in connection with the loans we make a significant source of risk for us arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers  guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
during  the company was required to reclassify one large commercial borrowing relationship as a loss  which relationship consisted of three loans to a furniture accessories import company and its owner in the aggregate total of million 
the loan was included in the portfolio of high street corporation  which the company acquired in december we have underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for loan losses  that we believe are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying our loan portfolio 
such policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could adversely affect our results of operations 
during  as a result of the reclassification  management engaged two independent credit review firms to perform a detail analysis of the bank s loan portfolio 
as a result of the review  management significantly increased its internal loan watch list and effected certain changes to try to protect against such credit losses going forward  including procedural changes in the loan approval and credit review processes  changes in individual lending limits and centralization of the company s lending functions into one facility 
the company has also added a lender support area where all consumer loans are centrally underwritten and approved and created a new position of chief operating officer to manage the lending and credit functions of the company and to run the day to day operations of the bank 
we compete with larger companies for some of the same business the banking and financial services business in our market areas continues to be a competitive field and is becoming more competitive as a result of o changes in regulations  o changes in technology and product delivery systems  and o the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets  and our results of operations could be adversely affected by the nature or pace of change in competition 
we compete for loans  deposits and customers with various bank and non bank financial services providers  many of which are larger in total assets and capitalization  have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader array of financial services 
our trading volume has been low compared with larger banks the trading volume in the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market has been comparable to other similarly sized banks 
nevertheless  this trading is relatively low when compared with more seasoned companies listed on the nasdaq national market or other consolidated reporting systems or stock exchanges 
thus  the market in the company s common stock may be limited in scope relative to other companies 
we depend heavily on our key management personnel the company s success depends in part on its ability to retain key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel who have experience both in sophisticated banking matters and in operating a small to mid size bank 
competition for such personnel is strong in the banking industry and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel we require 
we expect to effectively compete in this area by offering financial packages that include incentive based compensation and the opportunity to join in the rewarding work of building a growing bank 
technological advances impact our business the banking industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to improving customer services  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
the company s future success will depend  in part  on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or successfully market such products and services to our customers 
government regulations may prevent or impair our ability to pay dividends  engage in acquisitions or operate in other ways current and future legislation and the policies established by federal and state regulatory authorities will affect our operations 
we are subject to supervision and periodic examination by the federal deposit insurance corporation and the north carolina state banking commission 
banking regulations  designed primarily for the protection of depositors  may limit our growth and the return to you  our investors  by restricting certain of our activities  such as o the payment of dividends to our shareholders  o possible mergers with or acquisitions of or by other institutions  o our desired investments  o loans and interest rates on loans  o interest rates paid on our deposits  o the possible expansion of our branch offices  and or o our ability to provide securities or trust services 
we also are subject to capitalization guidelines set forth in federal legislation  and could be subject to enforcement actions to the extent that we are found by regulatory examiners to be under capitalized 
we cannot predict what changes  if any  will be made to existing federal and state legislation and regulations or the effect that such changes may have on our future business and earnings prospects 
the cost of compliance with regulatory requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
there are potential risks associated with future acquisitions we intend to continue to explore expanding our branch system through selective acquisitions of existing banks or bank branches in the research triangle area and other north carolina markets 
we cannot say with any certainty that we will be able to consummate  or if consummated  successfully integrate  future acquisitions  or that we will not incur disruptions or unexpected expenses in integrating such acquisitions 
in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions that would bolster our ability to cater to the small business  individual and residential lending markets in north carolina 
in attempting to make such acquisitions  we anticipate competing with other financial institutions  many of which have greater financial and operational resources 
in addition  since the consideration for an acquired bank or branch may involve cash  notes or the issuance of shares of common stock  existing shareholders could experience dilution in the value of their shares of our common stock in connection with such acquisitions 
any given acquisition  if and when consummated  may adversely affect our results of operations or overall financial condition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company hopes to reach its strategic financial objectives through the effective management of market risk 
like many financial institutions  the company s most significant market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company s primary goal in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the effect that changes in interest rates have on interest income and expense 
this is accomplished through the active management of asset and liability portfolios  which includes the strategic pricing of asset and liability accounts and ensuring a proper maturity combination of assets and liabilities 
the goal of these activities is the development of maturity and repricing opportunities in the company s portfolios of assets and liabilities that will produce consistent net interest income during periods of changing interest rates 
the company s asset liability committee alco  made up of members of management and the board  monitors loan  investment  and liability portfolios to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk 
these portfolios are analyzed to ensure proper fixed and variable rate mixes under several interest rate scenarios 
the asset liability management process is intended to accomplish relatively stable net interest margins and assure liquidity by coordinating the amounts  maturities  or repricing opportunities of earning assets  deposits  and borrowed funds 
the alco has the responsibility to determine and achieve the most appropriate volume and combination of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and ensure an adequate level of liquidity and capital  within the context of corporate performance objectives 
the alco also sets policy guidelines and establishes long term strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity 
the alco meets regularly to review the company s interest rate risk and liquidity positions in relation to present and prospective market and business conditions  and adopts balance sheet management strategies intended to ensure that the potential impact of earnings and liquidity as a result of fluctuations in interest rates is within acceptable guidelines 
in  the bank began using financial instruments  commonly known as derivatives  to manage various financial risks 
the instruments consist of interest rate swaps and swaptions 
a derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows  and therefore its value  by reference to an underlying instrument  index  or referenced interest rate 
the bank uses derivatives to hedge its interest bearing liabilities 
these hedges resulted in a net increase in net interest income of  in derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as notional amounts 
notional amounts only provide the basis for calculating payments between counterparties and do not represent amounts to be exchanged between parties and are not a measure of financial risk 
on december   the bank had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling million 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative financial instruments for additional information 
as a financial institution  most of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
this differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies balance sheets  which are comprised primarily of fixed assets or inventories 
movements in interest rates and actions of the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb to regulate the availability and cost of credit have a greater effect on a financial institution s profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services 
through its balance sheet management function  which is monitored by the alco  the company is positioned to respond to changing needs for liquidity  changes in interest rates and inflationary trends 
the company utilizes an outside asset liability management advisory firm to help management evaluate interest rate risk and develop asset liability management strategies 
one tool used is a computer simulation model which projects the company s performance under different interest rate scenarios 
analyses are prepared quarterly which evaluate the company s performance in a base strategy which reflects the company s and operating plan 
three interest rate scenarios flat  rising and declining are applied to the base strategy to determine the effect of changing interest rates on net interest income 
the december  analysis of the company indicates that interest rate risk exposure over a twelve month time horizon is within the guidelines established by the board of directors 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is illustrated in the following table 
the table reflects rate sensitive positions at december   and is not necessarily indicative of positions on other dates 
the carrying amounts of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are presented in the periods in which they next reprice to market rates or mature and are aggregated to show the interest rate sensitivity gap 
to reflect anticipated prepayments  certain asset and liability categories are shown in the table using estimated cash flows rather than contractual cash flows 
the table does not reflect the impact of hedging strategies

in the rising rate scenario  which contemplates a basis point increase in interest rates over a twelve month period  the company is expected to see its annualized net interest income improve by million  or 
conversely  the company will see a decline in net interest income of million  or  if rates decline basis points  as is contemplated in the declining rate scenario
