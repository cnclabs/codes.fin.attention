item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading biotechnology company primarily focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of high quality oncology products that both extend life and improve the quality of life for cancer patients worldwide 
our flagship product  tarceva tm erlotinib  is an oral  once a day  small molecule inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor  or her egfr 
tarceva tm is the first egfr inhibitor  and the first non chemotherapy agent  to demonstrate a survival benefit in advanced non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc  and also in pancreatic cancer  two forms of cancer widely recognized as amongst the toughest treatment challenges facing oncologists 
on november   after a review lasting only three and a half months  the us food and drug administration  or fda  approved our new drug application  or nda  for monotherapy tarceva tm use in the treatment of all nsclc patients who have failed prior chemotherapy 
we  along with our partner genentech  inc launched tarceva tm on november   two business days following approval  shortly prior to which we and genentech announced pricing for the drug in the united states 
we intend to file a supplemental nda  or snda  for the treatment of front line pancreatic cancer patients in combination with gemcitabine in fiscal in addition  our partner  roche  has completed a regulatory filing under the centralized process in the european union  or eu  for tarceva tm in nsclc 
we anticipate that roche will gain approval for the drug in the second half of calendar beyond tarceva tm  we have a balanced pipeline of oncology drug candidates that includes signal transduction inhibitors  apoptosis also know as programmed cell death inducers and a next generation cytotoxic chemotherapy agent 
we have established a core commercial organization  which includes approximately sales representatives and managers covering the major territories in the united states 
we market and promote novantrone r mitoxantrone concentrate for injection for approved oncology indications in the united states  and we market and distribute gelclair r in north america  a bioadherent oral gel for the relief of pain associated with oral mucositis  a frequent side effect of chemotherapy 
we also have a diabetes and obesity subsidiary  prosidion limited  which is based in the united kingdom 
prosidion s lead clinical candidate  psn  an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase iv  or dp iv  is in phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of type diabetes 
psn was acquired by prosidion from probiodrug ag  a german company  in a transaction which closed in july behind psn  prosidion has an emerging pipeline of diabetes and obesity drug candidates 
our objective going forward is to build upon tarceva tm s significant market potential and to capitalize on the experienced management team and the comprehensive set of capabilities from discovery to commercialization that we have established over the last several years in order to create a premier biotechnology organization and drive value creation for our stockholders 
to accomplish this  we intend to maximize tarceva tm s value by supporting an effective launch in the united states  a timely registration and effective launch in the eu and japan and an effective product growth strategy  establish our position as a premier oncology franchise by advancing our pipeline  reinforcing our commercial presence  validating our research capabilities and actively pursuing in licensing and acquisition opportunities  and diversify our business through continued investment in prosidion to grow a second business unit focused on diabetes and obesity in order to help drive long term growth 
significant events tarceva tm on november   we announced that the fda approved our nda for monotherapy tarceva tm use in the treatment of all nsclc patients who have failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen 
tarceva tm met its primary endpoint of improving overall survival and its key secondary endpoints of progression free survival and objective tumor response rate in a patient randomized  double blinded placebo controlled phase iii trial  or the br 
study 
the study compared tarceva tm to placebo in the treatment of patients with advanced nsclc following the failure of first or second line chemotherapy 
the data demonstrates a improvement in median survival and a improvement in the one year survival rate relative to placebo 
the results revealed a survival benefit in essentially all subsets of patients examined  including males  smokers and patients with squamous cell carcinoma histology subsets that  consistent with previous studies with egfr inhibitors  had a relatively low rate of tumor response in our study  as well as females  non smokers and patients with adenocarcinoma subsets with higher rates of tumor response 
we believe that these results are particularly noteworthy in that they demonstrate a meaningful  broad based clinical benefit in a very advanced population of lung cancer patients and that these results form the basis for our recent approval 
the safety profile observed in the br 
study was relatively benign compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy and was consistent with that seen in prior tarceva tm studies with of patients receiving tarceva tm exhibiting rash versus in the placebo group and of patients receiving tarceva tm experiencing diarrhea versus for placebo 
in this large placebo controlled study  severe pulmonary events  including potential cases of interstitial lung disease  were infrequent and generally equally distributed between the tarceva tm and placebo arms 
we believe that this combination of survival benefit with a relatively benign side effect profile positions tarceva tm as a potentially important treatment option for oncologists treating advanced nsclc patients who have failed front line chemotherapy 
in september  we announced that tarceva tm also met its primary endpoint of improving overall survival in a patient randomized  double blind placebo controlled phase iii trial in front line pancreatic cancer patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease 
the trial compared a combination of tarceva tm and the chemotherapy agent gemcitabine with gemcitabine plus placebo 
the data demonstrates a improvement in overall survival a hazard ratio of and p value of for the tarceva tm arm compared to the placebo arm 
the results were noteworthy in that tarceva tm was used at a lower dose mg than was used in our br 
study for the majority of patients treated in the study and tarceva tm was used in combination with a chemotherapy agent 
we believe that the data demonstrates that tarceva tm is likely to have broad utility beyond the initial lung cancer indication 
in connection with the further development and commercialization of tarceva tm  we recently entered into agreements with genentech with respect to promotion  marketing and manufacturing responsibilities for tarceva tm in the us market 
genentech will have the lead responsibility for the marketing and promotion of tarceva tm in the united states 
however  we will co promote the product in the field by providing at least of the combined us sales force 
we also have responsibility for the manufacturing and supply of tarceva tm in the united states  and we believe we have a supply chain in place with inventory on hand to support launch of the product 
we  along with our supply chain of third party providers  have sufficient inventory for the launch of the product 
tarceva tm is priced to wholesalers at  per day supply of the mg tablets  and is also available in mg and mg tablet strengths 
with the iressa r price increase effective november  tarceva tm is priced at less than a premium to the competitor s product 
the successful execution of a strategy to expand tarceva tm indications and grow the product post launch is our clear priority 
we intend to broaden the use of tarceva tm to earlier stage lung cancer patients  both in the first line and adjuvant settings 
the first part of this strategy has been initiated with an ongoing randomized phase ii trial evaluating monotherapy tarceva tm against chemotherapy in patients who have received no prior chemotherapy and have poor performance status 
public offering on november   subsequent to the end of fiscal  we concluded a public offering of million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
gross proceeds totaled million with net proceeds of approximately million after all related fees 
in addition  on november   underwriters associated with this offering exercised their over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
gross proceeds from the exercise of the over allotment option totaled million with net proceeds of approximately million 
we believe that the proceeds from this offering together with existing cash resources and projected cashflows from tarceva tm will be sufficient to execute our strategy going forward 
redemption of convertible senior subordinated notes on june   we exercised the redemption option for our senior convertible subordinated notes due that we issued in february and called for the full redemption of the outstanding million of the notes 
as expected  all of the noteholders converted their notes into shares of our common stock prior to the redemption date of july  as a result of these conversions  in july  we reduced our long term debt by million and issued million shares of our common stock 
we also paid the remaining portion of the guaranteed interest of million to the noteholders 
see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
impairment of intangible asset in october  we announced that it will be necessary to record an impairment charge as of september  related to our intangible asset for the exclusive distribution rights to the marketed product  gelclair r  in north america 
we determined that an impairment charge of approximately million  which represented the full unamortized balance of the gelclair r intangible asset  was necessary as of september  the impairment charge resulted from both the recent discontinuance of discussions with a replacement dental partner and slower than originally expected sales growth in the oncology marketplace following the re launch of the product in october prosidion s asset acquisition we consider expansion into a second disease area to be an important part of our strategy for long term value creation 
to this end  on july   prosidion acquired from probiodrug  its type diabetes phase ii clinical candidate  psn formerly p  and its associated intellectual property estate 
psn is an oral  small molecule inhibitor of dp iv  which is recognized as an important target in diabetes 
in addition to composition of matter claims for psn  the acquired intellectual property estate includes issued us method of use claims that have been non exclusively licensed to novartis pharma ag and merck co  inc  among others  for milestones and royalties 
prosidion also anticipates initiating clinical trials for two diabetes candidates  psn a glucokinase activator and psn a glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor  in the first half of calendar see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
consolidation of our oncology operations on august   we announced to our employees a plan to consolidate our uk based oncology research and development activities into our new york locations by november  this decision was based on the need to prioritize the expansion of our commercial operation infrastructure and increase our level of investment in both translational research and our diabetes and obesity subsidiary  prosidion 
this consolidation primarily affects our oxford facility where the consolidation has resulted in the layoff of employees 
upon the consolidation  the only operations remaining at the oxford facility are those related to our international clinical trials group and prosidion 
as a result of this decision  we recorded a charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to termination benefits and the acceleration of depreciation on certain leasehold improvements at the oxford facility 
see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
aptosyn r on june   we announced that  as we had expected  the phase iii study of aptosyn r exislund in combination with taxotere r docetaxal did not meet its primary endpoint of improving overall survival in patients with advanced nsclc 
the trial also did not meet its secondary endpoints of improvement in one year survival  progression free survival and response rate 
survival in the aptosyn r plus taxotere r arm of the study was essentially indistinguishable from the taxotere r plus placebo arm 
although the further development of aptosyn r is unlikely  we believe that the more potent follow on molecule  osi  warrants continued development 
we acquired both aptosyn r and osi in june as part of the acquisition of cell pathways  inc provision for excess gelclair r inventory during fiscal  we recorded total charges of million relating to obsolete gelclair r inventory that we deemed in excess of forecasted demand 
this excess inventory relates to the substantial inventory obtained from the cell pathways acquisition  the required purchase commitments that we assumed in the cell pathways acquisition and the current low demand for the product 
we purchased an additional million of inventory during the fourth quarter of fiscal based upon the required purchase commitments 
we are required to purchase another million of inventory by december  and will be required to purchase an additional million in as of september   we have accrued a charge of million related to the remaining and purchase commitments that we have determined to be in excess of forecasted demand 
in addition  we recorded a charge of million for excess inventory on hand during fiscal in late october  we exercised our right to terminate our agreement with helsinn healthcare sa  the supplier of the product 
under the terms of the agreement  helsinn has the option to purchase any and all of our inventory at cost plus and if helsinn does not elect to purchase our inventory  we are permitted to continue to sell such inventory 
we are currently negotiating a new agreement with helsinn 
financial expectations for fiscal in terms of fiscal guidance  we are not currently providing tarceva tm specific revenue guidance as per our agreement with genentech 
tarceva tm was launched in late november and therefore we will only have ten months of sales for our fiscal in order to maximize tarceva tm s value with an effective launch and product growth strategy in the united states  we  along with our partner  genentech  expect to incur significant costs related to the launch of tarceva tm 
as a result of the significant investment required with a product launch  we believe that our share of the co promotion split from the sale of tarceva tm in the united states may not be profitable in the near term 
we currently estimate that our total fiscal sales commissions and gelclair r product sales will be between million and million 
in terms of operating expenses  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease and be in the range of million to million  primarily due to our share of the fiscal commercial costs associated with tarceva tm that are expected to be offset against tarceva tm derived revenue in the co promotion split 
we expect to maintain our current level of r d between million to million 
we expect that amortization expense will decrease to approximately million as a result of the impairment of the gelclair r asset in the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect total operating expenses to be approximately million in fiscal further we expect interest expense to decrease to approximately million as a result of the conversion in july of the senior subordinated convertible notes 
actual results could differ materially and will depend on  among other things  the continuing growth of our currently marketed products  developments with competitive products  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches  foreign exchange rates  possible regulatory actions  and the impact of state  federal  and foreign government pricing and reimbursement measures 
this guidance excludes material unusual items and in process research and development charges that we may report 
we currently expect to record a charge in either the first or second quarter of fiscal for rental obligations relating to the portion of our uk facilities that we will vacate as a result of our decision to consolidate our uk based oncology research and development activities into our new york facilities 
we are currently not aware of any other material unusual charges that will occur in fiscal except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the federal securities laws  we undertake no duty to update these forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ significantly from our estimates and the estimated amounts could differ significantly under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales commissions from novantrone r on net oncology sales are recognized in the period the sales occur based on the estimated split between oncology sales and multiple sclerosis sales  as determined on a quarterly basis by an external third party 
the split between oncology and multiple sclerosis sales is subject to further adjustment based on the parties final review in the subsequent quarter 
based on past experience  we do not believe these adjustments  if any  will be significant to the consolidated financial statements 
given the limited sales history of gelclair r  we at this time defer the recognition of revenue on product shipments of gelclair r to wholesale customers until such time as the product is sold from the wholesale customer to the retail and non retail outlets 
for each reporting period  we monitor shipments from wholesale customers to pharmacies and hospitals and wholesale customers reorder history based on data from an external third party 
our revenue recognition policies for all nonrefundable upfront license fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with the guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
in addition  we follow the provisions of emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables for multiple element revenue arrangements entered into or materially amended after june  our most significant application of these policies  to date  is the million in upfront fees received from genentech and roche in january  which were originally being recognized evenly over the expected three year term of our required research and development efforts under the terms of the agreement 
a change in the expected term impacts the period over which the remaining deferred revenue is recognized 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the expected term was changed from three years to four years to reflect the revised estimated timing of our research and development commitment for tarceva tm under the alliance 
the revision was a result of a review of the research data available  developments in the her egfr targeted therapy market and the involved parties revised projections for the clinical development plan 
further  as a result of the amendment to the osi genentech agreement in june  the remaining unearned upfront fee from genentech of approximately million will be recognized in accordance with eitf  as discussed below 
as the roche agreement was not modified or amended subsequent to its original execution  the unearned upfront fee from roche continues to be recognized over the revised term and will be fully recognized as of december  in connection with our collaboration with genentech  genentech will recognize all us sales of tarceva tm 
we will recognize revenues and losses from our alliance with genentech  which will consist of our share of the pretax profits loss generated from the sales of tarceva tm in the united states 
we also will recognize manufacturing revenue from the sale of inventory to genentech for commercial sales of tarceva tm in the united states and partial reimbursement from genentech of our tarceva tm related commercial expenses 
we will receive royalties on sales of tarceva tm outside of the united states by roche and up to million in non refundable milestone payments from genentech and roche upon the achievement of certain milestones relating to regulatory submissions and approval  of which million has been received 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized million in milestone revenues from our partner roche based upon the emea s notice of acceptance for filing and review of our nda for the use of tarceva tm as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced nsclc patients who have failed at least one chemotherapy regimen 
milestone payments from roche are accounted for such that revenue related to each payment be recognized over the entire contract performance period  but not prior to the removal of the contingencies for each milestone 
once a contingency is removed and the customer is obligated to make a payment  the costs of the effort that has been incurred to date is divided by the total expected research and development costs and revenue is recognized for that milestone to the extent of the ratio of performance to date  less revenue previously recognized 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also received a million milestone payment from genentech based upon the fda s notice of acceptance for filing and review of our nda for the use of tarceva tm as a monotherapy for the treatment of nsclc patients who have failed at least one chemotherapy regimen 
as a result of the amendment to the osi genentech agreement in june  we were required to account for the genentech milestone received and the remaining unearned upfront fee of approximately million  in accordance with eitf milestones received from genentech and the remaining unearned upfront fee will be recognized over the term of the manufacturing and supply agreement between genentech and us 
this accounting resulted from the inability to determine the fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement as required by eitf as a result  the milestones are attributed to the last item delivered under the manufacturing and supply agreement 
we will recognize such deferred revenue over the term of the manufacturing and supply agreement based on the lesser of the ratio of units sold by genentech to total expected units or the cumulative straight line basis 
this estimate of expected unit sales will be adjusted periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there could be a significant change in such estimate 
inventory our current inventory consists solely of gelclair r inventory and is stated at the lower of cost or market value  and our inventory costs are determined by the first in  first out method 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  and inventory in excess of expected requirements 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off 
provisions for excess or expired inventory are primarily based on our estimates of forecasted sales levels 
during the quarter ended march   we recorded a provision of million for obsolete inventory that we considered to be in excess of forecasted future demand based on the expiration date of the product on hand 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional provision of million in relation to inventory on hand and and purchase commitments with helsinn that we deemed in excess of forecasted demand  based on the expiration date of the product 
this additional provision related to million of inventory on hand and million of purchase commitments 
this excess inventory relates to the inventory obtained from cell pathways and the required purchase commitments that we assumed in the cell pathways acquisition and the current low demand for the product 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
to date  all costs associated with the manufacturing of tarceva tm have been included in research and development expenses when incurred 
effective november   the date on which we received approval from the fda for tarceva tm  we began to capitalize in inventory the cost of manufacturing tarceva tm for commercial sale and will expense such cost as cost of goods sold at the time of sale 
however  as we sell existing inventory that was previously expensed  we will reflect product sales with no corresponding cost of goods sold for a period of time 
although it is currently impossible to project demand for tarceva tm due to lack of historical experience  we believe we have sufficient inventory to supply our partner  genentech  with the product for a significant period 
as we began to package our bulk inventory  we capitalized the cost of packaging and labeling such inventory 
therefore  we anticipate that our cost of sales of tarceva tm to our partner  genentech  will fluctuate in fiscal from quarter to quarter 
accruals for clinical research organization and clinical site costs we make estimates of costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced in relation to external clinical research organizations  or cros  and clinical site costs 
we analyze the progress of clinical trials  including levels of patient enrollment  invoices received and contracted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
goodwill and other long lived assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and certain other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not amortized into results of operations but instead are reviewed for impairment at least annually and written down  and charged to results of operations in periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain other intangibles is more than their implied fair value 
we completed our annual impairment review of goodwill during the first quarter of fiscal and determined that no impairment charge was required 
our identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization 
sfas no 
requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
we review our intangibles with determinable lives and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
our two most significant intangible assets are our rights to novantrone r and gelclair r  and therefore  we continually monitor sales activity and market and regulatory conditions for these products for the existence of any impairment indicators 
in october  we determined that it was necessary to record an impairment charge as of september  related to our intangible asset for exclusive distribution rights to the marketed product  gelclair r  in north america 
the impairment charge resulted from both the recent discontinuance of discussions with a replacement dental partner and slower than originally expected sales growth in the oncology marketplace following the re launch of the product in october in accordance with sfas no 
 these events indicated that the carrying value of the gelclair r intangible should be tested for recoverability 
the revised forecast indicated a period of continuing losses associated with the sales and distribution of gelclair r 
in performing such recoverability test we determined that the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows directly related to the gelclair r asset was less than the carrying value of the gelclair r asset 
as a result  an impairment charge was required 
the amount of the impairment charge represents the difference between the fair value of the intangible asset and its associated carrying value 
we calculated the fair value of the intangible asset using discounted cash flows 
the discounted cash flows calculation was made utilizing various assumptions and estimates regarding future revenues and expenses  cash flow and discount rates 
based on these calculations  we determined that an impairment charge of million  which represented the full unamortized balance of the gelclair r intangible asset  was necessary as of september  in the future  events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain other intangibles with determinable lives and other long lived assets are impaired which may result in an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal results of operations our fiscal net loss of million increased million compared to our fiscal net loss of million 
the fiscal net loss included an in process r d charge of million in connection with the acquisition of certain assets of probiodrug by prosidion  a charge of million related to the impairment of the gelclair r intangible asset and a charge of million for excess inventory 
the fiscal net loss included an in process r d charge of million in connection with the acquisition of cell pathways 
revenues year ended september  in thousands change sales commissions and product sales    license  milestone and other revenues    collaborative revenues   total revenues    revenues for fiscal were primarily comprised of sales commissions as compared to sales commissions and collaborative revenues for fiscal this shift reflects our transition from a business centered on funded collaborative programs to one of generating our own product revenues in conjunction with the launch of tarceva tm 
sales commissions and product sales we began recording novantrone r sales commissions upon the execution of our co promotion agreement with an affiliate of serono  sa in march sales commissions for fiscal of million were million higher than the fiscal sales commissions of million 
the increase was primarily due to a full months of sales commissions in fiscal compared to six and a half months of sales commissions in fiscal the increase was also due in part to net oncology sales exceeding a contractual threshold limit in both the first and fourth quarters of fiscal  thus resulting in higher effective commissions 
the commission rate will revert back to the base commission rate effective with the new calendar year 
we began recording gelclair r product sales upon the close of our acquisition of cell pathways in june net product sales for fiscal were million compared to  for fiscal the increase was due to a full months of sales in fiscal compared to three and a half months of sales in fiscal we previously had a marketing agreement with john o 
butler company  under which butler marketed gelclair r to the dental market 
in april  we agreed with butler to terminate this agreement 
in late october  we exercised our right to terminate our distribution agreement with helsinn upon days notice 
under the terms of the agreement  helsinn has the option to purchase any and all of our inventory at cost plus following termination and if helsinn does not elect to purchase our inventory  we are permitted to continue to sell such inventory 
we are currently negotiating a new agreement with helsinn 
license  milestone and other revenues license revenues consist principally of the recognition of the million upfront fees from genentech and roche over the expected term of the collaboration 
we recognized million and million in license revenue in fiscal and  respectively  relating to these upfront fees 
license fees in fiscal also included recognition of the remaining  of the million upfront fee received from tanabe seiyaku co  ltd 
relating to the research collaboration that expired on october  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized million in milestone revenues from our partner roche based upon the emea s notice of acceptance for filing and review of our nda for the use of tarceva tm as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced nsclc patients who have failed at least one chemotherapy regimen 
milestone payments from roche are accounted for such that revenue related to each payment be recognized over the entire contract performance period  but not prior to the removal of the contingencies for each milestone 
once a contingency is removed and the customer is obligated to make a payment  the costs of the effort that has been incurred to date is divided by the total expected research and development costs and revenue is recognized for that milestone to the extent of the ratio of performance to date  less revenue previously recognized 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also received a million milestone payment from genentech based upon the fda s notice of acceptance for filing and review of our nda for the use of tarceva tm as a monotherapy for the treatment of nsclc patients who have failed at least one chemotherapy regimen 
as a result of the amendment to the osi genentech agreement in june  we were required to account for the genentech milestone received and the remaining unearned upfront fee of approximately million  in accordance with eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
milestones received from genentech and the remaining unearned upfront fee will be recognized over the term of the manufacturing and supply agreement between genentech and us 
this accounting resulted from the inability to determine the fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement as required by eitf as a result  the milestones are attributed to the last item delivered under the manufacturing and supply agreement 
we will recognize such deferred revenue over the term of the manufacturing and supply agreement based on the lesser of the ratio of units sold by genentech to total expected units or the cumulative straight line basis 
this estimate of expected unit sales will be adjusted periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there could be a significant change in such estimate 
additional milestone payments will be paid by genentech and roche upon registration of tarceva tm in the united states and the european union  respectively  and upon successful filing and registration of tarceva tm in japan 
further milestones are also due upon the successful filing and approval of tarceva tm in a second oncology indication and upon the approval of the first two adjuvant oncology indications in the united states  european union and japan 
collaborative revenues collaborative program revenues represent funding arrangements for research and development in the field of biotechnology and are recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the contracts and the related development activities undertaken 
there were no collaborative program revenues in fiscal due to the completion of our remaining collaborations with anaderm research corporation in march and tanabe in october expenses year ended september  in thousands change cost of product sales   research and development    acquired in process r d    selling  general and administrative    impairment of intangible asset   amortization of intangibles    cost of product sales cost of product sales relate to sales of gelclair r and also includes a provision for obsolete inventory of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we purchased million of gelclair r inventory based upon the purchase commitments for gelclair r under our agreement with helsinn that we assumed in the cell pathways acquisition 
we are obligated to purchase an additional million of inventory by december  and an additional million in during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a provision of million for obsolete inventory that we considered to be in excess of forecasted future demand based on the expiration date of the product on hand 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional provision of million in relation to inventory on hand and and purchase commitments with helsinn that we deemed in forecasted demand  based on the expiration date of the product 
this additional provision related to million of inventory on hand and million of purchase commitments 
this excess inventory relates to the inventory obtained from the cell pathways acquisition and the required purchase commitments that we assumed in the cell pathways acquisition and the current low demand for the product 
excluding the provision for obsolete inventory  cost of product sales were  and  in fiscal and  respectively  or approximately one third of product sales 
research development on november   our flagship product  tarceva tm  was approved by the fda as a monotherapy for the treatment of all nsclc patients who have failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen and has successfully completed a phase iii trial for pancreatic cancer 
tarceva tm is also the subject of an extensive collaborative clinical program encompassing over additional clinical trials 
we also have additional drug candidates in various stages of clinical development 
osi is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that acts as a potent co inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases c kit and vegfr  and is designed to target both cancer cell proliferation and blood vessel growth angiogenesis in selected tumors 
osi is currently in pre clinical development and we anticipate initiating a clinical program in the first half of calendar osi l is a liposomal formulation of tsi  which was licensed from glaxosmithkline plc and acquired by us as part of the acquisition of gilead s sciences  inc s oncology business 
we are developing osi l primarily for gastrointestinal tract cancers 
the saands platform that we acquired from cell pathways in june consisted of two clinical candidates  aptosyn r and osi the phase iii study of aptosyn r exislund in combination with taxotere r  did not meet its primary endpoint of improving overall survival in patients with advanced nsclc 
the trial also did not meet its secondary endpoints of improvement in one year survival  progression free survival and response rate 
although we have halted the further development of aptosyn r  we believe that the more potent follow on molecule  osi  warrants continued development 
in february  we expanded an ongoing phase i dose escalating and pharmacokinetic trial of osi in patients with advanced solid tumors 
in july  cell pathways commenced a phase ii trial of osi in the non cancerous area of inflammatory bowel disease at doses we consider to be sub optimal 
we recently received inconclusive results from this study  which we need to further analyze in order to determine how best to proceed with this compound in this indication 
the lead clinical candidate of our diabetes and obesity subsidiary  prosidion is psn  an inhibitor of dp iv  which is in phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of type diabetes 
psn was acquired by prosidion from probiodrug in a transaction which closed in july behind psn  prosidion has an emerging pipeline of diabetes and obesity drug candidates 
three other oncology candidates cp  cp  and cp  for which we are entitled to royalties  are gene targeted therapies currently being developed by pfizer inc and require no further research and development investment by us 
we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline crucial to the long term approval process 
we manage our overall research  development and in licensing efforts in a manner designed to generate a constant flow of clinical candidates into development to offset both the advancement of products to the market and the anticipated attrition rate of drug candidates that fail in clinical trials or are terminated for business reasons 
the table below summarizes the typical duration of each phase of clinical development and the typical cumulative probabilities of success for approval of drug candidates entering clinical development 
the numbers are based upon industry survey data for small molecule drugs estimated cumulative development phase estimated completion time probability of success phase i years phase ii years phase iii years registration months the tufts center for the study of drug development estimates that the average cost to develop a new prescription drug is million 
the actual probability of success for each drug candidate and clinical program will be impacted by a variety of factors  including the quality of the molecule  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition and commercial viability 
because we manage our pipeline in a dynamic manner  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments assigned to any one program prior to the phase iii stage of development  or to the future cash inflows from these programs 
for fiscal  we invested a total of million in research and million in pre clinical and clinical development 
for fiscal  we invested a total of million in research and million in pre clinical and clinical development 
we consider this level of investment suitable to sustain one major late stage clinical program and two to four earlier stage clinical programs at any time and we manage our overall research and development investments toward this level of activity 
the marginal increase in the research and development expense for fiscal was primarily due to costs associated with the clinical development of our pipeline  including increases in osi l  osi  osi and aptosyn r of million  as well as an increased investment in prosidion of million 
prosidion s research and development expenses for fiscal were million compared to expenses of million in fiscal included in prosidion s research and development expenses in fiscal is a million termination fee paid in cash and prosidion stock to tanabe relating to a termination agreement with tanabe  whereby prosidion obtained the rights to certain patents developed under the collaboration 
tanabe retained the rights to develop and commercialize  in certain asian territories  compounds covered by such patents 
prosidion is also required to make payments to tanabe upon the achievement of certain milestones 
also included in research and development expense for fiscal is million relating to termination benefits paid to employees and million relating to the acceleration of certain leasehold improvements  in connection with our decision to consolidate our uk based oncology research and development activities into our new york locations 
these increases to research and development expense in fiscal were offset by a decrease in the development expense of tarceva tm of million due to the completion of the phase iii trials in nsclc and pancreatic cancer  as well as decreased investment in the osi and osi programs of approximately million 
in fiscal  we decided to halt the further development of osi  since we were unable to differentiate the program from a current competitor s product  and osi  since we were unable to overcome certain toxicity issues 
the significant perceived market potential for tarceva tm resulted in the osi genentech roche alliance committing to a large and comprehensive global development plan for the candidate 
the global development plan has included major phase iii clinical trials in lung and pancreatic cancers and a large number of earlier stage trials in a variety of disease settings 
the alliance partners have initially committed to invest a combined million in the global development plan to be shared equally by the three parties 
we have made additional research and development investments outside of the global development plan with the consent of the other parties 
as of september   we have invested in excess of million in the development of tarceva tm since the return of the full rights to the product from pfizer in june  representing our share of the costs incurred to date in the tripartite global development plan and additional investments outside the plan 
our research and development expenses for tarceva tm incurred for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal to date we have spent approximately of our commitment under the plan  we expect to continue our investment in tarceva tm  along with our partners  to support its continued development and commercial growth beyond the original commitment 
acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of certain assets from probiodrug by prosidion in july  we recorded an in process r d charge of million in fiscal  representing the estimated fair value of the acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the in process r d charge was assigned to the development project  psn  an oral  small molecule inhibitor of dp iv  which is recognized as an important target in diabetes 
in connection with the acquisition of cell pathways in june  we recorded an in process r d charge of million during fiscal  representing the estimated fair value of the acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the in process r d charge was assigned to the two development projects and related technology platform and patent estate  aptosyn r million and osi million based on their value on the date of the acquisition 
selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million during fiscal reflects increased investment in our commercial infrastructure as we prepared for the launch of our flagship product  tarceva tm  as well as our continued investment in supporting our other commercial and pipeline programs 
for fiscal  our commercial operation expenses increased approximately million compared to fiscal the most significant component of our investment has been commercialization and marketing costs relating to tarceva tm which are shared with genentech in accordance with the terms of our collaboration 
the increase in commercial cost was also due to additional management and personnel relating to the establishment of commercial operations to support tarceva tm  gelclair r and novantrone r  as well as an additional two quarters of maintenance fees paid to serono relating to novantrone r 
also included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were exit costs of million relating to remaining rental obligations for our horsham  pennsylvania and uniondale  new york facilities  termination benefits relating to the consolidation of our uk based oncology research and development activities and the acceleration of depreciation of certain equipment and leasehold improvements at our oxford and uniondale facilities 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were fees paid to serono for transition services provided by them after our acquisition of the novatrone r rights  fees paid to celgene corporation in connection with our recovery of the full rights to market and distribute gelclair tm in north america  and subcontracting expenses related to our transitional arrangement with a contract sales organization as we were building our commercial infrastructure 
our sales and marketing infrastructure is currently comprised of approximately sales  marketing  medical affairs  commercial planning and support personnel  which includes approximately sales representative and managers covering the major territories in the united states 
impairment of intangible asset in connection with our acquisition of cell pathways  we assumed the exclusive rights to market and distribute gelclair r in north america 
we recorded an identifiable intangible asset of million which was being amortized over eight and a half years  the remaining term of the agreement 
we assess the potential impairment of our long lived assets  under the provisions of sfas no 
in performing such recoverability test we determined that the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows directly related to the gelclair r asset was less than the carrying value of the gelclair r asset 
as a result an impairment charge was required 
the amount of the impairment charge represents the difference between the fair value of the intangible asset and its associated carrying value 
we calculated the fair value of the intangible asset using discounted cash flows 
the discounted cash flows calculation was made utilizing various assumptions and estimates regarding future revenues and expenses  cash flow and discount rates 
based on these calculations  we determined that an impairment charge of million  which represented the full unamortized balance of the gelclair r intangible asset  was necessary as of september  the impairment charge is non cash and will not result in future cash expenditures 
the impairment charge resulted from both the recent discontinuance of discussions with a replacement dental partner  and slower than originally expected sales growth in the oncology marketplace following the re launch of the product in october amortization of intangibles the increase of million is primarily related to amortization expense related to our rights to novantrone r acquired in march and to gelclair r acquired in june as noted above  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge for the remaining carrying value of the gelclair r rights as of september  as a result of the impairment charge  amortization expense will decrease to approximately million in fiscal other income and expense year ended september  in thousands change investment income net    interest expense    other expenses net total other income expenses   the decrease in investment income in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the funds available for investment and a decrease in the average rate of return on our investments during the respective years 
the increase in interest expense resulted from interest on the million of convertible senior subordinated notes that we issued in september  as well as the guaranteed interest on the convertible senior subordinated notes that were converted into common stock in july under the terms of the convertible senior subordinated notes  the note holders were guaranteed the payment of interest for the first three years through february  the note holders became fully entitled to the remainder of this guaranteed interest on june   the date we called the notes for redemption 
as a result of the conversions  we issued million shares of our common stock in july and paid the remaining portion of the guaranteed interest of million 
this resulted in an additional interest charge of million in fiscal representing the portion of the guaranteed interest from october  to february  we expect interest expense to decrease to approximately million in fiscal  as a result of the conversion of the convertible senior subordinated notes 
included in other expenses net for fiscal and  were amortization of debt issuance costs of million and  respectively  related to the convertible senior subordinated notes 
the increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs related to the convertible senior subordinated notes issued in september the debt issuance costs are being amortized over a period of five years  which represents the earliest date that we may redeem the notes 
upon the conversion of the convertible senior subordinated notes  the unamortized balance of the debt issuance costs of million was reclassified to additional paid in capital 
also included in other expenses net for fiscal is minority interest in the net losses of prosidion of  as of september   the minority interests represent approximately ownership of prosidion 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal results of operations our fiscal net loss of million decreased million compared to our fiscal net loss of million 
the fiscal loss included an in process r d charge of million in connection with the acquisition of cell pathways 
the fiscal loss included an in process r d charge of million in connection with the acquisition of gilead s oncology assets 
revenues year ended september  in thousands change sales commissions and product sales   license and other revenues    collaborative revenues    total revenues    sales commissions and product sales on march   we began recording novantrone r sales commissions  upon the execution of our co promotion agreement with an affiliate of serono 
total sales commissions for fiscal were million 
we launched our sales efforts for novantrone r during the third quarter of fiscal we began recognizing gelclair r product sales on june   upon the closing of our acquisition of cell pathways 
total product sales for the period june  to september  were  we launched our sales effort for this product in october license and other revenues the decrease in license and other revenues in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in the amount of revenue recognized relating to the million upfront fees received from genentech and roche in january see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the provisions of sab no 
 we were recognizing the million received from genentech and roche evenly over the expected three year development phase of our agreement 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed the expected term of the agreement from three years to four years to reflect the revised estimated timing of our research and development commitment for tarceva tm under the alliance 
the revision was a result of the review of the current research data available  current developments in the her egfr targeted therapy market and the involved parties revised projections for the clinical development plan 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  the remaining unearned revenue is being recognized prospectively over the revised term 
as a result  we recorded revenues of million during fiscal compared to revenues of million during fiscal the decrease in fiscal was also due to a decrease in revenues of  related to certain administrative services provided to british biotech plc and gilead during the transition periods following the acquisitions of certain assets of each company in fiscal collaborative revenues the decrease in collaborative program revenues in fiscal was primarily due to the phase down of our collaboration in cosmeceuticals with anaderm 
in july  we entered into an agreement with pfizer to accelerate the phase down period of the collaboration with anaderm so that it would terminate no later than april  in consideration for the work performed by us during the accelerated phase down period  we received million in september and million in march upon the successful completion of the transition period 
the million was recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the transition period and the million was recognized during the second quarter of fiscal upon the successful completion of the transition 
the decrease for the year was also due to a decrease in activity related to our collaboration in diabetes with tanabe  which expired in october and was not renewed 
as a result of our strategic decision to divest all non oncology research programs  as well as the completion of the anaderm and tanabe collaborations in fiscal  we no longer expect collaborative revenue from research alliances going forward 
expenses year ended september  in thousands change cost of product sales research and development   acquired in process r d    selling  general and administrative    amortization of intangibles    cost of product sales cost of product sales related to sales of gelclair r for the period june  to september   were  or of product sales 
there were no costs of products sold prior to june  since we acquired the rights to gelclair r on june  in connection with the cell pathways acquisition 
research and development research and development expenses marginally increased during fiscal due to costs associated with the clinical development of tarceva tm and transition costs associated with the assimilation of cell pathways which were offset by a shift from non oncology and collaborative programs to oncology programs 
as of september   we invested in excess of million  representing our share of the costs incurred to date in the tripartite global development plan and additional investments outside the plan 
our research and development expenses for tarceva tm incurred for fiscal were million as compared to million for fiscal also included in research and development expenses for fiscal was a severance charge of  this charge related to a reduction in our headcount in october as we refocused our business on oncology and away from services that we had historically provided to our former collaborative partners 
acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of cell pathways  we recorded an in process r d charge of million  representing the estimated fair value of the acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the in process r d charge was assigned to the two development projects and their related technology platform and patent estates for aptosyn r million and osi million  based on their value on the date of the acquisition 
in determining the value of the in process r d  the assumed commercialization dates for these products ranged from to significant assumptions and estimates used in the valuation of in process r d included the stage of development for each of the two projects  future revenues  growth rates for each product  product sales cycles  the estimated life of a product s underlying technology  future operating expenses  probability adjustments to reflect the risk of developing the acquired technology into commercially viable products  and a discount rate of to reflect present value 
in connection with the acquisition of certain assets from gilead in december  we recorded an in process r d charge of million during fiscal  representing the estimated fair value of the acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note c to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the in process r d was allocated to three oncology candidates acquired osi l  osi and osi the value of the acquired in process r d charges were determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to products under development based upon the future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of such products 
given the risks associated with the development of new drugs  the revenue and expense forecasts were probability adjusted to reflect the risk of advancement through the approval process 
the applied risk adjustments were based on each compound s stage of development at the time of assessment and the historical probability of successful advancement for compounds at that stage 
these modeled cash flows were discounted back to their net present value 
the projected net cash flows from such projects were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to such projects 
the in process r d was valued based on the income approach that focuses on the income producing capability of the assets 
the underlying premise of this approach is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present worth of the net economic benefit cash receipts less cash outlays to be received over the life of the asset 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal due to our significant investment in commercial operations during fiscal as a result of our acquisition of the novantrone r and gelclair r rights in fiscal  as well as our preparation for the launch of tarceva tm  expenses related to commercial operations increased approximately million 
this was due to i additional management and personnel relating to the establishment of commercial operations to support gelclair r and novantrone r  ii subcontracting expenses relating to our short term transitional arrangement with a contract sales organization comprising a core of sales representatives as we built our commercial operations  iii increased commercialization and marketing costs relating to tarceva tm which were shared with genentech in accordance with the terms of our collaboration with genentech  iv expenses for maintenance fees and transition support services provided by serono relating to novantrone r sales in oncology indications  and v expenses associated with the full recovery of rights to market and distribute gelclair r from celgene  as well as transition support services provided by celgene 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal was a severance charge of  relating to a reduction in our headcount in october amortization of intangibles the increase in amortization in fiscal was primarily due to million in amortization expense related to the exclusive rights to market and promote the drug novantrone r for approved oncology indications in the united states 
also included in amortization for fiscal was  in amortization expense related to the exclusive rights to market and distribute gelclair r in north america 
offsetting these increases was a million decrease in amortization expense from fiscal attributable to the full adoption of sfas no 
on october   whereby we ceased amortizing the assembled workforce acquired from british biotech and reclassified the balance of million to goodwill 
other income and expense year ended september  in thousands change investment income net    interest expense    other expenses net  gain on early retirement of notes   gain on sale of diagnostics business   total other income expenses   the decrease to investment income net in fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average rate of return on our investments and to less funds available for investment during the period 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the interest expense incurred on the convertible senior subordinated notes 
in february  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes  which bore interest at per annum  payable semi annually  and were to mature in february in august and september  we retired a total of million in principal amount of these notes 
in july  all of the outstanding notes were converted into common stock 
in september  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes  which bear interest at per annum  are payable semi annually  and mature in september the decrease in other expense net was primarily due to the amortization of debt issuance costs of  offset by realized gains from the sale of investments of  in fiscal compared to amortization of debt issuance costs of  and a charge of  related to the writedown of our investment in a privately held healthcare information company see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in fiscal with respect to the early retirement of the convertible senior subordinated notes in august and september  we recognized a net gain of million in fiscal representing the difference between the purchase price of million and the aggregate principal of million and related accrued interest less the writedown of million of related debt issuance costs see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
also in fiscal  we recognized a million contingent payment received from the bayer corporation in december  in connection with the sale of the diagnostic business in november liquidity and capital resources general at september   working capital  representing primarily cash  cash equivalents  and restricted and unrestricted short term investments  aggregated million compared to million at september  this decrease of million was primarily due to net cash used in operating activities of million and the acquisition of certain assets from probiodrug of million  offset by proceeds from the exercise of options of million 
we expect to incur continued losses over the three years following the launch of tarceva tm as we continue our investment in the commercialization and development of tarceva tm and other product candidates in our pipeline as well as our research programs and our commercial operations 
while we have established a goal of achieving profitability and positive cash flow within years of our launch of tarceva tm  the time required to reach profitability is uncertain 
as we continue to pursue strategic in licensing and acquisition opportunities that would bring additional products and clinical development candidates to our cancer pipeline  we will be required to use our available cash and or equity securities 
to achieve profitability  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop and commercialize our technologies and products  conduct pre clinical studies and clinical trials  secure required regulatory approvals and obtain adequate assistance to successfully manufacture  introduce and market such technologies and products 
in the past  we have funded our research  development  commercial and administrative support efforts through public and private sales of our securities  including debt and equity securities 
on november   subsequent to the end of fiscal  we concluded a public offering of million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
gross proceeds totaled million with net proceeds of approximately million after all related fees 
in addition  on november   underwriters associated with this offering exercised their over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
gross proceeds from the exercise of the over allotment option totaled million with net proceeds of approximately million 
we believe that the proceeds from this offering together with existing cash resources and projected cash flows from tarceva tm will be sufficient to execute our strategy going forward as well as providing a solid financial base from which to fund our existing operations 
in september  we issued a total of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due september   or the notes  in a private placement for net proceeds of million 
the notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually  and mature on september  the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to normal and customary adjustments such as stock dividends or other dilutive transactions 
the related debt issuance costs of million were deferred and are being amortized on a straight line basis over a five year term  which represents the earliest date that we may redeem the notes 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we used million of the net proceeds for the purchase of  shares of our common stock 
with respect to the notes  we pledged million of us government securities with maturities at various dates through august upon maturity  the proceeds of these restricted investment securities will be sufficient to pay the first six scheduled interest payments on the notes when due 
the aggregate fair value and amortized cost of the restricted investment securities at september  was million 
if all or any portion of the notes have not been converted into common stock prior to their maturity date  we will be required to pay  in cash  the outstanding principal amounts of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
this could have a significant impact on our liquidity depending on our cash position at time of maturity 
if we do not have sufficient cash to repay the debt  we may need to borrow additional funds or sell additional equity in order to meet out debt obligations 
on february   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due february   or the notes  in a private placement for net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the notes were convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to normal and customary adjustments such as stock dividends 
the notes were redeemable  in whole or in part  at any time before february  if the closing price of our common stock exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time  or the provisional redemption 
the related debt issuance costs of million were deferred and were being amortized on a straight line basis over the seven year term of the notes 
in august and september  we retired a total of million in principal amount of the notes for an aggregate purchase price of million  including accrued interest of  in june  we exercised our provisional redemption option and called for the full redemption of the outstanding million of the notes 
all of the holders of the notes converted their notes into shares of our common stock prior to the redemption date of july  as a result of these conversions  we issued million shares of our common stock and paid the remaining portion of the guaranteed interest of million 
upon conversion  the million unamortized balance of the debt issuance costs was reclassified to additional paid in capital 
summary of cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for fiscal years  and in thousands cash used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    net decrease increase in cash cash equivalents    the fluctuations in cash used in operating activities are due to our increased investments in our commercial operations and research and development activities  as well as the timing of cash disbursements and receipts 
included in cash provided by used in investing activities are net payments for acquisitions in fiscal  and of million probiodrug  million novantrone r rights and million gilead oncology assets  respectively 
included in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal is million relating primarily to the exercise of stock options 
included in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and are million net of purchase of treasury stock and million net of retirements  relating to the issuance convertible senior subordinated notes  respectively 
commitments and contingencies our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our senior subordinated convertible notes and our facility leases 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands thereafter total contractual obligations senior convertible debt a        operating leases        purchase obligations b     obligations related to exit activities c   total contractual obligations        a includes interest payments at a rate of per annum relating to our notes 
b purchase obligations include inventory commitments  commercial and research commitments and other significant purchase commitments 
c includes payments for termination benefits and facility refurbishments 
other significant commitments and contingencies include the following we are committed to share equally with genentech and roche a combined million in certain global development costs for tarceva tm 
as of september   we have spent approximately of our commitment under the agreement 
we  along with our partners  expect to continue our investment in the further development of tarceva tm  beyond the originally committed million 
we are also committed to share certain commercialization costs relating to tarceva tm with genentech 
under the terms of our agreement  there are no contractually determined amounts for future commercial and development costs 
however  we are in the process of determining  together with genentech and roche  a development plan for and  together with genentech  a commercial plan for the united states for these costs will be shared by the parties pursuant to the terms of our agreement with our partners 
under agreements with external cros we will continue to incur expenses relating to clinical trials of tarceva tm and other clinical candidates 
the timing and amount of these disbursements can be based upon the achievement of certain milestones  patient enrollment  services rendered or as expenses are incurred by the cros and therefore we cannot reasonably estimate the potential timing of these payments 
we have outstanding letters of credit issued by a commercial bank totaling million of which the full amounts were available on june  one is an irrevocable letter of credit related to our oxford  england facility which expires and is renewed annually with a final expiration date of september  another is an irrevocable letter of credit related to our horsham  pennsylvania facility  whose lease we assumed through the acquisition of cell pathways 
the letter expires and is renewed annually with a final expiration date of september  we have a retirement plan which provides post retirement medical and life insurance benefits to eligible employees  board members and qualified dependents 
eligibility is determined based on age and years of service 
we have accrued postretirement benefit costs of million at september in connection with the acquisition of cell pathways  we provided additional consideration in the form of five year contingent value rights through which each share of cell pathways common stock will be eligible for an additional share of osi common stock in the event of a filing of a new drug application by june  for either of the two clinical candidates acquired from cell pathways  osi or aptosyn r 
under certain license and collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical companies and educational institutions  we are required to pay royalties and or milestone payments upon the successful development and commercialization of products 
however  successful research and development of pharmaceutical products is high risk  and most products fail to reach the market 
therefore  at this time the amount and timing of the payments  if any  are not known 
under certain license and other agreements  we are required to pay license fees for the use of technologies and products in our research and development activities or milestone payments upon the achievement of certain predetermined conditions 
these license fees are not deemed material to our consolidated financial statements and the amount and timing of the milestone payments  if any  are not known due to the uncertainty surrounding the successful research  development and commercialization of the products 
we are negotiating the potential purchase of a  square foot building  for our corporate headquarters 
we estimate the total cost of the building and required renovations  if acquired  to be approximately million  which we would finance from our existing cash 
accounting pronouncements in december  president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act introduced both a medicare prescription drug benefit and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care plans that provide a benefit at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare benefit 
these provisions of the new law will affect accounting measurements 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position  or fsp  no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the improvement and modernization act of fsp no 
fas provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  or the act  for employers that sponsor post retirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits 
it requires those employers to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the act 
the accumulated post retirement benefits obligation or net post retirement benefits cost in the consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the act on our post retirement benefit plan 
we are in the process of determining the impact of the act on the accumulated post retirement benefits obligation and net post retirement benefits cost 
issued exposure draft on march   the fasb issued a proposed statement  share based payment  that addresses the accounting for share based awards to employees  including employee stock purchase plans  or espps 
the fasb formally proposed to require companies to recognize the fair value of stock options and other stock based compensation to employees 
the proposed statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally would require instead  that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
the statement is expected to become effective for public companies during the second half of we currently account for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with apb opinion no 
therefore  the eventual adoption of this proposed statement  if issued in final form by the fasb  will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements a number of the matters and subject areas discussed in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in item business and elsewhere in this report  that are not historical or current facts  deal with potential future circumstances and developments 
the discussion of these matters and subject areas  is qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally  and these discussions may materially differ from our actual future experience involving any one or more of these matters and subject areas 
these forward looking statements are also subject generally to the other risks and uncertainties that are described in this report in item business cautionary factors that may affect future results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio of debt securities  to the fair value of equity instruments held and to foreign currency exchange rates 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss included in stockholders equity 
with respect to the convertible senior subordinated notes issued in september and february  we pledged us government securities  or restricted investment securities  with maturities at various dates through august and november  respectively 
upon conversion of the notes into our common stock in july  we were required to pay the remaining part of the guaranteed interest 
therefore  the restricted investment securities pledged in relation to these notes were liquidated 
upon maturity  the proceeds of the restricted investment securities will be sufficient to pay the first six scheduled interest payments of the notes when due 
we consider our restricted investment securities to be held to maturity as defined by sfas no 
these securities are reported at their amortized cost  which includes the direct costs to acquire the securities  plus the amortization of any discount or premium  and accrued interest earned on the securities 
we have not used or held derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at september   we maintained a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
we also maintained an investment portfolio principally comprised of government and government agency obligations and corporate obligations that are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
a hypothetical change in interest rates during the periods would have resulted in a  change in our net loss for fiscal in march  we began to enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce foreign currency fluctuation risks relating to intercompany transactions for the funding of our research activities in the united kingdom 
we account for these derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which was amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and documented as a cash flow hedge and is highly effective  are recorded in other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings  and then are later reclassified to earnings 
we formally assess  both at the inception and at each financial quarter thereafter  the effectiveness of the derivative instrument hedging the underlying forecasted cash flow transaction 
any ineffectiveness related to the derivative financial instruments change in fair value will be recognized in the period in which the ineffectiveness was calculated 
as of september   the notional and fair value of the foreign exchange contracts for british pounds was million 
the contracts will mature over the next two months 
our limited investments in certain biotechnology companies are carried on the equity method or cost method of accounting using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
other than temporary losses are recorded against earnings in the same period the loss was deemed to have occurred 
our long term debt totaled million at september  and was comprised of our notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of 
in june  we exercised our provisional redemption right and called for the full redemption of the outstanding million of the notes which we issued in february all of the holders of these notes converted their notes into shares of our common stock prior to the redemption date of july  as a result of these conversions  in july  we issued million shares of our common stock and paid the remaining portion of the guaranteed interest of million 
underlying market risk exists related to an increase in our stock price or an increase in interest rates which may make the conversion of the convertible senior subordinated notes to common stock beneficial to the convertible senior subordinated notes holders 
conversion of the convertible senior subordinated notes would have a dilutive effect on any future earnings and book value per common share
