item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
see risk factors under item  of part i of this annual report regarding certain factors known to us that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results 
overview we opened our first restaurant under the name rubio s  home of the fish taco in  and have grown to restaurants 
we position our restaurants in the high quality  quick casual mexican food segment of the restaurant industry 
our business strategy is to become the leading brand in this industry segment 
we had a loss for fiscal year  but were profitable in the second half of the year 
this profitable second half was due to our success in improving the performance of our existing restaurants 
we accomplished this improvement through a variety of initiatives 
we worked diligently to control labor and food costs  instituting safety programs to reduce workers compensation costs  which was the primary reason for our increase in labor costs in the first half of we have focused on reducing our food and paper costs by working with our suppliers to get the best prices available in the market 
additionally  our focus has been on continuous improvement in our existing stores economic model 
this includes driving top line sales to increase our average unit values  and driving cost management to improve margins overall 
the goal of our evolving menu is to maintain our heritage of offering inexpensive  distinctive fish and seafood items while expanding our offerings of more expensive chicken  pork  and beef items 
we believe this new mix of items will increase our unit profitability 
we also believe that the greater emphasis on chicken  beef and pork items will be better received in new geographic markets outside of southern california  once we renew our expansion efforts outside of california in we continue to position our company to expand into new markets 
currently  we are working to improve our unit performance so that we may begin expansion into new markets in we have two signed franchise agreements as of march   representing commitments to open units  one of which was open as of march  during  we opened seven restaurants  converted two existing franchise locations to company operated restaurants  and executed a planned closure of one underperforming location 
our current expansion plan calls for us to open five to eight company owned restaurants in fiscal as a result of our historical expansion  period to period comparisons of our financial results may not be meaningful 
when a new unit opens  it will typically incur higher than normal levels of food and labor costs until new personnel gain experience 
hourly labor schedules are gradually adjusted downward during the first three months of a restaurant opening  in order to reach operating efficiencies similar to those at established units 
in calculating our comparable restaurant base  we introduce a restaurant into our comparable restaurant base once it has been in operation for fifteen calendar months 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis including those relating to impairment of assets  restructuring charges  contingencies and litigation 
our estimates and assumptions have been prepared on the basis of the most current available information  and actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a review of the more critical accounting policies and methods used by us asset impairment and store closure expense reversal we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment when a restaurant experiences a negative event  including  but not limited to  a significant downturn in sales  a 
table of contents substantial loss of customers  an unfavorable change in demographics or a store closure 
upon the occurrence of a negative event  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows for the individual restaurants that are affected by the negative event 
if the projected undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the assets at each restaurant  we recognize an impairment loss to reduce the assets carrying amounts to their estimated fair value for assets to be held and used and fair value less cost to sell for assets to be disposed of based on the discounted projected cash flows derived from the restaurant 
the most significant assumptions in the analysis are those used to estimate a restaurant s future cash flows 
we use the assumptions in our strategic plan and modify them as necessary based on restaurant specific information 
if the significant assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our operating restaurant assets may be overstated or understated  as well as the related impairment charge 
we estimate that it takes a new restaurant approximately months to run at its full capacity 
any restaurant open months or less  therefore  is not included in the analysis of long lived asset impairment  unless other events or circumstances arise 
we make decisions to close stores based on their cash flows and anticipated future profitability 
we record losses associated with the closure of restaurants at the time the unit is closed 
these store closure charges primarily represent a liability for the future lease obligations after the expected closure dates  net of estimated sublease income  if any 
the amount of our store closure liability  and related store closure charge  may change if we are successful in either terminating a lease early or obtaining a more favorable sublease  or if any of our sublesees default on their leases 
asset impairment and store closure expense are estimates that we have recorded based on reasonable assumptions related to these restaurant locations at this point in time 
the conditions regarding these locations may change in the future and could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to maintain or improve sales levels  our ability to secure subleases  our success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors  the general health of the economy and resultant demand for commercial property 
because of the factors used to estimate impairment and store closure expense  amounts recorded may not be sufficient  and adjustments may be necessary 
self insurance liabilities we are self insured for a portion of our workers compensation insurance program 
maximum self insured retention  including defense costs per occurrence  ranges from  during our claim year ended october  to  during our claim year ending october  insurance liabilities are accounted for based on the value of independent actuarial estimates of the amount of loss incurred 
these estimates rely on actuarial observations of industry wide historical claim loss development 
the actual loss development may be better or worse than the development estimated by the actuary 
in that event  we will modify the reserve  and our operating expenses will increase or decrease accordingly 
consistent with trends the restaurant industry has experienced in recent years  particularly in california where claim loss trends are among the highest in the country  workers compensation liability premiums continue to increase 
revenue recognition revenues from the operation of company owned restaurants are recognized when sales occur 
franchise revenue is comprised of area development fees  new store opening fees  royalties and information technology help desk fees 
fees received pursuant to area development agreements under individual franchise agreements  which grant the right to develop franchised restaurants in future periods in specific geographic areas  are deferred and recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis as the individual franchised restaurants subject to the development agreements are opened 
new store opening fees are recognized as revenue in the month a franchised location opens 
royalties from franchised restaurants are recorded in revenue as earned 
information technology help desk fees are collected annually and are recorded ratably into revenue 
these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented 
results of operations all comparisons under this heading between  and refer to the week periods ended december   december   and december   unless otherwise indicated 
our operating results  expressed as a percentage of total revenue  were as follows fiscal years total revenue costs and expenses cost of sales restaurant labor  occupancy and other general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization 
table of contents fiscal years pre opening expenses asset impairment and store closure expense reversal loss on disposal sale of property operating income loss other expense income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss weeks ended december  compared to the weeks ended december  results of operations reflect weeks of operations for restaurants  and partial period operations for restaurants for the weeks ended december  results of operations reflect weeks of operations for restaurants and a partial period of operations for restaurants for the weeks ended december  revenue 
revenue increased million or  to million for the weeks ended december  from million for the weeks ended december  the increase in was primarily due to sales of million from our seven store openings and two converted franchise stores  million in sales generated by a full twelve months of operations from units opened in that were not yet in our comparable unit base  and an increase in comparable store sales of million  or  offset by a decrease of million in sales from the four stores that closed in and million for the four stores sold to a franchisee in units enter the comparable store base after full months of operation 
the increase in comparable store sales was primarily due to a increase in the average check amount  offset by a decrease in transactions 
sales were softer than expected  reflecting  in part  the poor southern california weather in the first and second quarters  weak retail activity because of the war in iraq  and overall economic conditions  offset by two strong summer seafood taco promotions and the introduction of new products 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to in the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher food costs associated with our larger portions  expanded salsa bar  and upgraded packaging for our brand repositioning conversion 
the increase was also due to the shift in our product mix  as anticipated  from lower priced fish menu items to higher priced chicken and steak menu items as a result of our new menu  and to a high cost promotion in the second quarter 
in order to lower these costs on a go forward basis  we have sourced new vendors and switched to less expensive packaging  as well as implemented a small price increase to help offset our higher food costs 
we do  however  anticipate that our chicken and steak costs will continue to be higher than in the past due to recent price increases in both the poultry and cattle markets 
restaurant labor  occupancy and other 
restaurant labor  occupancy  and other increased as a percentage of revenues to for the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenue was due to a increase related to workers compensation expenses caused by unusually costly claims that required the company to increase its workers compensation accrual  a increase related to labor  advertising  and unit operating expenses associated with training  promotion  supplies  upgrades and uniforms for the brand repositioning conversion mentioned in the discussion of cost of sales above  a increase in occupancy costs related to annual rent increases per our lease agreements  as well as a increase in utilities due to a general increase in the cost of utilities 
we do not anticipate the need to significantly adjust our workers compensation accrual in actual loss development  however  may be better or worse than the development estimated by the actuary  which could positively or negatively impact our results of operations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million or of revenue  in the weeks ending december  from million  or of revenue  in the weeks ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a increase in professional service fees and a increase related to workers compensation costs  partially offset by a decrease in corporate labor and labor related costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in the weeks ended december  from million in the weeks ended december  the million increase was primarily due to the additional depreciation on the three new units opened during the last six months of  the seven new units opened during  and the two franchise stores converted to company owned restaurants in  partially offset by reductions in depreciation expense due to the closure of one store in and to the impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 
table of contents pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses increased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  primarily due to the increase in unit openings to nine in seven new locations  plus two previously franchised locations  plus costs incurred during for two units that opened in the first part of  compared to eight unit openings in the average pre opening cost per new unit opening was  per unit  a  increase per unit from this increase was the combined effect of a focused effort to increase training before locations open so that our operations will run more smoothly and achieve profitability more quickly  and the fact that we opened several locations during further away from our home base  causing our training team to incur higher travel costs 
asset impairment and store closure expense reversal 
asset impairment and store closure expense increased to million in the weeks ended december  from a reversal of  in the weeks ended december  during fiscal  we recorded a charge of million  representing the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the estimated fair value of under performing restaurants as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
of the locations  five were located outside of southern california and four had been partially impaired in we currently plan to operate these restaurant locations through the end of their remaining lease terms  generally from through the assets impaired at these under performing locations consisted of leasehold improvements and fixtures and equipment 
fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flows approach for the leasehold improvements and fixtures and equipment 
the primary factors that lead to the impairment charge were the lower than anticipated increases in comparative store sales  higher than anticipated operating costs associated with our system wide brand repositioning program  and escalating workers compensation costs 
in addition  during fiscal  we recorded a charge of  to increase our store closure reserve to reflect the difficulty in identifying suitable sublessees and our revised estimate that we will need to continue full lease payments longer than originally estimated  and a reversal of million to decrease our store closure reserve based on lease terminations and subleases that were more favorable than the original estimates 
during fiscal  we recorded a store closure reversal of million based primarily on lease terminations and subleases that were more favorable than the original estimates and lower severance charges 
this reversal was offset by of a charge of  to reflect additional costs we expected to incur on our remaining lease obligations 
loss on disposal sale of property 
loss on asset disposals was  in compared to  in the higher loss in primarily relates to the write off of exterior signs and additional properties related to the concept repositioning 
other expense income net 
other expense income net decreased to  expense for the weeks ended december  from  expense for the weeks ended december  interest income decreased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  the decrease is primarily due to declining interest rates paid on both our investments and our cash balances 
interest expense decreased to  for from  in due to the fact that we repaid our million line of credit during income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the weeks ended december  and weeks ended december  is based on the approximate annual effective tax rate applied to the respective period s pretax book income 
the tax benefit applied to comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate on pre tax loss of million for the tax provision applied to comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate on a pre tax income of million for weeks ended december  compared to the weeks ended december  results of operations reflect weeks of operations for restaurants  and partial period operations for restaurants for the weeks ended december  results of operations reflect weeks of operations for restaurants and a partial period of operations for restaurants for the weeks ended december  revenue 
revenue increased million or  to million for the weeks ended december  from million for the weeks ended december  the increase in was due in part to million in sales generated by a full year of operations from units opened in and that were not in our comparable unit base previously  combined with the million from the eight units opened in revenues were reduced million by the closure of three and eleven under performing restaurants in and  respectively  and the franchising of four restaurants on april  in  same store sales increased million  or 
units enter the comparable store base after full months of operation 
the increase in comparable store sales was primarily due to a decrease in transactions  offset by a increase in the average check amount 
the decrease in transactions was caused primarily from adverse weather conditions  the sluggish economy and a reduction in price promotions in connection with our concept repositioning 

table of contents cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased to in the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the elimination of certain retail discount programs  lower commodity prices  partially offset by cost increases associated with our concept repositioning 
restaurant labor  occupancy and other 
restaurant labor  occupancy  and other decreased as a percentage of revenues to for the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  the decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales is due in part to a decrease in labor and related costs of  due to higher occupancy charges  due to higher advertising costs and from the expenses relating to our concept repositioning 
the decrease in labor and related costs was partially due to the closure of several underperforming stores in and  and the implementation of labor saving programs in early general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in the weeks ending december  from million in the weeks ended december  decreased corporate wages and training wages were offset by an increase in stock compensation and a decrease in capitalized wages in the decrease in wages was primarily related to open positions through the year and organization changes 
the decrease in training wages was primarily due to lower management turnover 
the increase in stock compensation was due to a consulting agreement with a non employee board member for various marketing and strategic corporate initiatives 
the decrease in capitalized wages was due to fewer new restaurant openings in as compared with general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in  primarily due to our expanding revenue base 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in the weeks ended december  from million in the weeks ended december  the million increase was primarily due to the additional depreciation on the eight new units opened during and the new units opened during  offset by decreased depreciation as a result of store closures and asset impairments taken in september  franchising of the four nevada restaurants in april and the closures of three restaurants in february  august and october as a percentage of sales  depreciation and amortization decreased to in from in pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses decreased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  primarily due to the decrease in unit openings to eight in compared to in the average pre opening cost per new unit opening was  per unit  a decrease of  per unit from asset impairment and store closure expense reversal 
in  we recorded a million charge related to the impairment of a select number of under performing restaurants as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
additionally  we incurred million in store closure expense related to the closure or pending closure of under performing restaurants 
these special charges  which consisted primarily of lease reserves and de identification costs  were as follows a million reserve for closed stores in  million reserve for stores to be closed and million in reserves for severance and other closed store related charges 
eleven stores were closed in october  and three additional stores were closed in february  august and october as of march   nine of the underlying leases related to the closed stores had been terminated with lease buyouts  and four other leases had been sublet 
the company was able to negotiate lease terminations that were more favorable than originally anticipated  in addition to lower severance related costs than anticipated  and in the company reversed million of the charge for store closures 
this reversal was offset by a charge of  to reflect additional costs we expected to incur on our remaining lease obligations loss on disposal sale of property 
loss on asset disposals was  in compared to  in the higher loss in primarily relates to the write off of exterior signs and additional properties related to the concept repositioning 
other expense income net 
other expense income net decreased to  expense for the weeks ended december  from  in net other income for the weeks ended december  interest income decreased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  the decrease is primarily due to declining interest rates paid on our investments 
in addition  the average interest rate earned on our cash balances decreased due to the declining interest rate environment 
interest expense remained fairly steady at  in and  in income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the weeks ended december  and weeks ended december  is based on the approximate annual effective tax rate applied to the respective period s pretax book income 
the tax provision applied to comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate on pre tax income of 
table of contents million for the tax benefit applied to comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate on a pre tax loss of million for seasonality historically  we have experienced seasonal variability in our quarterly operating results with higher sales per restaurant in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
the higher sales in the second and third quarters affect profitability by reducing the impact of our restaurants fixed and semi fixed costs  as well as through increased revenues 
this seasonal impact on our operating results is expected to continue 
inflation components of our operations subject to inflation include food  beverage  lease  utility  labor and insurance costs 
substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor  and operating expenses could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our guests 
our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation with respect to workers compensation insurance and utility expense has had a material impact on our results of operations in and additionally  accrued expenses and other liabilities associated with workers compensation insurance  as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets  increased by million to million as of december  from  as of december  liquidity and capital resources we have funded our capital requirements in recent years through public sale of equity securities  private placement of preferred stock  bank debt and cash flow from operations 
we generated million in cash flow from operating activities for the weeks ended december  and million for the weeks ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the weeks ended december  compared to million for the weeks ended december  net cash used in investing activities for the weeks ended december  included million in capital expenditures and million in purchases of investments  partially offset by million in proceeds received from the sale of property and the sale maturities of investments 
net cash used in investing activities for the weeks ended december  included million in capital expenditures and million in purchases of investments  partially offset by million in proceeds received from the sale of property and the sale maturities of investments 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the weeks ended december  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the weeks ended december  net cash used in financing activities during was comprised of million in principal payments to pay off our line of credit  partially offset by million in proceeds received from exercises of common stock options 
financing activities in primarily consisted of proceeds from exercises of common stock options  which generated million 
as of december   we had million borrowed on our million line of credit 
in june  we repaid this outstanding balance  and in august  we terminated the line of credit agreement 
on october   we obtained a letter of credit in the amount of million related to our workers compensation policy that matures in october the letter of credit is subject to automatic extension one year from the expiration date and thereafter  unless notification is made prior to the expiration date 
we were also required  per the terms of the letter of credit  to pledge collateral of million 
our funds were principally used for the development and opening of new units 
we incurred million in capital expenditures during the weeks ended december   of which  million was for newly opened units  million for future openings  million for menu board upgrades  remodels and point of sale system upgrades due to our brand repositioning conversion  million for routine capital expenditures at our existing locations and million for corporate and information technology expenditures 
we incurred million in capital expenditures during the weeks ended december   of which  million was for newly opened units  million for future openings  million for menu board upgrades  remodels and point of sale system upgrades  million for routine capital expenditures at our existing locations and million for corporate and information technology expenditures 

table of contents we currently expect total capital expenditures in to be approximately million to million for restaurant openings  remodels  maintenance  and for corporate and information technology 
we currently expect that future locations will generally cost between  and  per unit  net of landlord allowances and excluding pre opening expenses 
some units may exceed this range due to the area in which they are built and the specific requirements of the project 
pre opening expenses are expected to average between  and  per restaurant 
we believe that the anticipated cash flow from operations combined with our cash and investments balance of million as of december  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
changes in our operating plans  changes in our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses  potential acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional or alternative financing sooner than anticipated 
additional or alternative financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional or alternative financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
contractual obligations and commitments the following represents a comprehensive list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  total thereafter in thousands company operated retail locations and other operating leases franchise operated retail locations operating leases we lease restaurant and office facilities and real property under operating leases expiring through we have leased all of our facilities  except for one building  to minimize the cash investment associated with each unit 
most of our leases are for year terms and include options to extend the terms 
the majority of our leases also include fixed rate and percentage of sales rent provisions  and most require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area  and other operating costs 
in addition  we are on the master leases for franchise locations 
these locations were previously company operated before they were sold to a franchisee 
once they were sold to the franchisee  sublease documents were executed  and the franchisee began to pay rent directly to the landlords 
should this franchisee default on its subleases  we would be responsible 
our maximum theoretical future exposure at december   computed as the sum of all remaining lease payments through the expiration dates of the respective leases was million 
this amount does not take into consideration any mitigating measures that we could take to reduce this exposure in the event of default  including re leasing the locations  or terminating the master lease by negotiating a lump payment to the landlord less than the sum of all remaining future rents 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation provides guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  variable interest entities 
variable interest entities are entities that lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or lack sufficient equity to finance activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if that company is obligated to absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses or is entitled to receive the majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
fin r also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
fin r is applicable immediately to variable interest entities created after february  for all variable interest entities created prior to february   fin r is applicable to the first interim period ending after march  we are in the process of evaluating the impact this interpretation will have on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments primarily with maturities of less than one year 
the portfolio consists primarily of corporate and municipal bonds 
as of december   we had no investments with maturities in excess of one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
due to the types of investment and debt instruments the company has  a change in period end interest rates or a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates would not have a significant negative affect on our financial results 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments with terms of less than one year 
we do not believe that these purchase commitments are material to our operations as a whole 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
