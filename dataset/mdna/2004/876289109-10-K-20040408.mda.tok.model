overview tarrant apparel group is a leading provider of casual apparel  serving mass merchandisers  department stores  branded wholesalers and specialty chains located primarily in the united states by designing  merchandising  contracting for the manufacture of  manufacturing directly and selling casual apparel for women  men and children 
we generate revenues from the sale of apparel merchandise to our customers that we manufacture or have manufactured by third party contract manufacturers located outside of the united states 
revenues and net loss for the years ended december   and were as follows dollars in thousands revenues and net loss net sales    net loss before cumulative effect of accounting change    net loss after cumulative effect of accounting change    cash flows for the years ended december   and were as follows dollars in thousands cash flows net cash provided by operating activities 
   net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in financing activities    significant developments in restructuring of mexican operations in august  we determined to abandon our strategy of being both a trading and vertically integrated manufacturing company  and commencing september   we ceased directly operating nearly all of our equipment and fixed assets in mexico by leasing and outsourcing the management of a substantial majority of our mexican operations to affiliates of mr 
kamel nacif  one of our shareholders 
we made our determination based on many factors  including the following o our vertical integration strategy in mexico required significant working capital  which required us to significantly increase debt to finance our mexico operations 
such financing was not available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
o we faced the challenges of rising overhead costs and the need to take low and sometimes negative margin orders in slow seasons to fill capacity at our facilities  which reduced our overall average gross margin 
o the elimination of quotas on wto member countries by  and the other effects of trade agreements among wto countries  would soon result in increased competition from developing countries  which historically have lower labor costs  including china and taiwan  both of which recently became members of the wto 
our withdrawal from our owned and operated facilities in mexico on september   has reduced our working capital requirements  eliminated the need to accept low or negative margin orders to fill production capacity  and permitted us to source production in the best locations world wide 
we believe that our strong design  merchandising and sourcing capabilities are competitive advantages that will enable us to overcome the desire by some retailers to purchase merchandise directly from the manufacturer 
due to our change of strategy in mexico  at june  we wrote off approximately million in goodwill associated with certain assets we acquired in mexico  and wrote down million of inventory in mexico in anticipation of its liquidation at reduced prices 
we will receive million per annum from the lessor of our equipment and facilities in mexico over the year term of the leases 
we have agreed to purchase annually  six million yards of fabric manufactured at the facilities leased and or operated by mr 
nacif s affiliates at market prices to be negotiated 
see note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
equity financings in october  we sold an aggregate of  shares of the series a convertible preferred stock  at per share  to a group of institutional investors and high net worth individuals and raised an aggregate of approximately million  after payment of commissions and expenses 
we used the proceeds of this offering to pay accounts payable and reduce debts 
the preferred stock was converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock following a special meeting of shareholders held on december  we have registered the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the series a preferred stock with the securities and exchange commission for resale by the investors 
in conjunction with the private placement transaction  we issued a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock to the placement agent 
the warrant is exercisable beginning april  through october  and has a per share exercise price of 
in january  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  for aggregate proceeds to us of approximately million after payment of placement agent fees and other offering expenses 
we used the proceeds of this offering for working capital purposes 
the securities sold in the offering were registered under the securities act of  as amended  pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement 
in conjunction with this public offering  we issued a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock to the placement agent  the warrant has an exercise price of per share  is fully vested and exercisable and has a term of five years 
private brands initiative during  we launched our private brands initiative  where we acquire ownership of or exclusively license rights to a brand name and sell apparel products under this brand to a single retail company within a geographic region 
in the second quarter of  we acquired an equity interest in the owner of the trademark american rag cie  and the operator of american rag retail stores  and our subsidiary  private brands  inc  acquired a license to certain exclusive rights to this trademark 
private brands then entered into a multi year exclusive distribution agreement with federated merchandising group fmg  the sourcing arm of federated department stores  to supply fmg with american rag cie  a new casual sportswear collection for juniors and young men 
beginning in august  the american rag collection is available in approximately select macy s  the bon marche  burdines  goldsmith s  lazarus and rich s macy s locations 
during  we also began selling products under our owned brand no jeans exclusively to wet seal 
with a private brand relationship  we own and control the brand and thus build equity in the brand as the product gains acceptance by consumers 
in a private label relationship  we source products for our customers who own and control the brand and thus benefit from any increase in value of the brand 
we also control the production of private brand merchandise  unlike private label merchandise where the brand owner controls sourcing 
for instance  we experienced a significant loss of business from lane bryant due to a change in their management and the subsequent shift in their sourcing strategy 
we believe that forming private brand alliances with premier retailers allows us greater penetration of apparel categories in addition to our core casual bottoms business 
in addition to the increased breadth of classifications  we have improved our ability to compete for private label from our private brand 
we also receive higher margins for private branded merchandise  which allows us to be more profitable on the same level of unit sales 
internal revenue service audit in january  the internal revenue service completed its examination of our federal income tax returns for the years ended december  through the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our income tax payable for the six years under examination by an aggregate of approximately million 
this adjustment would also result in additional state taxes and interest of approximately million 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to and intend to vigorously contest the proposed adjustments 
if the proposed adjustments are upheld through the administrative and legal process  they could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flow 
we believe we have provided adequate reserves for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters on the balance sheet included in the consolidated financial statements under the caption income taxes 
we do not believe that the adjustments  if any  arising from the irs examination  will result in an additional income tax liability beyond what is recorded in the accompanying balance sheet 
while we do not anticipate any requirement to make significant cash payments in the coming to months to the taxing authorities  we intend to accumulate a contingency cash reserve from operations to meet a potential cash outflow upon the ultimate resolution of these matters 
building this cash reserve will require us to set aside on a periodic basis a significant portion of our cash from operations  which we do not intend on using for other purposes 
labor difficulties in mexico in connection with the restructuring of our mexican operations  and the resulting reduction in our mexican work force  a group of laid off workers attempted to form a new labor union and organized walkouts and demonstrations at one of our sewing plants in ajalpan  mexico 
these demonstrations took place in august and were short lived  but very well publicized 
workers rights groups picked up the story and began an internet campaign to publicize the workers grievances 
in october  a local labor board denied the group s application to organize a new union 
nevertheless  we have remained the target of workers rights activists who have picketed our customers  stuffed electronic mailboxes with inaccurate  protest e mails  and threatened customers with retaliation for continuing business with us 
while we have defended our position to our customers  some of our larger customers for mexico produced jeans wear have been reluctant to place orders with us in response to actions taken and contemplated by these activist groups 
as a consequence  we project a loss of approximately million in revenue from sales of mexico produced merchandise in critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to returns  discounts  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable allowance for returns  discounts and bad debts we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable and chargebacks disputes from the customer based upon a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit sources  a specific reserve for bad debts is taken against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts and chargebacks based on our historical collection experience 
if collection experience deteriorates for example  due to an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
as of december   the balance in the allowance for returns  discounts and bad debts reserves was million  compared to million at december  inventory our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
under certain market conditions  we use estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory to properly value inventory 
investory adjustments are made for the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value and charged to operations in the period in which the facts that give rise to the adjustments become known 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following o a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o a significant change in the manner of the use of the acquired asset or the strategy for the overall business  or o a significant negative industry or economic trend 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
according to this statement  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization  but rather an annual assessment of impairment applied on a fair value based test 
we adopted sfas no 
in fiscal and performed our first annual assessment of impairment  which resulted in an impairment loss of million 
we utilized the discounted cash flow methodology to estimate fair value 
at december   we have a goodwill balance of million  and a net property and equipment balance of million  as compared to a goodwill balance of million and a net property and equipment balance of million at december  our goodwill balance reflects the write off of million of goodwill as discussed in significant developments in restructuring of mexican operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding us federal tax issues that are currently unresolved  based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that amounts are properly accrued for 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we will record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in any period we determine that the original estimate of a tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current tax matters 
debt covenants our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and a minimum level of net worth as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if our results of operations erode and we are not able to obtain waivers from the lenders  the debt would be in default and callable by our lenders 
in addition  due to cross default provisions in a majority of the debt agreements  approximately of our long term debt would become due in full if any of the debt is in default 
in anticipation of us not being able to meet the required covenants due to various reasons  we either negotiate for changes in the relative covenants or an advance waiver or reclassify the relevant debt as current 
we also believe that our lenders would provide waivers if necessary 
however  our expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with other debt covenants cannot be assured and our lenders actions are not controllable by us 
if projections of future operating results are not achieved and the debt is placed in default  we would be required to reduce our expenses  including by curtailing operations  and to raise capital through the sale of assets  issuance of equity or otherwise  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

we do not believe that the moderate levels of inflation in the united states in the last three years have had a significant effect on net sales or profitability 
related party transactions we lease our principal offices and warehouse located in los angeles  california and office space in hong kong from corporations owned by gerard guez  our chairman and chief executive officer  and todd kay  our vice chairman of the board of directors

the series a preferred stock was converted into  shares of common stock following approval of the conversion by our shareholders at the annual shareholders meeting held on may  on july   we formed an entity to jointly market  share certain risks and achieve economies of scale with azteca production international  inc azteca  called united apparel ventures  llc uav 
azteca production international  inc is owned by hubert guez  the brother of gerard guez  our chairman and chief executive officer 
this entity was created to coordinate the production of apparel for a single customer of our branded business 
uav is owned by tag mex  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  and by azteca 
results of the operation of uav have been consolidated into our results since july with the minority partner s share of all gains and loses eliminated through the minority interest line in our financial statements

tag it assumed the responsibility for managing and sourcing all trim and packaging used in connection with products manufactured by or on our behalf in mexico 
this arrangement is terminable by either tag it or us at any time 
we believe that the terms of this arrangement  which is subject to the acceptance of our customers  are no less favorable to us than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
we purchased million  million and million of trim from tag it during the years ended december   and we also sold tag it million from our trim and fabric inventory during the year ended december  from time to time we have guaranteed the indebtedness of tag it for the purchase of trim on our behalf 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have adopted a policy that any future transactions between us and any of our affiliates or related parties  including our executive officers  directors  the family members of those individuals and any of their affiliates  must i be approved by a majority of the members of the board of directors and by a majority of the disinterested members of the board of directors and ii be on terms no less favorable to us than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  which are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth below 
risks related to our business we depend on a group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales 
a significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer s financial position could harm our business and financial condition 
affiliated stores owned by the limited including limited stores and express accounted for approximately and of our net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
lane bryant accounted for and of our net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
lerner new york accounted for and of our net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
kohl s accounted for and of our net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
we believe that consolidation in the retail industry has centralized purchasing decisions and given customers greater leverage over suppliers such as tarrant  and we expect this trend to continue 
if this consolidation continues  our net sales and results of operations may be increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the financial condition of  or other adverse developments with  one or more of our customers 
while we have long standing customer relationships  we generally do not have long term contracts with any of them  including express 
purchases generally occur on an order by order basis  and relationships exist as long as there is a perceived benefit to both parties 
a decision by a major customer  whether motivated by competitive considerations  financial difficulties  and economic conditions or otherwise  to decrease its purchases from us or to change its manner of doing business with us  could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
in addition  during recent years  various retailers  including some of our customers  have experienced significant changes and difficulties  including consolidation of ownership  increased centralization of purchasing decisions  restructurings  bankruptcies and liquidations 
these and other financial problems of some of our retailers  as well as general weakness in the retail environment  increase the risk of extending credit to these retailers 
a significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer  require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer s receivables  limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous purchases by that customer  or result in required prepayment of our receivables securitization arrangements  all of which could harm our business and financial condition 
failure to manage our growth and expansion could impair our business 
since our inception  we have experienced periods of rapid growth 
no assurance can be given that we will be successful in maintaining or increasing our sales in the future 
any future growth in sales will require additional working capital and may place a significant strain on our management  management information systems  inventory management  production capability  distribution facilities and receivables management 
any disruption in our order processing  sourcing or distribution systems could cause orders to be shipped late  and under industry practices  retailers generally can cancel orders or refuse to accept goods due to late shipment 
such cancellations and returns would result in a reduction in revenue  increased administrative and shipping costs and a further burden on our distribution facilities 
failure to manage our restructuring in mexico could impair our business 
we have determined to cease directly operating a substantial majority of our equipment and fixed assets in mexico  and to lease a large portion of our facilities and operations in mexico to a related third party  which we consummated effective september  as a consequence  we have become primarily a trading company  relying on third party manufacturers to produce the merchandise we sell to our customers 
we face many challenges related to our decision to cease directly operating a substantial majority of our equipment and fixed assets in mexico 
any failure on our part to successfully manage these challenges  or other unanticipated consequences may result in loss of customers and sales  which would have an adverse impact on operations 
the challenges we face include o we may lose customers who desire to purchase merchandise directly from the manufacturer  o we may experience unanticipated expenses in winding down manufacturing operations in mexico  including labor costs and additional write down of inventory  which may adversely affect our results of operations in the short term  o the party to whom we lease our manufacturing operations in mexico may default in its obligations to us  in which case we may not be able to lease the facilities to another party  or recommence use of the facilities to manufacture goods without significant cost  and o we may not be able to transfer mexico sales to our trading model in time to replace direct to manufacturer orders we have experienced in the past due  for instance  to difficulty in finding third party manufacturers  and capital constraints 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  substantial variations in our net sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
we believe that the factors which influence this variability of quarterly results include the timing of our introduction of new product lines  the level of consumer acceptance of each new product line  general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending and retailer purchasing  the availability of manufacturing capacity  the seasonality of the markets in which we participate  the timing of trade shows  the product mix of customer orders  the timing of the placement or cancellation of customer orders  the weather  transportation delays  quotas  the occurrence of charge backs in excess of reserves and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales and actions of competitors 
due to fluctuations in our revenue and operating expenses  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters  our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that case  our stock price could fluctuate significantly or decline 
increases in the price of raw materials or their reduced availability could increase our cost of sales and decrease our profitability 
the principal raw material used in our apparel is cotton 
the price and availability of cotton may fluctuate significantly  depending on a variety of factors  including crop yields  weather  supply conditions  government regulation  economic climate and other unpredictable factors 
any raw material price increases could increase our cost of sales and decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers 
moreover  any decrease in the availability of cotton could impair our ability to meet our production requirements in a timely manner 
the success of our business depends upon our ability to offer fashion right and timely products 
the apparel industry is characterized by constant product innovation due to changing consumer preferences and by the rapid replication of new products by competitors 
as a result  our success depends in large part on our ability to continuously develop  market and deliver innovative products at a pace and intensity competitive with other manufacturers in our segments 
in addition  we must create products that appeal to multiple consumer segments at a range of price points 
any failure on our part to regularly develop innovative products and update core products could o limit our ability to differentiate  segment and price our products  o adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of our products  and o limit sales potential 
the increasing importance of product innovation in apparel requires us to strengthen our internal research and commercialization capabilities  to rely on successful commercial relationships with third parties such as fiber  fabric and finishing providers and to compete and negotiate effectively for new technologies and product components 
the financial condition of our customers could affect our results of operations 
certain retailers  including some of our customers  have experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  financial difficulties  which increase the risk of extending credit to such retailers and the risk that financial failure will eliminate a customer entirely 
these retailers have attempted to improve their own operating efficiencies by concentrating their purchasing power among a narrowing group of vendors 
there can be no assurance that we will remain a preferred vendor for our existing customers 
a decrease in business from or loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that our factor will approve the extension of credit to certain retail customers in the future 
if a customer s credit is not approved by the factor  we could assume the collection risk on sales to the customer itself  require that the customer provide a letter of credit  or choose not to make sales to the customer 
the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
we need talented and experienced personnel in a number of areas including our core business activities 
our success is dependent upon strengthening our management depth across our business at a rapid pace 
an inability to retain and attract qualified personnel or the loss of any of our current key executives could harm our business 
our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is adversely affected by the los angeles location of our corporate headquarters due to the high cost of living in the los angeles area 
we depend on our computer and communications systems 
as a multi national corporation  we rely on our computer and communication network to operate efficiently 
any interruption of this service from power loss  telecommunications failure  weather  natural disasters or any similar event could have a material adverse affect on our business and operations 
additionally  hackers and computer viruses have disrupted operations at many major companies 
we may be vulnerable to similar acts of sabotage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
we may require additional capital in the future 
we may not be able to fund our future growth or react to competitive pressures if we lack sufficient funds 
currently  we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and cash available through our bank credit facilities  issuance of long term debt  proceeds from loans from affiliates  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options to fund existing operations for the foreseeable future 
however  in the future we may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or collaborative relationships 
this additional funding may not be available or  if available  it may not be available on economically reasonable terms 
in addition  any additional funding may result in significant dilution to existing shareholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations or obtain funds through collaborative partners that may require us to release material rights to our products 
our business is subject to risks associated with importing products 
substantially all of our import operations are subject to tariffs imposed on imported products and quotas imposed by trade agreements 
in addition  the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions 
adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions  or our suppliers failure to comply with customs or similar laws  could harm our business 
we cannot assure that future trade agreements will not provide our competitors with an advantage over us  or increase our costs  either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement  and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization 
generally  these trade agreements benefit our business by reducing or eliminating the duties and or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country 
however  trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect our business  such as limiting the countries from which we can purchase raw materials and setting quotas on products that may be imported into the united states from a particular country 
in addition  the world trade organization may commence a new round of trade negotiations that liberalize textile trade by further eliminating quotas or reducing tariffs 
the elimination of quotas on world trade organization member countries by and other effects of these trade agreements could result in increased competition from developing countries  which historically have lower labor costs  including china and taiwan  both of which recently became members of the world trade organization 
this potential increase in competition from developing countries is one of the several reasons why we have determined to lease our manufacturing operations in mexico 
our ability to import products in a timely and cost effective manner may also be affected by problems at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers  such as labor disputes 
these problems could require us to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to our customers 
these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs  which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition 
our dependence on independent manufacturers reduces our ability to control the manufacturing process  which could harm our sales  reputation and overall profitability 
we depend on independent contract manufacturers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity in an environment characterized by declining prices  continuing cost pressure and increased demands for product innovation and speed to market 
this dependence could subject us to difficulty in obtaining timely delivery of products of acceptable quality 
in addition  a contractor s failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers 
the failure to make timely deliveries may cause our customers to cancel orders  refuse to accept deliveries  impose non compliance charges through invoice deductions or other charge backs  demand reduced prices or reduce future orders  any of which could harm our sales  reputation and overall profitability 
we do not have material long term contracts with any of our independent contractors and any of these contractors may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time 
to the extent we are not able to secure or maintain relationships with independent contractors that are able to fulfill our requirements  our business would be harmed 
although we monitor the compliance of our independent contractors with applicable labor laws  we do not control our contractors or their labor practices 
the violation of federal  state or foreign labor laws by one of the our contractors could result in our being subject to fines and our goods that are manufactured in violation of such laws being seized or their sale in interstate commerce being prohibited 
from time to time  we have been notified by federal  state or foreign authorities that certain of our contractors are the subject of investigations or have been found to have violated applicable labor laws 
to date  we have not been subject to any sanctions that  individually or in the aggregate  have had a material adverse effect on our business  and we are not aware of any facts on which any such sanctions could be based 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the future we will not be subject to sanctions as a result of violations of applicable labor laws by our contractors  or that such sanctions will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  certain of our customers  including the limited  require strict compliance by their apparel manufacturers  including us  with applicable labor laws and visit our facilities often 
there can be no assurance that the violation of applicable labor laws by one of our contractors will not have a material adverse effect on our relationship with our customers 
our business is subject to risks of operating in a foreign country and trade restrictions 
approximately of our products were imported from outside the us in fiscal  and most of our fixed assets are located in mexico 
we are subject to the risks associated with doing business and owning fixed assets in foreign countries  including  but not limited to  transportation delays and interruptions  political instability  expropriation  currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs  import and export controls  other non tariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas and cultural issues 
any changes in those countries labor laws and government regulations may have a negative effect on our profitability 
we cannot guarantee that our future acquisitions will be successful 
in the future  we may seek to grow through acquisition 
we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with companies which have significantly greater financial and management resources than us 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition or investment opportunities will be identified  that any of these transactions can be consummated  or that  if acquired  these new businesses can be integrated successfully and profitably into our operations 
these acquisitions and investments may also require a significant allocation of resources  which will reduce our ability to focus on the other portions of our business  including many of the factors listed in the prior risk factor 
risk associated with our industry our sales are heavily influenced by general economic cycles 
apparel is a cyclical industry that is heavily dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending 
purchases of apparel and related goods tend to be highly correlated with cycles in the disposable income of our consumers 
our customers anticipate and respond to adverse changes in economic conditions and uncertainty by reducing inventories and canceling orders 
as a result  any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions  increases in interest rates  acts of war  terrorist or political events that diminish consumer spending and confidence in any of the regions in which we compete  could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
this has been underscored by the events of september  and the war in the middle east 
our business is highly competitive and depends on consumer spending patterns 
the apparel industry is highly competitive 
we face a variety of competitive challenges including o anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands  o developing innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes  o competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value  and o providing strong and effective marketing support 
we must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies retail and customer demand in a timely manner 
the apparel business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences dictated in part by fashion and season 
to the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise  our sales may be adversely affected 
our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing fashion trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design  merchandising and marketing staff 
competition for these personnel is intense  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods 
our business is subject to seasonal trends 
historically  our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
this trend is dependent on numerous factors  including the markets in which we operate  holiday seasons  consumer demand  climate  economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our historic operating patterns will continue in future periods as we cannot influence or forecast many of these factors 
other risks related to an investment in our common stock the ultimate resolution of the internal revenue service s examination of our tax returns may require us to incur an expense beyond what has been reserved for on our balance sheet or make cash payments beyond what we are then able to pay 
in january  the internal revenue service proposed adjustments to increase our federal income tax payable for the years ended december  through by an aggregate of approximately million 
this adjustment would also result in additional state taxes  penalties and interest of approximately million 
if the proposed adjustments are upheld through the administrative and legal process  they could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flow 
we believe we have provided adequate reserves for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters on the balance sheet included in the consolidated financial statements 
if the amount of any actual liability  however  exceeds our reserves  we would experience an immediate adverse earnings impact in the amount of such additional liability  which could be material 
additionally  we anticipate that the ultimate resolution of these matters will require that we make significant cash payments to the taxing authorities 
presently we do not have sufficient cash or borrowing ability to make any future payments that may be required 
while we intend to accumulate a cash reserve to meet this cash outflow contingency from operations  no assurance can be given that we will have sufficient surplus cash from operations to build and maintain this reserve by the time such payments are required 
additionally  cash used to build this reserve will not be available for other corporate purposes  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the failure to establish financial covenants under our credit facility in a timely manner would result in a default under our credit agreements  which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
our credit agreement with gmac requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants  including minimum levels of tangible net worth  interest coverage  fixed charge ratio and leverage ratio  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have agreed with gmac to set new financial covenants for fiscal based on our projections 
in the event that the financial covenants cannot be timely established on terms acceptable to gmac on or prior to may   such failure would be an event of default under the credit agreement 
in addition  due to cross default provisions in a majority of our debt agreements  approximately of our long term debt would become due in full if any of the debt is in default 
we have provided gmac with our projections and other necessary information in connection with setting the new financial covenants  and are otherwise fully cooperating with gmac on this matter 
however  there can be no guarantee that such financial covenants will be established prior to the deadline  or that gmac will not in its discretion establish financial covenants with which we are unable to comply 
if the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated and becomes due and payable prior to maturity  our default will entitle the creditors to exercise all of their rights and remedies  including foreclosure on all of our assets which we pledged as collateral to secure repayment of the debt 
insiders own a significant portion of our common stock  which could limit our shareholders ability to influence the outcome of key transactions 
as of march   our executive officers and directors and their affiliates owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
gerard guez  our chief executive officer and chairman  and todd kay  our vice chairman  alone own approximately and  respectively  of the outstanding shares of our common stock at march  accordingly  our executive officers and directors have the ability to affect the outcome of  or exert considerable influence over  all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election and removal of directors and any change in control 
this concentration of ownership of our common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or otherwise discouraging or preventing a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us 
this  in turn  could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
it could also prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock 
we have adopted a number of anti takeover measures that may depress the price of our common stock 
our shareholders rights plan  our ability to issue additional shares of preferred stock and some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to make an unsolicited takeover attempt of us 
these anti takeover measures may depress the price of our common stock by making it more difficult for third parties to acquire us by offering to purchase shares of our stock at a premium to its market price 
our stock price has been volatile 
our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market system  and there can be substantial volatility in the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including quarterly variations in operating results  operating results which vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  changes in financial estimates  changes in market valuations of competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of a material nature  loss of one or more customers  additions or departures of key personnel  future sales of common stock and stock market price and volume fluctuations 
in addition  general political and economic conditions such as a recession  or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock 
often  price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company 
if we were subject to this type of litigation in the future  we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 
any adverse determination in this type of litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
absence of dividends could reduce our attractiveness to you 
some investors favor companies that pay dividends  particularly in general downturns in the stock market 
we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth  and we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
additionally  we cannot pay dividends on our common stock unless the terms of our bank credit facilities and outstanding preferred stock  if any  permit the payment of dividends on our common stock 
because we may not pay dividends  your return on this investment likely depends on your selling our stock at a profit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of doing business in mexico as well as certain debt denominated in the euro 
as a result  we bear the risk of exchange rate gains and losses that may result in the future as a result of this financing 
at times we use forward exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations of foreign currencies on purchases and commitments 
these short term assets and commitments are principally related to trade payables positions and fixed asset purchase obligations 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we actively evaluate the creditworthiness of the financial institutions that are counter parties to derivative financial instruments  and we do not expect any counter parties to fail to meet their obligations 
interest rate risk 
because our obligations under our various credit agreements bear interest at floating rates primarily libor rates  we are sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates 
any major increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect our financial instruments would have a material impact on earning or cash flows during the next fiscal year 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect interest paid on our debt 
a majority of our credit facilities are at variable rates
