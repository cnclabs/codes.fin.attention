item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto referenced in item overview amedisys is a leading provider of home health nursing services 
the company generates revenue and profits primarily by providing medicare eligible patients with home health care services and also by delivering these services to insurance companies  managed care organizations and self insured employers 
the company s services are delivered in the various geographic markets served by the company hours per day  days per week  and are delivered through operating locations as at december  and as at the date hereof 
approximately of amedisys revenue are generated from a single payor the medicare program  with the balance derived from commercial insurers and state medicaid programs 
the medicare program is subject to legislative and other risk factors that can result in fluctuating reimbursement rates for the company s services 
despite these risks  the company believes it can operate effectively by increasing its volume of medicare patients  and implementing new business processes  and utilizing technology  to make the company an increasingly efficient provider of services 
there are several factors  which lead the company to believe it can continue to grow in the marketplace 
these include the cost of a home health care visit can be significantly lower than the cost of an average day in a hospital  the demand for home health care is expected to grow  primarily due to an aging population as well as patient preference  and a highly fragmented industry with many smaller competitors 
in order to take advantage of these trends  the company s strategic approach is to focus on employees  expand the range and scope of services offered  enhance disease management capabilities  and utilize improved technology wherever possible 
results from this strategic approach are reflected in amedisys fiscal financial performance 
the company reported fiscal net service revenue of million  an increase of on fiscal  and earnings per diluted share of  significantly higher than fiscal during fiscal  the company reported cash flow from operations of million  an increase of from fiscal in addition  the company issued stock in a private placement of common stock in november resulting in net cash proceeds of million

the critical accounting policies presented below have been discussed with the audit committee as to the development and selection of the accounting estimates used as well as the disclosures provided herein 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition medicare revenue recognition under the medicare prospective payment system pps  the company is paid by medicare based on episodes of care 
an episode of care is defined as a length of care up to sixty days with multiple continuous episodes allowed 
a base episode payment is established by the medicare program through federal legislation for all episodes of care ended on or after the applicable time periods detailed below period base episode payment beginning october  through march   per episode april  through september   per episode october  through september   per episode october  through september   per episode october  through march   per episode april  through december   per episode based on current legislation with respect to medicare reimbursement changes  the applicability of the reimbursement change is dependent upon the completion date of the episode  therefore  changes in reimbursement  both positive and negative  will impact the financial results of the company up to sixty days in advance of the effective date 
the base episode payment is adjusted by applicable regulations including  but not limited to  the following a case mix adjuster consisting of eighty home health resource groups hhrg  the applicable geographic wage index  low utilization either expected or unexpected  intervening events and other factors 
the episode payment is also adjusted in the event that a patient is either readmitted by the company  or admitted to another home health agency prior to the expiration of days from the original admission date these adjustments are known as partial episode payments 
the episode payment will be made to providers regardless of the cost to provide care 
the services covered by the episode payment include all disciplines of care  in addition to medical supplies  within the scope of the home health benefit 
a portion of reimbursement from for each medicare episode is billed and cash is typically received before all services are rendered 
the estimated episodic payment is billed at commencement of the episode 
sixty percent of the estimated reimbursement is received at initial billing for the initial episode of care per patient and fifty percent for is received at initial billing for subsequent episodes of care 
the remaining reimbursement is received upon completion of the episode 
revenue is recorded when services are provided to a patient 
billings are typically not collected until services are provided 
amounts billed and  or received in advance of services performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
the amount of deferred revenue at december  and was  and  respectively 
these deferred revenue amounts have been recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet since only a nominal amount of deferred revenue is cash collected in advance of providing services 
for episodes of care that are completed  all of the revenue expected to be received for that episode is recognized 
the amount of revenue recognized for episodes of care which are incomplete at period end is based on an estimate of the portion of the episode which applies to the period  and is calculated based upon total visits performed to date as a percentage of total expected visits for a particular episode 
management believes that this is a reasonable estimate for revenue with respect to services provided for incomplete episodes  and for which reimbursement will be ultimately received 
because of the potential for changes in base episode payments referred to above and the complexity of the regulations noted above  the estimated amounts originally recorded as net patient revenue and accounts receivable may be subject to revision as additional information becomes known 
during  cms informed providers that it intended to make certain recoveries of amounts overpaid to providers for the periods dating from the implementation of pps on october  through particular dates in 
table of contents and the first of these amounts related to partial episode payments peps whereby a patient was readmitted to a home health care agency prior to the passing of days from the previous admission date at another home health agency 
in such instances  reimbursement for the first agency is reduced 
cms advised the industry that cms had recently implemented changes to its computer system to adjust at the time of claim submission on an ongoing basis  and that recovery for prior overpayments would commence in the summer of and extend over a two year period 
the company reserved  based on information supplied by cms  approximately  in for all claims dating from october  secondly  cms advised the industry that it would seek recovery of overpayments that were made for patients who had  within days of such admission  been discharged from inpatient facilities  including hospitals  rehabilitation and skilled nursing units  and that these recoveries would commence in april  the company conducted an analysis of a representative sample of claims where these events had occurred  and estimated that  for all periods dating from october  through december   a reserve in the amount of approximately million was appropriate 
these reserves are recorded in current portion of medicare liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
prior to the implementation of pps on october   reimbursement for home health care services to patients covered by the medicare program was based on reimbursement of allowable costs subject to certain limits 
final reimbursement was determined after submission of annual cost reports and audits thereof by the fiscal intermediaries 
retroactive adjustments have been accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services were rendered and will be adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined 
estimated settlements for cost report years ended and subsequent years  which are still subject to audit by the intermediary and the department of health and human services  are recorded in short term and long term medicare liabilities 
under the new pps rules  annual cost reports are still required as a condition of participation in the medicare program 
however  there are no final settlements or retroactive adjustments 
non medicare revenue recognition the company has agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to the company at amounts different from its established rates 
gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to the company s established rates or estimated reimbursement rates  as applicable 
allowances and contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between the established rates and the amounts estimated to be payable by third parties and are deducted from gross revenue to determine net service revenue 
net service revenue are the estimated net amounts realizable from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered  including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements 
reimbursement from all sources except medicare is primarily billed and revenue is recorded as services are rendered and based upon discounts from established rates 
collectibility of accounts receivable the process for estimating the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable involves judgment  with the greatest subjectivity relating to non medicare accounts receivable 
the company currently records an allowance for uncollectible accounts on a percentage of revenue basis unless a specific issue is noted  at which time an additional allowance may be recorded 
in the fourth quarter of  the company terminated a number of contracts with non medicare payors and recorded an additional allowance of  given the uncertain nature of collectibility in relation to these contracts 
in the year ended december   accounts receivable increased  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  to million from million at december  this increase was due to delays in billing associated with the previously discussed acquisitions  and offset by the implementation by the company  in the first quarter of  of more frequent billing to medicare 

table of contents prior to october  the company outsourced billing and collection activities to caresouth home health services  inc caresouth 
effective this date  the company elected to terminate the agreement with caresouth and conduct these activities under its own managerial direction 
the company recruited staff to fulfill this function  as well as to review all medicare episodes of care for completeness prior to billing 
the company also staffed a department to reconcile adjustments to billing made by medicare with the objective of increasing the efficiency of the collection process 
the ability to obtain accurate billing information due to closer integration of caregivers and billing staff caused more accurate bills to be submitted to medicare 
improvements to the billing software allowed more timely  and more frequent  billing to medicare 
the ability of staff to conduct any required review claims denied by medicare via the computer system also improved the timeliness of collections 
medicare regulations allow for payment of of the anticipated episodic payment on initial episodes and of the anticipated episodic payment on subsequent episodes  within days of an electronic submission of the request  with the balance payable within days of completion of the necessary paperwork at the completion of the episode 
accounts receivable as at december  by payor class is as follows medicare  net of deferred revenue medicaid private total amounts receivable from state medicaid agencies and private insurers are significantly more difficult to collect  in particular because all billing is done on a per visit basis resulting in a number of smaller accounts 
in late the company ceased servicing a number of private insurance companies as a result of these difficulties 
insurance and litigation reserves the company is obligated for certain costs under various insurance programs  including employee health and welfare  workers compensation and professional liability  and while the company maintains various insurance programs to cover these risks  it is self insured for a substantial portion of the potential claims 
the company recognizes its obligations associated with these costs in the period in which a claim is incurred  including with respect to both reported claims  and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits 
these costs have generally been estimated based on historical data  industry statistics  the company s claims experience and actuarial analysis provided by the company s insurance agents 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
in the case of potential liability with respect to professional liability  employment  or other matters where litigation is involved  or where no insurance coverage is available  the company s policy is to utilize advice from both internal and external counsel as to the likelihood and amount of any potential cost to amedisys 
this advice is reviewed regularly by both internal staff  and on a quarterly basis  the company s audit committee 
goodwill and other intangible assets in july  the fasb issued financial accounting standards statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas that was effective january  under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no

table of contents long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement also supersedes certain aspects of apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported in discontinued operations in the period incurred rather than as of the measurement date as previously required by apb additionally  certain dispositions may now qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
the company reviews goodwill and other intangible assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether impairment has occurred  and if so  what impairment charge would be appropriate 
income taxes the company utilizes the asset and liability approach to measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company s deferred tax calculation requires management to make certain estimates about future operations 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company s principal source of liquidity is the collection of its account receivable  in particular under the medicare program 
the company s operating activities provided million in cash during the year ended december  whereas such activities provided million in cash during the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities in is primarily attributable to net income of million  non cash items such as depreciation and amortization of million  provision for bad debts of million  increase in accrued expenses of million  deferred income tax change of million offset by an increase in patients accounts receivable of million investing activities used million for the year ended december   whereas such activities used million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities in is primarily attributed to purchases of property and equipment of million and cash used in acquisitions of million

this includes short term medicare liabilities of million  million of which the company does not expect to fully liquidate in cash during these medicare liabilities include million owed by a subsidiary currently in bankruptcy  and million of anticipated cost report settlements yet to be finalized 
management does not expect the final cost report settlements to all occur in the coming year 
in addition  when the cost reports are settled  the company is entitled to apply for a payment plan for up to five years in length 
there can be no assurance that such a payment plan can be granted 
the company has certain other contingencies and reserves  including litigation reserves  recorded as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
that management may not be required to liquidate in cash during however  in the event that all current liabilities become due within twelve months  the company may be required to obtain debt financing and or sell securities on unfavorable terms 
there can be no assurance that such action may not be necessary to ensure appropriate liquidity for the operations of the company 
subsequent to year end  the company announced the acquisition of eleven home health and two hospice agencies see note to the consolidated financial statements for a total of million  and as a result  subsequent consolidated balance sheets of the company may reflect a working capital deficit

as of december   the company estimates an aggregate payable to medicare of million  all of which is reflected as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet 
the corresponding amount at december  was million  of which million was classified as a current liability  and million as a long term medicare liability 
this amount includes million reserved during as outlined above see revenue recognition 

table of contents the recorded million also includes a million obligation of a subsidiary of the company which is currently in bankruptcy  and it is not clear whether the company will have any responsibility for that amount if the debt of the subsidiary is discharged in bankruptcy 
prior to the implementation of pps on october   the company recorded medicare revenue at the lower of actual costs  the per visit cost limit  or a per beneficiary cost limit on an individual provider basis 
under the previous medicare cost based reimbursement system  ultimate reimbursement under the medicare program was determined upon final settlement of the annual cost reports 
the million remaining balance due medicare reflects the company s estimate of amounts likely to be assessed by medicare as overpayments in respect of prior years when medicare audits of the company s cost reports from through october  are completed 
at the time these audits are completed and final assessments are issued  the company may apply to medicare for repayment over a thirty six month or longer period  although there is no assurance that such applications will be agreed to 
these amounts relate to the medicare payment system in effect until october  under which medicare provided periodic interim payments to the company  subject to audit of cost reports submitted by the company and repayment of any overpayments by medicare to the company 
the fiscal intermediary  acting on behalf of medicare  is entitled to reopen settled cost reports for up to three years after issuing final assessments 
in december  congress passed the benefits improvement and protection act bipa  which  among other things  allowed providers a one time advance equal to two periodic interim payments pip 
these advances were repayable to medicare over a thirty six month period and bore interest at 
the company received million from medicare under this provision in bipa at which time a liability was established as an amount due to medicare 
of the balance remaining at december   the amounts due within twelve months are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet at december  in the current portion of medicare liabilities  with the balance reflected in the long term medicare liabilities line item of the consolidated balance sheet 
the company has subsequently repaid this debt to medicare 
during the second quarter of the company revised the calculation of the estimated medicare allowable costs for the cost report year based on additional information provided by the fiscal intermediary to the company resulting in a million decrease in amounts due to medicare 
such amounts were recorded as an increase to revenue in the second quarter of also in the fourth quarter of  cms completed audits of the filed cost reports for the cost report year 
based information received from the completed audits  the company determined that the audit adjustment factor  withheld from the initial review conducted by the intermediary in  would be refunded less any additional audit adjustments 
based on guidance received from the intermediary  the fiscal provider cost reports for those providers the company purchased from columbia hca in december  were to receive an additional month of costs because the intermediary allowed the company to file a month cost report 
even though amedisys did have unfavorable audit adjustments  the net effect of the additional allowable cost and the refunded audit adjustment factor resulted in a net receivable from medicare 
as a result of this information  the company reversed the previously established million due to medicare for the audit adjustment factor with an increase to revenue in the fourth quarter of during the third and fourth quarters of  the company received cash settlements of million from medicare related to tentative settlements of the fy fiscal cost reports 
this receivable was netted against the amounts due to medicare on the balance sheet in the current portion of medicare liabilities  therefore  receipts of these settlements had no statement of operations impact 
in october the company received notice from cms that the fy fiscal amedisys cost reports were being re opened 
in response to this notification from the intermediary  the company established a liability of million for amounts that may be assessed during the re opening of the cost reports  due to the 
table of contents potential for different interpretations of reimbursement regulations between the intermediary and the company 
the increase in liability resulted in a charge against revenue in the fourth quarter of cms has yet to complete the audit on these cost reports 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company received cash settlements of million from medicare related to the settlements of the fy fiscal cost reports 
this receivable was netted against the amounts due to medicare on the balance sheet in the current portion of medicare liabilities  therefore  receipts of these settlements had no statement of operation impact

in november  the company elected to terminate its asset financing facility with npf vi see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and advised its payors that remittances should be directed to the bank accounts of the company rather than bank accounts controlled by npf vi under collateral arrangements for the facility 
the decision to terminate the above facility was made in response to the failure of npf vi to provide million on october  as requested by the company on october  in accordance with the terms of the facility 
at that date  amedisys  inc determined that an amount of approximately million was being held on behalf of the company by npf vi  and engaged in correspondence with representatives of npf vi in an effort to have these funds returned to the company 
on november   npf vi filed bankruptcy petitions  and accordingly  the company elected to reserve the amount of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company is taking legal and other action to have this collateral released  and to recover the funds that have not been released to the company 
the company incurred approximately million in legal fees related to this matter in the period ended december   and may incur substantial legal expenses in the future 
should the company be ultimately unable to recover the million held by npf vi within a reasonable timeframe or be unable to obtain alternative financing on reasonable terms  certain opportunities of the company could be constrained  such as prepayment of debt to reduce interest costs  taking advantage of alternative financing arrangements relative to its insurance needs  and pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities 
moreover  if the company cannot recover the funds and should there be unexpected cash requirements
