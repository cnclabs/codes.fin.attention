item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this report 
introduction ct communications  inc and its subsidiaries provide a broad range of telecommunications and related services to residential and business customers located primarily in north carolina 
our primary services include local and long distance telephone service  internet and data services and digital wireless products and services 
the company has worked to expand its core businesses through the development of integrated product and service offerings  investment in growth initiatives that exceed certain return thresholds and targeted marketing efforts to efficiently identify and obtain customers 
in addition  the company has made certain strategic investments that complement our business units 
during  the company expanded its wireless business through the partitioning of its area of the cingular digital networks 
the company believes that it is positioning itself to achieve its strategic objectives by devoting substantial effort to developing business plans  enhancing our management team and board of directors  and designing and developing our business support and operating systems 
the company s primary focus is to maximize the ilec business in its current markets by cross selling bundled products and packages and growing its customer base through its clec  greenfield  internet and data services  and digital wireless businesses 
the company will also consider strategic acquisitions and investments as opportunities arise 
net income for the company was million in compared to million in and million in income from continuing operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were  and in  and respectively 
overall  was a strong year for the company as revenue increased across all operating segments and the company s competitive businesses showed improved operating margins 
the company s ilec experienced a loss of access lines as its customers can select from several alternative service providers 
the competitive clec and greenfield wireline businesses continued to experience strong demand for their products and services in that resulted in and access line growth  respectively 
the replacement of higher margin ilec lines with lower margin clec and greenfield lines will continue to pressure operating margins downward 
however  the company is continuously evaluating opportunities for process improvements and efficiency gains to offset the transition to competitive  lower margin accounts 
operating margins in the clec and greenfield businesses should continue to be positively impacted as we leverage existing transport infrastructure to support new customers 
industry and operating trends the telecommunications industry continues to evolve into a highly competitive business faced with the challenge of evolving their organizations  services  processes and systems that are capable of successfully competing for and retaining customers 
our ilec is facing more competitive pressure than any other time in its year history 
wireless providers and clec s have targeted our customers and will continue to promote low cost  flexible communications alternatives 
the more recent introduction of cable telephony and voip services will become more significant threats to our voice business in the coming years 
these technologies are capable of delivering a quality  competitive voice service to our ilec customers at a lower cost 
these voice providers are not subject to certain regulatory constraints that have shaped our business model and that will become more significant impediments to our ability to successfully compete in the coming years 
in particular  our ilec must provide certain basic services to all customers in our regulated service area  regardless of the cost to provide that service 
we are the beneficiaries of certain cost reimbursements that are intended to offset certain costs to provide service 
these reimbursements are increasingly at risk and being reduced  yet our service obligations remain unchanged 
the future risk and uncertainty of regulatory service requirements and the recovery of expense subsidies will impact our ability to maintain existing margins and profitability 
as discussed above  voip and cable telephony are becoming more available to customers and could result in lower revenues throughout our businesses 
time warner currently offers cable television and high speed internet service and is expected to offer cable telephony in our ilec service area  which could result in a loss of access lines  a reduction in ilec revenue including long distance revenue  and a reduction in internet revenue 
in addition  wireless substitution is also a trend that is impacting our ilec business as well as our long distance revenue 
some customers are choosing to substitute their landline service with wireless service 
we believe this has contributed to the access line decrease in the ilec over the past several years 
also impacting access line losses over the past several years is the adoption of dsl and high speed internet services by customers that had traditionally subscribed to dial up internet service 
as customers switch to dsl or high speed internet service  they no longer need a second landline for use with their dial up internet service 
during we experienced a decline in the recovery of wireless interconnection access fee revenue 
we expect continued pressure from other telecommunications providers to lower and ultimately eliminate our recovery of fees for terminating their traffic into our network 
in our wireless business  increasing competition  market saturation and an uncertain economy have caused and will likely continue to cause the wireless industry s subscriber growth rate to moderate in comparison to historical growth rates 
while the wireless telecommunications industry does continue to grow  a high degree of competition exists among carriers 
this competition will continue to put pressure upon pricing and margins as carriers compete for potential customers 
future carrier revenue growth is highly dependent upon the number of net customer additions a carrier can achieve and the average revenue per user derived from its customers 
regulatory requirements have grown in certain areas of our business and have added complexity and expense to our business model 
in november  we were required to provide number portability to wireless carriers 
this service allows greater customer choice in their telecommunications provider  without the need to change established end user contact numbers 
while this service certainly enhances customer choice  it negatively impacts our cost to provide basic service 
as federal and state agencies continue their pursuit of opening all telecommunications services to competition  additional expenses are likely to be incurred by the established local exchange carriers to facilitate more open networks 
critical accounting policies and estimates ct communications discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company continuously evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  restructuring charges  long lived assets  investments  income taxes  pensions and post retirement benefits  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements included herein describes our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when services are provided regardless of the period in which they are billed 
revenues from sales of telephone equipment are recognized upon delivery to the customer for direct sale leases while revenues from sales type leases are recognized upon delivery to the customer in an amount equal to the present value of the minimum rental payments under the fixed non cancelable lease term 
the deferred finance charges applicable to these leases are recognized over the terms of the leases using the effective interest method 
installation fees are deferred and the related costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the customer in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
certain interstate rates charged by the company are regulated by the fcc and may be subject to potential over earnings claims if the company s interstate rates result in earnings over the fcc s prescribed rate of return 
the company maintains a reserve related to over earnings based on management s estimate of potential liability for the company 
management periodically assesses the company s potential liability and makes adjustments as applicable 
changes in management s estimate could result from changes in current and future legislation  regulatory filings and fcc rulings  as well as any other factors that may impact management s estimate 
the company also participates in a revenue pooling arrangement with other local exchange carriers administered by neca 
revenue earned through this pooling arrangement is initially recorded based on the company s estimates and revised as settlements are finalized 
the company periodically makes claims for recovery of certain amounts related to access charges on certain minutes of use terminated by the company on behalf of other carriers 
management believes these claims that have not been accepted by other carriers have merit and there will be a resolution in the future regarding these claims 
however  management is unable to estimate the recovery and is not reasonably assured of collection 
as a result of this uncertainty  the company has not recorded revenue for these items 
upon assurance of collectability  the company will recognize revenue in the period that assurance or collection occurs 
wireless revenues are recognized in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
based on eitf  the company has determined that the sale of wireless services through its direct sales channel with an accompanying handset constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables 
wireless activation fees are recognized as revenue at the time of activation 
restructuring charges we periodically record charges resulting from restructuring operations  including consolidations and or relocations of operations  changes in our strategic plan  or managerial responses to declines in demand  increasing costs  or other environmental factors 
the company announced its intent to discontinue its wireless broadband trial and recognized a loss of approximately million in to write down the related carrying amounts of assets to their fair values less cost to sell and recorded related liabilities for estimated severance costs  lease termination costs  and other exit costs in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in restructuring 
the determination of restructuring charges requires management s judgment and may include costs related to employee benefits  such as costs of severance and termination benefits  and costs for future lease commitments of excess facilities  net of estimated future sublease income 
in determining the amount of the facilities charge  we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates 
these estimates will be reviewed and potentially revised on a quarterly basis based on known real estate market conditions and the credit worthiness of subtenants  resulting in revisions to established facility reserves 
long lived assets we continually evaluate the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment in computing depreciation expense 
consideration is given to technological advances and utilization of our existing facilities 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  and accordingly  we no longer amortize goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  changes in technology  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 
our net goodwill and other intangible assets totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we performed an initial review of goodwill and other intangible assets upon adoption of sfas no 
and will perform reviews annually thereafter as of december no impairment charges were required at december  and investments we hold certain investments and investment securities that we evaluate to determine whether unrealized losses are other than temporary 
we perform this evaluation quarterly by comparing market price of the investments and securities to the current recorded value 
based on this evaluation and consideration of other factors  we determine the classification of unrealized losses and record charges to adjust the carrying value of these investments 
we also hold certain other investments and investments in unconsolidated companies that we evaluate to determine if the investment is impaired 
the determination of fair market value is based on historical and projected information regarding the investment and on management s estimates 
if it is determined that the fair market value of the investment is less than the current recorded value then we record charges to adjust the carrying value of these investments 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
net deferred tax liabilities at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company has recognized a valuation allowance of million and million at december  and  respectively 
pension and post retirement benefits the decline in equity markets in recent years coupled with record low interest rates have negatively impacted companies with defined benefit pension plans 
these factors have decreased plan assets that are available to pay plan benefits at the same time the cost of providing benefits has increased 
we used a discount rate of in valuing our december  pension and post retirement benefit obligations 
in addition  we have assumed a long term expected return on assets 
the pension benefit obligation increased to approximately million with plan assets at december  valued at million 
this compares with a benefit obligation of million at december   with plan assets valued at million 
although difficult to predict because of the relation to market performance  we do not anticipate making a cash contribution to meet minimum required funding thresholds in the post retirement benefit obligation related to the company s health care plan that provides post retirement medical benefits and life insurance coverage to certain employees was million at december  and is not funded by the company 
the company has adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  and is amortizing the estimated transition liability over years 
allowance for doubtful accounts management judgment is required in assessing the collectability of customer accounts and other receivables 
we accordingly maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations  guarantees or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that have  or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
results of operations we have identified reportable segments based on the common characteristics of products and services and or the customers served 
the identified reportable segments are ilec  clec  greenfield  digital wireless  internet and data services ids and palmetto mobilenet 
all other businesses that do not meet reporting guidelines and thresholds are reported under other business units 
we have a limited partnership interest in palmetto mobilenet that is accounted for as an equity investment 
palmetto mobilenet s financial statements are included on pages f through f of this report 
the following discussion reviews the results of our consolidated operations and specific results within each reportable segment 
consolidated operating results in thousands  except lines and subscribers total operating revenue total operating expense operating income depreciation and amortization capital expenditures total assets ending wired access lines ending wireless subscribers compared to operating revenue increased million or for the year ended december  when compared to the increase is attributable to a million increase in clec revenue driven primarily by an increase in access lines  a million increase in wireless revenue driven by a increase in customers and an increase in network traffic  a million increase in greenfield revenue driven by a increase in greenfield access lines  a million increase in ilec revenue and a million increase in ids revenue 
overall  total operating revenue increased in all operating segments in compared to in  the company s ilec recognized million in additional interstate revenue from neca related to icls support and a common line revenue pooling arrangement 
these sources of revenue may or may not be received in the future 
in addition  during  the company recorded adjustments to its reserves for over earnings claims 
certain interstate rates charged by the company are regulated by the fcc and may be subject to potential over earnings claims if the company s interstate rates result in earnings over the fcc s prescribed rate of return 
the company maintains a reserve related to over earnings based on management s estimate of potential liability for the company 
during  the company recorded a net adjustment to these reserves that increased operating revenue by approximately million 
in  the company recorded a net adjustment that decreased operating revenue by million 
as of december   the company s total over earnings reserve is approximately million 
management periodically assesses the company s potential liability and makes adjustments as applicable 
changes in management s estimate could result from changes in current and future legislation  regulatory filings and fcc rulings  as well as any other factors that may impact management s estimate 
we have diversified operating revenue in the company significantly over the past two years due to the growth in our competitive businesses 
for  ilec revenue represented of total revenue compared to in  while digital wireless has grown to of total revenue  up from in  the combined clec and greenfield businesses have grown to of total revenue up from in and internet revenue represented of total revenue in both and in  operating expense increased million or as compared to this increase is primarily the result of increases in depreciation expense of million  increases in compensation and benefit expenses  and increases in expenses related to customer growth including minutes of use in our clec  greenfield and wireless businesses 
our operating margin decreased slightly to in from in this reduction in operating margin is primarily due to the expansion of operations in our lower margin competitive businesses that have replaced higher margin ilec revenue 
compared to operating revenue increased million or for the year ended december  when compared to this increase in operating revenue is related primarily to two main factors a full year of digital wireless services after the partitioning of our wireless territory from cingular in june as compared to six months in and the continued significant growth of our customer base in our clec and greenfield businesses 
as a result of this growth in our competitive businesses we have diversified operating revenue in our company significantly over the past two years 
in  our ilec business represented of total operating revenue while our digital wireless represented  the combined clec and greenfield business represented and our internet business represented of total operating revenue 
in  the ilec represented of revenue while wireless had grown to of revenue  the combined clec and greenfield businesses had grown to of revenue and internet represented of revenue 
in  operating expense increased million or as compared to depreciation and amortization expense accounted for million of this increase due to several years of increased capital expenditures which included projects such as the partitioning of our wireless territory from cingular and the building of our new corporate headquarters facility 
the remaining million of the increase is related to the operation of our partitioned wireless business for a full year and the costs associated with the greater customer numbers in our clec and greenfield businesses  partially offset by internal efficiencies and cost control efforts 
as a result of the revenue growth and expense growth  operating margins improved to in after having fallen to in ilec in thousands  except lines total operating revenue total operating expense operating income depreciation expense capital expenditures total assets ending business access lines ending residential access lines ending total access lines ending long distance lines compared to operating revenue for the ilec increased million or for compared to the increase in revenue consists of a million increase in settlement revenue partially offset by a million decrease in cellular interconnection revenue  a million decrease in long distance revenue and a decrease in local revenue due to the decrease in access lines 
the primary reason for the increase in settlement revenue in is million in federal support received through neca and a million change in the company s over earnings reserves 
the decrease in access lines is partly due to an increase in dsl internet adoption by some of our customers which has lead the customers to cancel second lines previously used for dial up internet service as well as increased competition from wireless providers 
at december   approximately  second lines remain in service 
wireless interconnection revenue is likely to decline going forward as the company has been required to develop direct billing relationships with wireless carriers for termination of wireless traffic in our network 
this decline is due to migration of this traffic to direct billing arrangements subject to negotiated interconnection rates that are lower than rates previously realized for termination of this traffic 
the company believes that ilec revenue may decline up to million in due to this rate decline 
however  this rate decline will be somewhat offset as wireless traffic terminated on our network increases 
operating expense in the ilec increased million or for compared to the primary drivers of this increase were increases in compensation and benefits expense and increased depreciation expense  partially offset by a decrease in cellular interconnection expense 
operating expense continues to increase at a faster rate than operating revenue in resulting in a decline in operating margin from in to in the company will continue to focus on gaining operational efficiencies to offset lower revenue due to access lines losses 
capital expenditures in were of ilec operating revenue compared to of revenue in ilec access lines subscribing to our long distance service increased slightly in despite a access line loss 
at the end of  of ilec access lines subscribed to our long distance service  up from at year end despite the increase in ilec customers subscribing to our long distance service  long distance revenue has declined 
long distance minutes of use increased significantly in compared to however  increased competition has forced rates per minute down and as a result  long distance revenue has declined despite an increase in minutes of use and this trend is expected to continue 
compared to operating revenue for the ilec declined from million in to million in this decrease in revenue was mainly due to a corresponding decrease in access lines 
we attribute much of the line loss to the nearly penetration of our access line base with our dsl internet product  causing some of our access line customers to cancel second lines previously used for dial up internet service 
it is also believed that similar pressure on second lines is occurring from wireless carriers and cable modem internet service offered in our incumbent area by time warner 
the penetration of our incumbent base by our dsl product more than doubled in operating expense in the ilec declined at a slightly faster rate than operating revenue in boosting operating margin from in to in contributing to this margin increase was a million reduction in expense related to operational efficiencies offset by a million increase in depreciation costs related to capital spending on several significant projects 
an example of our focus on internal operating efficiencies is the decision  announced in the fourth quarter  to outsource operator services to a reliable industry specialist  a move that we estimate will save us over  per year beginning in capital expenditures declined in to of ilec operating revenue compared to in  due in part to the slowing new customer growth in our territory 
ilec access lines subscribing to our long distance service increased in despite the access line loss 
at the end of over of ilec access lines subscribed to our long distance service  up from at year end clec in thousands  except lines total operating revenue total operating expense operating income loss depreciation expense capital expenditures total assets ending access lines ending long distance lines compared to clec operating revenue was million in  representing a million or increase over the million increase consists of a million increase in recurring line revenue and a million increase in access revenue 
the increase in recurring line revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in access lines during the million increase in access revenue was due primarily to the collection of approximately million in previously disputed access fees in and an increase in minutes of use 
we have placed significant resources around revenue assurance activities to identify and collect access fees 
although revenue assurance efforts will continue at current levels  we are not likely to identify future opportunities consistent with our success in effective june   the fcc directed that switched access rates charged by clecs to long distance companies for interstate traffic be reduced from per minute to per minute 
the effect of this reduction lowered access revenue approximately million in clec operating expense was million and million in and  respectively 
our operating expense decreased slightly despite revenue growth of 
as a result  our operating margin increased to in compared to in the improvement in operating margins was due primarily to the increase in access lines and the collection of million of previously disputed access fee revenue 
we expect margins to continue to be positively impacted as we leverage existing transport infrastructure with new customers 
we did not enter any new markets in or  electing instead to focus on market penetration in our current markets and leverage existing transport infrastructure where possible 
our clec focuses on the metropolitan areas and communities immediately surrounding our ilec territory 
compared to clec operating revenue was million in  representing a million or increase over this increase is due to a increase in access lines during as well as a increase in clec long distance customers 
clec continued its steady growth within the charlotte and greensboro  north carolina markets  becoming a more significant carrier in the areas it serves 
clec operating expense was million in compared with million during our operating expense increased in  significantly less than the revenue growth resulting in an increase in operating margins from in to in operating expense increases in were principally related to the increase in our customer base  which impacted customer service  billing  transport and network costs 
greenfield in thousands  except lines and signed provider agreements total operating revenue total operating expense operating income loss depreciation expense capital expenditures total assets ending access lines ending long distance lines total signed provider agreements compared to greenfield revenue increased million in to million compared to million for this revenue increase is primarily attributable to a increase in access lines in related to the continued  but slower than expected  filling of developments covered by signed telecommunications provider agreements 
in addition  access revenue increased approximately million in as the minutes of use on our network increases with customer growth 
our greenfield business signed provider agreements in  bringing the total number of signed agreements to these agreements represent a potential  access lines once these developments have been completely built out 
the expected residential business line mix of these projects is expected to be residential and business 
operating expense increased in to million  related primarily to the increase in access lines and a million increase in depreciation expense 
the increase in access lines and related minutes of use on the company s network has resulted in million increase in combined access and transport expenses 
the increase in depreciation expense is associated with the up front capital expenditures required in most of the developments 
capital expenditures in decreased million for compared to  as the company continues its strategy of targeting new developments with the most efficient capital deployments 
at the end of  of greenfield access lines also subscribed to our long distance service  up from in this increase is mainly due to the fact that many of the early greenfield access lines were business lines located in mall projects 
business customers in malls historically do not elect our long distance service as frequently as residential customers since many retail businesses have national long distance contracts 
as the residential percentage of greenfield access lines increases we have seen our long distance penetration rates increase 
in june  the ncuc initiated a general inquiry involving all certificated telecommunications providers regarding provider contracts 
the ncuc is examining all telecommunications provider contracts filed by clecs and ilecs with the ncuc and hearings were held in late january the company has telecommunications provider contracts through its greenfield operations 
at this time  the impact of this inquiry on our business cannot be determined 
the greenfield segment is also subject to the switched access rates reduction affecting the company s clec 
the impact on greenfield is expected to be minimal and should be offset by increased levels of traffic as the company continues to build out its projects 
compared to greenfield revenue more than doubled in to million compared to million for this revenue increase is primarily attributable to a doubling in access lines in related to the continued  but slower than expected  build out of developments covered by signed telecommunications provider agreements 
included in this access line increase was the opening of the triangle town center mall in raleigh  the third destination mall served by our greenfield business 
our greenfield business signed provider agreements in  bringing the total number of signed agreements to these agreements represent a potential  access lines once these developments have been completely built out 
operating expense increased in to million  related to the increase in access lines and a million increase in depreciation expense associated with the significant initial capital expenditures required in most of the developments 
most of the increase in expense in related to the increasing customer base 
capital expenditures in were essentially flat with levels as projects representing  to  potential access lines were started each year 
at the end of  of greenfield access lines also subscribed to our long distance service  up from in this increase is mainly due to the fact that many of the early greenfield access lines were business lines located in mall projects 
business customers in malls historically do not elect our long distance service as frequently as residential customers since many retail businesses have national long distance contracts 
digital wireless in thousands  except subscribers total operating revenue total operating expense operating income depreciation and amortization capital expenditures total assets ending post pay subscribers compared to our digital wireless business saw operating revenue grow in compared to we continued our post pay wireless subscriber growth in by adding  net subscribers  an increase of compared to a growth rate in this acceleration of customer growth in led to an increase in recurring revenue of million in compared to also contributing to our increase in revenue during was increased settlement revenue of million related to a increase in the minutes of use on our wireless network from the end of to the end of and increased revenue from the sale of handsets and accessories of million 
operating expense increased in to million 
the primary drivers of the increase in operating expenses are increases in indirect commissions of million  handset and accessory costs of million and settlement expenses of million 
these expenses increased primarily due to the increase in post pay customers and the related increase in minutes of use on our network 
in addition  salary  benefits and bonus expenses increased approximately million  depreciation expense increased million and tower lease expenses increased million 
operating margins decreased to in compared to in this decrease is primarily due to an increase in selling and administrative expenses and an increase in depreciation expense 
capital expenditures were million in  primarily related to the addition of two new cell sites in our territory and the addition of capacity on selected other cell sites 
new cell site construction was down significantly from the sites constructed in our network is substantially built out and we anticipate that capital expenditures in future years associated with new sites to be reduced from historical levels 
in november  the fcc mandated that wireless carriers implement lnp 
there are several operational issues that were recently addressed by the fcc 
it is expected that wireless lnp could result in increased rates of customer churn 
compared to our digital wireless business saw operating revenue grow in as it completed its first full year after partitioning our portion of the cingular digital network in the summer of in  as part of the partitioning  the company acquired over  post pay subscribers and ended with over  post pay subscribers 
we continued our post pay wireless subscriber growth in by adding over  net subscribers  an increase of 
also contributing to our increase in revenue during was increased settlement revenue related to a increase in the minutes of use on our wireless network from the end of to the end of contributing to this increase in minutes of use was the addition of wireless cell sites in  as we significantly improved the coverage in our service territory 
operating expense increased in to million 
the addition of customers  the increase in minutes on our network  the opening of two new retail outlets and the signing of new indirect distributor agreements contributed to the increase in operating expense over capital expenditures were million in  primarily related to the addition of new cell sites in our territory and the addition of capacity on selected other cell sites 
these projects were largely one time projects related to the filling out of our service territory after the partitioning event 
internet and data services in thousands  except lines and accounts total operating revenue total operating expense operating income loss depreciation and amortization capital expenditures total assets ending dsl lines ending dial up accounts ending high speed accounts compared to ids operating revenue grew in to million 
during  the total number of dsl lines increased  which resulted in revenue from dsl service increasing million 
this increase is partially offset by decreases in dial up and high speed revenue of million and million  respectively 
in addition  the company announced in its intent to eliminate its web development activities  which resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately million in ids operating expense was million in  a increase compared to this increase relates primarily to costs associated with an increasing dsl customer base  increased depreciation expense and increased salary  benefits and bonus expenses  offset somewhat by a decrease in web development expense 
operating margins increased to in compared to in this increase is primarily due to the growth in dsl accounts 
dsl customers increased in to a total of  this represents a penetration rate of of combined greenfield and ilec access lines 
compared to ids operating revenue grew in to million 
during  we significantly decreased our web development activities and continued to convert many dial up internet customers to our dsl service 
the resulting decrease in web development and dial up revenue in was more than offset by increases in dsl and high speed revenue 
ids operating expense was million in  a decrease compared to this decrease relates to the reduction in our web development services  the increased focus on product margins  somewhat offset by costs associated with an increasing dsl customer base 
dsl customers more than doubled in each of and bringing total dsl lines in service to  at december  this represented a penetration rate of of combined greenfield and ilec access lines 
other business units in thousands total operating revenue total operating expense operating income loss depreciation and amortization capital expenditures total assets compared to operating expense for the company s other business units increased million in to million 
this million increase was related primarily to a million increase in depreciation due to the completion of our corporate headquarters  a million increase in property and franchise taxes and a million increase in compensation and benefit expenses 
the expenses of the other business units consist primarily of certain expenses that are not allocated to the operating segments 
capital expenditures in primarily include the building of our new corporate center 
compared to operating expense for the other units increased million in to million 
this increase was related primarily to a million increase in depreciation due to the completion of our corporate headquarters and million related to the inclusion of wonc in our consolidated results after our purchase of majority ownership in the spring of capital expenditures include the building of our new corporate center  information systems and software  property and other corporate capital expenditures 
the increase in total assets from to of million relates primarily to the consolidation of wonc 
other income compared to other income expense increased million in when compared to this increase relates to an increase of million in gains on sale of investments and an increase of million in equity in income of unconsolidated companies  partially offset by a million increase in impairment on investments and a million increase in other expenses 
the increase in gains on sale of investments was primarily attributable to the sale of the company s investment in itc holding  which resulted in a gain of million 
the increase in equity in income of unconsolidated companies is due to an increase in earnings of palmetto mobilenet 
compared to other income expense increased million in when compared to this increase relates to a decrease of million in investment impairments and a million reduction in gains on sales of investments from interest expense increased million in compared to due to higher debt levels 
in the fourth quarter of we recognized a million pre tax loss due to the write down of maxcom bringing total investment impairment charges to million in in  this number dropped dramatically as we experienced only million in total investment impairment charges  related to several marketable securities and other investments 
our debt increased through the end of due primarily to the investments we have made in our growth businesses 
as a result  interest expense has also increased 
in  other expenses  principally interest  were million  a million increase over liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december   and increased million during the increase in was primarily driven by positive working capital changes  recovery of certain prior year tax refunds and greater cash generated from operations
