item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis below contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements including statements regarding anticipated future sales  margin and expense levels  future tax rates  future cash flow and working capital requirements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors set forth under factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
all references to years are to fiscal years unless otherwise noted 
results of operations sales the company is organized into two product groups the safety products group spg and the automation products group apg 
group sales for the years ended december   and were spg apg sales in increased to million from million in sales by spg increased million or from to  as a result increases of in shipments of safety light curtains  in shipments of profiling scanner products  in interlock and relay shipments and in safety mat sales 
in addition  spg s machine services division msd recorded a increase in revenue 
sales by apg grew million or due to increases of  and in shipments of level products  control components and pressure products  respectively 
sales in increased to million from million in sales by spg increased from to this was the result of increased unit sales at the optical sensor division as well as the full year effect of sales by msd  which was acquired in june shipments of safety light curtains  profiling scanners and safety mats grew by   and  respectively  offsetting a decline in sales of interlocks and relays 
the full year effect of sales by msd accounted for approximately one third of the growth in sales by spg 
during  apg continued to be negatively impacted by economic conditions in the semiconductor industry and as a result  reported a decline in its sales  primarily in the pressure sensing product line 
the table below summarizes operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales for the most recent three years 
sales gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangibles total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss gross profit million million million increase in increase in our gross margin was of sales in compared to of sales in  as a result of a shift in the mix of products sold to those bearing a higher relative cost 
our gross profit in increased over  due to the increased sales 
this trend was reflected in the results recorded by both spg and apg 
our gross margin was of sales in and of sales in as we sold more higher margin products at the safety products division 
as a result of the higher level of shipments in  our gross profit increased over selling  general and administrative expenses million million million increase in change in selling general and administrative expenses increased million or in compared to this was primarily the result of higher marketing and selling costs associated with the expanded revenue 
in addition  apg recorded  in expenses relating to the consolidation of the bulk of our tulare  california operations into our logan  utah facility 
this consolidation was essentially completed in  with the exception of one small operation  which we expect to relocate in during  as a result of the cost reduction measures initiated in and continued in  we were able to keep our selling  general and administrative expenses at levels in absolute dollars in spite of a increase in sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses were and of sales in and compared to of sales in research and development expenses million million million decrease in decrease in product creation  development and enhancement have always been and continue to be an important factor in our long term success 
investments in this area enable us to serve the factory automation market with increasingly sophisticated sensors and manufacturing control products 
as a result of the above mentioned cost reduction measures and a lowering of our reliance on outside contractors  we were able to reduce our research and development expenditures by from to and from to in  and  we introduced a number of new products and product enhancements 
consistent with our dedication to the development of new products  we anticipate that the level of research and development expenses will remain constant in to date  all product development costs have been expensed as incurred 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and as a result of the losses sustained in  we recorded an income tax benefit of of the loss for the year 
we expect that our effective tax rate for will be reasonably consistent with and see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital needs have been met through funds generated from operating activities 
during  operating funds were provided by net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization and increased accrued expenses 
these operating funds were used to offset increases in accounts receivable  receivable from parent and inventories  to purchase fixed assets and to pay down our capital lease obligation 
working capital amounted to million at december   a increase from the million at december  our bank line of credit of million was renewed in and extended to june  we have an option to convert up to million of the credit line into a five year term note 
secured by qualified receivables  fixed assets and inventories  borrowings under this credit line bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
at december   none of the line of credit had been utilized 
we made certain capital expenditures during  primarily for production  quality assurance  research and development equipment  information systems and software 
consistent with our historical operations and our current plans for growth  we plan to make additional capital expenditures during  primarily for production  quality assurance and research and development equipment 
while we had no formal commitments at december   it is anticipated that capital expenditures in will be in excess of million  predicated on our profitability and cash resources 
we believe that cash flow from operations and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital requirements through at least while we continue to evaluate financing alternatives from time to time  we have no current plans to raise additional outside capital 
at december   future minimum payments under our leases due in the years and were approximately  and  and  each for the years through relationship with parent intercompany transactions between us and our parent company include charges to our parent for management services provided by us  dividend payments to our parent and other cash transfers 
our parent files a consolidated tax return including our accounts 
our tax provision or benefit is calculated on a stand alone basis 
our income taxes payable or receivable calculated on that basis are paid to or received from our parent 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenue from product sales to customers is recognized upon shipment when shipped fob our plant or upon receipt by the customer when shipped fob destination  if a signed purchase order exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is considered reasonably assured and product returns can be reasonably estimated 
subsequent to the sale of the products  we have no obligation to provide any modification or customization  upgrades  enhancements or postcontract customer support 
upon revenue recognition  we provide for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties 
we estimate sales returns and warranty costs based on historical experience and the best information we have at the time we report our financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
installation and engineering service revenue is recognized when services are rendered  or when an identifiable portion of the contract is completed  no significant post delivery obligations exist and collection of the resulting receivable is considered reasonably assured 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our historical consumption and our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
in addition  our industry is characterized by technological change  new product development  and product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
our estimates of future product demand may differ from actual results  in which case we may adjust the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we had in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our customers could have an adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets  such as fixed assets  goodwill  intangible assets and investments  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value 
the measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long termed assets 
factors that may affect future results because of the variety of factors and uncertainties affecting our operating results  past financial performance and historical trends may not be a reliable indicator of future performance 
these factors  as well as other factors affecting our operating performance  may result in significant volatility in our common stock price 
among the factors which could affect our future business  financial condition or operating results are the following our operating results may fluctuate we have experienced fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results and anticipate that these fluctuations will continue 
these fluctuations are caused by a number of factors  including the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in complementary third party products with which our products are sold  the mix of products sold and the timing of operating expenditures 
our operating results are also negatively impacted by generally adverse economic conditions throughout the high technology sector 
in particular  our pressure products continue to experience low sales volume due to the recent market conditions in the semiconductor industry 
the seasonality inherent in our business could cause our operating results to fluctuate the industrial manufacturing equipment industry in which we compete has historically been subject to seasonality 
this is also true with respect to european markets in which we compete where business activity declines due to vacations taken in the summer months 
this seasonality  combined with other factors such as the variability in our operating results described above  renders quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations unreliable as indicia of our overall performance 
the market for our products is highly competitive the market for industrial sensors is highly competitive 
many competitors have substantially greater name recognition and technical  marketing and financial resources than we have 
competitive pressures could reduce market acceptance of our products and result in price reductions  decreased revenues and increases in expenses 
our business could suffer if we do not respond to technological change and new product development demands of our customers the market for our products is characterized by changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and new product introductions 
our future success will depend on our ability to respond to emerging industry standards  enhance current products  develop new products  and achieve market acceptance of those products  all on a timely and cost effective basis 
the introduction of new products also requires that we manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption of customer orders  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demands 
our sales are dependent on independent distributors 
a majority of our sales are through third party distributors  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers 
these resellers are not required to offer our products exclusively 
we cannot assure you that a reseller will continue to offer our products 
in addition many of our resellers are privately owned firms which may not be well capitalized  as was demonstrated by the failure of two of our distributors during if our ability to sell products through these third parties is impaired  our results of operations would likely suffer 
our international sales are subject to risks our international sales may be disrupted by currency fluctuations or other events beyond our control  including political or regulatory changes 
if our international sales were disrupted for any reason  our revenue levels would decline 
our business could suffer if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and services 
there can be no assurance that our patents  trademarks  or contractual arrangements or other steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or defer independent third party development of similar technologies 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the technology licenses granted to us from our parent company will continue to be available 
the loss of any of our proprietary technology could require us to obtain technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
also  competitors may develop their own intellectual property or technologies  obtain their own patents  or challenge the validity of  or be able to design around  our patents 
the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products  services or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we may initiate claims or litigation against other third parties for infringement of proprietary rights or to establish the validity of proprietary rights 
similarly  our competitors may initiate claims or litigation against us alleging infringement of their proprietary rights or improper use of their intellectual property 
litigation relating to intellectual property to which we may become a party is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the risk of counterclaims or other litigation against us  and we may not be successful in any such litigation 
our operations have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by uncertain global economic and political conditions our business may suffer as a result of general economic and political conditions in the us and abroad 
in and  there was a rapid and severe downturn in the us market and global economy 
whether that trend will continue is uncertain 
this uncertainty has been compounded by recent terrorist activity  such as the attacks in the us on september   and the recent military activity in afghanistan  iraq and the middle east 
additional terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage or disruption to us or to our suppliers and our customers 
fears of global recession  war  and terrorism may continue to have seriously detrimental effects on the us and global economies 
such conditions could further dampen consumer confidence and cause our customers to slow or cease spending on our products 
if these events continue  our operations may be negatively impacted 
we are dependent upon suppliers and outsourced manufacturing  several of which are located outside of the us disruption of our access to these supplies and services  or problems with the quality of supplies or services  could prevent us from filling customer orders and harm our business 
the principal components of our products are purchased from outside vendors 
we generally buy components under purchase orders  do not have long term agreements with our suppliers  and we generally do not maintain large inventories of components 
any termination of  or significant disruption of  our relationships with the suppliers of our product components may prevent us from filling customer orders in a timely manner which could result in customer dissatisfaction and lost sales 
we rely on third party manufacturers for subassembly of products and for final assembly  quality assurance  and testing of some of our products 
these outsourcing arrangements and any future outsourcing arrangements involve numerous risks  including reduced control over product quality  delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  and costs 
our ability to develop and market our products is dependent upon our retention of certain executive officers and other key personnel 
we are greatly dependent on the ability to retain key management and technical personnel  and our future success is highly dependent upon the personal efforts of our management and technical personnel 
the loss of services of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our success will also be dependent in part upon our ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly skilled employees 
we may need to offer additional compensation or incentives to attract and retain these and other employees 
if we are unable to successfully develop our international sales efforts  our results of operations may suffer 
we have to develop  integrate  and expand our international distribution networks in an effort to increase international sales of our products 
we may not be successful in developing or expanding the international distribution network or in marketing and selling products in foreign markets 
if the revenues generated by our international sales are not adequate to recover the expense of establishing  expanding  and maintaining an international distribution network  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if international sales become a more significant component of net sales  our business could become more vulnerable to the risks inherent in doing business internationally  including difficulties in managing foreign resellers  longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable  the effects of seasonal customer demand  changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in meeting the requirements of different international product regulations  risks relating to intellectual property rights  increased expenses due to efforts to localize our product offerings  export restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and potentially adverse tax consequences and political instability 
the existence or occurrence of any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our investments represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the area of interest rate changes impacting the fair value of our investment securities 
our policy is to invest primarily in money market accounts and short term investments held at financial institutions 
we do not have any derivative instruments in our investment portfolio 
due to their highly liquid nature  our investments are subject to minimal credit and market risk
