item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the preceding selected consolidated financial and operating information 
additionally  our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  as well as other data included in this document  should be read and analyzed in combination with the analysis below 
overview the primary source of the company s revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments  and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed money 
net interest income can change significantly from period to period based on general levels of interest rates  customer prepayment patterns  the mix of interest earning assets and the mix of interest bearing and non interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
the company manages the risk of changes in interest rates on its net interest income through an asset liability committee and through related interest rate risk monitoring and management policies and practices 
in addition  the company generates revenue through fee based services 
many of these services provide additional low cost deposits for  or have other synergies with  the core banking operations 
during  the company sold its wholesale loan origination production platform as discussed in item business discontinued operations 
we sold the platform because we were concerned that  over an extended period of time  we would find it difficult to compete in the highly competitive  lower margin mortgage origination industry  and believe that the synergies provided to our core operations from this line of business were no longer beneficial from an operational risk standpoint 
the company was able to successfully reinvest the liquidity generated by the sale of the production platform without substantially impacting its net interest income 
the historically low interest rates in were a significant challenge to our asset liability committee 
we have maintained our positive net interest gap  which means that our assets are expected to re price quicker than our liabilities as interest rates change 
see a detailed discussion of our strategies to manage our risk in item asset and liability management which follows 
the low interest rate environment in caused continued compression of our net interest income and was the cause of a significant amount of amortization expense on our mortgage servicing rights 
the mortgage servicing rights are amortized based on the expected pattern and life of related servicing revenues and our investment is also evaluated quarterly for impairment 
as interest rates fall  there is a higher probability of prepayment as the borrower can generally refinance the loan 
the historically low mortgage interest rate environment in led to high prepayments and refinancing resulting in continued high levels of servicing rights amortization 
if interest rates remain at current levels or increase in  there should be reduced refinance activity and reduced related amortization  and a possibility of additional recovery on the recorded impairment 
conversely  if interest rates decrease to levels of the summer of  levels of amortization and impairments could be significant 
certain of our fee based business  including the acquisition  brokerage and sale of sba loans and loan pools  fees generated from the management and disposition of foreclosed properties owned by independent financial services companies  and our investment in matrix settlement and clearance services continue to be a strong point in our operations  and in positively impacting our core banking operations 
growth in core deposits continued in  primarily driven by deposits generated by subsidiaries of the company for matrix bank 
we will focus on these businesses and our core banking operations in and beyond 
the following portions of the management s discussion and analysis focus in more detail on the results of operations for  and and on information about the company s balance sheet  credit quality  liquidity and funding resources  capital  critical accounting estimates and other matters 
general matrix bancorp was formed in june when the founding shareholders of matrix financial and united financial  now known as matrix bancorp trading  two of our subsidiaries  exchanged all of their outstanding capital stock for shares of our stock in a series of transactions that were each accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in september  we acquired dona ana savings and loan association  fsb  which was subsequently renamed matrix capital bank 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we formed matrix asset management  formerly united special services  in june and united capital markets in december in february  we acquired the vintage group whose primary subsidiary is sterling trust in a pooling of interests and  accordingly  no goodwill was recorded and our consolidated financial statements for the prior periods were restated 
additionally  we acquired abs in march the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we entered into our joint venture  matrix settlement clearance services  in september of on august   we sold the stock of united capital markets to one of the officers of that company 
on august   matrix financial  our mortgage banking operation  became an operating subsidiary of matrix bank 
on october   first matrix  our broker dealer operation  became an operating subsidiary of matrix bancorp trading 
the principal components of our revenues consist of o net interest income recorded by matrix bank  matrix financial and abs school services  o brokerage and consulting fees generated by matrix bancorp trading and first matrix  o disposition services fees generated by matrix asset management  o gains on sales of mortgage loans generated by matrix bank and matrix financial  o loan administration fees generated by matrix financial  o trust service fees generated by sterling trust and matrix bank  and o school service fees generated by abs 
our results of operations are influenced by changes in interest rates and the effect of these changes on our interest margins  mortgage loan prepayments and the value of mortgage servicing portfolios 
our fee based businesses are effected to a lesser extent by interest rates and more by competition and general market conditions 
discontinued operations sale of wholesale production platform on september   we announced the final closing  and substantial completion of the sale by matrix financial of substantially all of its assets associated with its wholesale mortgage origination platform 
see item business discontinued operations for a more detailed discussion 
we agreed to sell the platform because we were concerned that  over an extended period of time  we would find it difficult to compete in the highly competitive mortgage origination industry that generally operates on high volume and low margins 
based on the size of our wholesale production platform  we were required to commit a significant percentage of our capital to a line of business that is fairly cyclical and the earnings were difficult for us to estimate 
the sale of platform has allowed us to reduce our operational risks and the costs associated with the platform 
we were successful in reinvesting the liquidity created from the sale into predominately adjustable rate loans  sba loans and high quality mortgage backed securities  thereby reducing the financial impact of being underinvested due to the sale of the production platform 
the operations of the production platform  which reflect income from discontinued operations  net of tax effect  of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements  and will be presented as such in future releases and filings  and as such are not included in the discussion of results from continuing operations below 
it should be noted the discontinued operations are based upon the company s historical results from operations of the production platform  adjusted to reflect the impact of the sale of the production platform 
because there was an opportunity cost of owning the production platform  the historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that might have occurred if the disposition had actually been completed on the indicated date  and are not indicative of any future results 
comparison of results of operations for fiscal years and loss from continuing operations 
a loss of million for the fiscal year was recognized  an improvement of million to the loss of million for fiscal year on a basic and diluted per share basis  loss was for the fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year our loss in was primarily caused by the incurrence of million of amortization of our mortgage servicing asset  which increased million from levels 
this increase was due to an increase in the prepayment speeds on the loans underlying the mortgage servicing asset caused by the historical low interest rate environment 
the impact of the increased amortization was offset by a recovery of million of impairment charges recorded against our mortgage servicing rights asset  whereas in there was a million  net pre tax  impairment charge against the value of the mortgage servicing rights 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan and valuation losses decreased million to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year our net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   and interest rate spread decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest margin and the interest rate spread is due to a combination of a basis point decrease in the average rate earned on average interest earning assets to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the effects of the decrease in rates on interest earning assets was offset partially by a decrease in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities of basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  both the decrease in the rate earned on our average interest earning assets  and the decrease in the cost of our average interest bearing liabilities is driven by continued low levels of market interest rates prevalent throughout the impact of the low interest rate environment is not as direct for the average interest bearing liabilities as certain of the term borrowings are at fixed rates

provision for loan and valuation losses 
the provision for loan and valuation losses increased thousand  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase was attributable to increased levels of reserves as a result of an increase in our homogeneous residential loan portfolio acquired to replace the originated wholesale loans  which liquidity was available due to the sale of the production platform as discussed in item business discontinued operations 
the company s historic experience is that our homogeneous residential loan portfolio has slightly greater losses than mortgage loans that are sold within days of origination

loan administration fees decreased million to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year loan service fees are affected by factors that include the size of our residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio  the servicing spread  the timing of payment collections and the amount of ancillary fees received 
our mortgage loan servicing portfolio decreased to an average balance of billion for fiscal year as compared to an average balance of billion for fiscal year the impact of the decrease in the average balance of the servicing portfolio was partially offset by an increase in the average service fee including all ancillary income to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  matrix financial anticipates loan administration fees to continue to decrease as its servicing portfolio decreases through normal prepayments 
brokerage fees 
brokerage fees represent income earned from brokerage and consulting services performed pertaining to mortgage servicing rights  as well as brokerage income earned from whole loan and retail activities  and sba trading fees 
brokerage fees increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase was primarily the result of strong performance and the revenues generated from the acquisition  pooling and selling of sba loans and securities  which increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  trust services 
trust service fees increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase is due to an increase in total trust accounts under administration of  accounts at december  from  accounts at december   and total fiduciary assets under administration which increased to billion at december  from billion at december  the growth was due to increases at matrix bank s trust department  driven by the business referred to us by matrix settlement clearance services

gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights 
gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights decreased to for fiscal year from thousand for fiscal year due to the low interest rate environment prevalent in the second half of and all of  the market conditions were not favorable for our servicing portfolio 
if interest rates increase and prices become more attractive  we may sell a portion of our servicing asset 
gains from the sale of mortgage servicing rights can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on the market value of our servicing portfolio  the particular servicing portfolios we elect to sell and the availability of similar portfolios in the market 
school services 
school services income represents fees earned by abs  operating as the geo group  for outsourced business and consulting services provided primarily to charter schools 
school services income decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of  and rates paid by our core business service clients  as a result of the strategic decision in mid to downsize the level of capital committed to abs  and to reduce our operating exposure in this line of business

noninterest expense decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to a million non cash impariment charge on mortgage servicing rights incurred in as compared to a million recovery of such impairment in fiscal this decrease was also due to a million charge to write off the goodwill balance at abs incurred in  whereas a similar charge was not incurred in fiscal the decrease was offset by an increase in the level of amortization on our mortgage servicing rights asset 
the following table details the major components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands compensation and employee benefits   amortization of mortgage servicing rights   occupancy and equipment   postage and communication   professional fees   data processing   recovery of impairment on mortgage servicing rights   other general and administrative   total   compensation and employee benefits decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this decrease was primarily the result of decreased salaries and wages associated with reductions in the overall number of employees  primarily at abs  and by decreases in medical benefits expense associated with the structural rate changes implemented for the benefit year 
the company had an overall decrease of employees  or  to employees at december  as compared to employees at december  amortization of mortgage servicing rights increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year amortization of mortgage servicing rights fluctuates based on the size of our mortgage servicing portfolio and the prepayment rates experienced with respect to the underlying mortgage loan portfolio 
in response to the continued historic low interest rates prevalent in the market  prepayment speeds on our servicing portfolio continued to increase to an average of during fiscal year as compared to during fiscal year  which increase offset the effects of a decrease in the average balance of our mortgage servicing rights to million for the fiscal year as compared to million for the fiscal year 
recovery of impairment on mortgage servicing rights  which is a non cash item  reflects a recovery for the year ended december  of million as compared to an impairment charge of million for the year ended december  the company is required to record its investment in mortgage servicing rights at the lower of cost or fair value 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined based on the discounted future servicing income stratified based on one or more predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
the company stratifies its mortgage servicing rights by product type and investor to reflect the predominant risks 
to determine the fair value of its investment  the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of future cash flows 
due to increases in interest rates in  a portion of the previously recorded impairment was recovered increasing the carrying basis to fair value 
it is not possible to estimate if future recoveries will occur  and further decreases in market interest rates  or increases in anticipated future prepayment speeds  may cause additional impairment charges in future periods 
the remainder of noninterest expense  which includes occupancy and equipment expense  postage and communication  professional fees  data processing costs and other expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase is primarily related to increased levels of subaccounting fees paid by matrix bank  increased consulting fees  consisting of accounting  auditing  information services  legal and other  incurred at matrix bank  matrix financial and matrix tower holdings in fiscal year above those from fiscal year  litigation settlement costs in fiscal year at matrix financial that were not present in fiscal year  writedown of real estate owned at abs in  and losses realized on loans repurchased at matrix financial related to the production platform in that were not present in income taxes

the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined based on the discounted future servicing income stratified based on one or more predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
the company stratifies its mortgage servicing rights by product type and investor to reflect the predominant risks 
to determine the fair value of its investment  the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of future cash flows 
due to the drop in interest rates  both the actual and anticipated prepayment speeds used in the valuation model increased causing the fair value of the servicing to decrease below the carrying basis which resulted in an impairment 
the majority of the impairment related to the servicing rights retained by the company on its originations over the last year 
the remainder of noninterest expense  which includes occupancy and equipment expense  postage and communication expense  professional fees  data processing costs and other expenses  increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase is primarily related to the charges and reserves noted above  as well as increases in foreclosure expenses at matrix financial  miscellaneous operation expenses associated with additional volume at matrix bank  first matrix and matrix asset management  and incremental reserves and write offs of receivables primarily at abs

      change in net interest income before provision for loan and valuation losses       asset and liability management general 
a significant portion of our revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  we strive to manage our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate what we believe to be an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of our performance due to changes in interest rates 
we constantly attempt to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
we have responded to interest rate volatility by developing and implementing asset and liability management strategies designed to increase noninterest income and improve the match between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these strategies include o increasing focus on lines of business that are less interest rate sensitive  such as brokerage activities  consulting services  self directed trust services  clearing operations and real estate disposition  o purchasing adjustable rate mortgages  o increasing emphasis on the origination of construction  multi family and commercial real estate lending  including sba loans  which tend to have higher interest rates with shorter loan maturities than residential mortgage loans and generally are at adjustable rates  o acquisition and sales of guaranteed portions of sba loans  which are generally at adjustable rates  o extending the maturity of our interest bearing liabilities by borrowing longer term advances from the fhlbank  o pursuing institutional alliances or depository relationships that provide fee based income or generate liabilities that are less expensive or less interest rate sensitive than retail deposits or borrowings from third party institutions to fund our investing activities  o focusing on noninterest bearing custodial escrow balances related to our mortgage servicing rights  o hedging segments of our servicing portfolio  o using matrix bank as the settlement bank for settlement and clearing services offered by sterling trust and matrix settlement clearance services to generate low cost deposits  and o expanding our trust activities to provide custodial services to matrix settlement clearance services clients to increase fee income and low cost deposits 
the strategies outlined have been adhered to over the past several years 
as a result of the strategies  matrix bank is positively gapped  which means that its assets will re price quicker than its liabilities as interest rates fluctuate 
as a result  if interest rates increase  the rising interest rates should have a positive impact on the net interest income 
however  if interest rates remain static or decrease further  we should experience some compression in our net interest income as certain of our interest bearing and noninterest bearing liabilities cannot re price any lower 
due to the historic low interest rate environment  our investment in mortgage servicing rights was very unprofitable in and in the current interest rate environment  the investment in mortgage servicing rights will cause the amortization of the investment to remain at higher levels that initially estimated 
due to the sale of the production platform  as discussed in item business discontinued operations  we do not anticipate increasing our investment in mortgage servicing rights 
we also face the challenge of managing the servicing costs of our servicing operation as our investment continues to decrease  as many of the costs are fixed 
the increased cost in relation to the level of investment may cause the investment to be even less profitable 
we may consider several options related to the servicing operations  including the reduction of expenses  the potential sale of the operations  and strategic sales of the servicing asset 
during the first quarter of  as dicussed in item business sale of matrix capital bank branches  we announced the potential sale of our two retail branch locations in las cruces  new mexico 
included in the sale are approximately million of retail deposits  representing less than of our interest bearing liabilities  and approximately million of loans originated in the las cruces market 
the decision to sell the locations will allow us to focus our efforts on generating institutional depository alliances which we believe is a less expensive funding strategy 
lending activities 
our major interest earning asset is our loan portfolio 
consequently  a significant part of our asset and liability management involves monitoring the composition of our loan portfolio  including the corresponding maturities 
the following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio by loan type as of the dates indicated 
the amounts in the table below are shown net of discounts and other deductions 
as of december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands residential      multi family  commercial real estate and      commercial school financing      construction      consumer      total loans      less allowance for loan and valuation losses      loans receivable  net 
     the following table presents the aggregate maturities of loans in each major category of our loan portfolio as of december   excluding the allowance for loan losses 
loans held for sale are classified as maturing over five years 
actual maturities may differ from the maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments or the timing of loan sales 
as of december  less than one to over five one year five years years total in thousands residential     multi family  commercial real estate and commercial     school financing    construction     consumer    total loans     loans held for sale  excluding the allowance for loan losses  which are primarily contractually due in less than one to five years  are split between fixed and adjustable rates as follows as of december  less than one to over five one year five years years total in thousands fixed    adjustable    total loans    loans held for investment  excluding the allowance for loan losses  which are contractually due in one or more years  are split between fixed and adjustable rates as follows as of december  less than one to over five one year five years years total in thousands fixed     adjustable     total loans     nonperforming assets 
as part of asset and liability management  we monitor nonperforming assets on a monthly basis 
nonperforming assets consist primarily of nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate 
loans are placed on nonaccrual when full payment of principal or interest is in doubt or when they are past due days as to either principal or interest 
foreclosed real estate arises primarily through foreclosure on mortgage loans owned 
the following table sets forth our nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated as of december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual residential mortgage loans      nonaccrual commercial real estate  commercial loans      and school financing nonaccrual consumer loans total nonperforming loans      foreclosed real estate     total nonperforming assets      total nonperforming loans to total loans total nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of allowance for loan and valuation losses to total nonperforming loans interest on nonperforming loans not included in interest income    we accrue for interest on government sponsored loans such as fha insured and va guaranteed loans which are past due or more days  as the majority of the interest on these loans is insured by the federal government 
the aggregate unpaid principal balance of government sponsored accruing loans that were past due or more days was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
nonaccrual residential mortgage loans as a percentage of total loans were at december   at december   at december   at december  and at december the nonaccrual residential mortgage loans have increased at december  as compared to december  the increase is due to residential portfolios added at matrix financial in the latter part of the increase at matrix financial is related to our origination activity prior to the sale of the production platform in february  as discussed in item business discontinued operations 
the nonaccrual loans relate to loans that have been repurchased from investors for a breach of a representation or warranty primarily consisting of not obtaining mortgage insurance from the fha 
we do not anticipate an increase in because we have ceased our origination activities 
the decrease in nonaccrual commercial loans and school financing in is primarily attributable to the decreased amount of commercial real estate and construction loans in nonaccrual status  which decreased million to thousand at december  in addition  there were decreases in the balance of sba originated and purchased loans in nonaccrual status  which decreased million to million at december  it should be noted that approximately million of the interest and principal of these loans is guaranteed  and as such  our credit risk is minimized by those guarantees 
with regard to our school financing  a majority of our past origination of tax exempt financing for charter schools is for the purchase of real estate and equipment 
the balance of these loans in nonaccrual status decreased million to million at december  the decrease is due to our success at working with the schools to either become current on their loans or to have their loans refinanced with unaffiliated institutions  which results in the pay off of the balances outstanding with us 
not included in the balance is thousand of delinquent school financing that was sold to a third party with recourse 
the losses related to the delinquencies and foreclosures would be recorded as part of noninterest expense 
the prior delinquency and anticipated future delinquencies are taken into consideration in the pricing of the loans acquired 
at december   million  or  of the nonaccrual loans were loans that were residential loans purchased in bulk loan portfolios and remain classified as held for sale 
total loans held for sale at december   were billion  of which million  or  were in nonaccrual status 
analysis of allowance for loan and valuation losses 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in our allowance for loan and valuation losses for the periods indicated 
the table includes the allowance for both loans held for investment and loans held for sale 
as of and for the year ended december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan and valuation losses  beginning of year      charge offs real estate mortgage   real estate construction commercial loans and school financing   consumer total charge offs     recoveries real estate mortgage commercial loans and school financing consumer total recoveries net charge offs     provision for loan and valuation losses charged to operations      balance at end of year      ratio of net charge offs to average loans average loans outstanding during the year      the allowance for loan and valuation losses is analyzed by management as discussed below and is increased by the provision for loan and valuation losses  which is charged to operations  as necessary 
the allowance for loan and valuation losses is calculated  in part  based on historical loss experience 
in addition  management takes into consideration other factors  such as o qualitative evaluations of individual classified assets  o geographic and other portfolio concentrations  o new products or markets  o evaluations of the changes in the historical loss experience component  and o projections of this component into the current and future periods based on current knowledge and conditions 
these loss factors range from for fha va loans guaranteed by the hud  to for unsecured credit card loans 
the loss factors are applied to the outstanding principal balance of loans in their respective categories 
loans in the commercial and school finance portfolios are assigned loss factors based on items similar to those listed  plus additional individual loan review on all significant loans  including sba loans  which result in loans being classified as watch  substandard or doubtful 
the company considers a loan impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
accordingly  potential impaired loans of the company include only commercial loans  real estate construction loans  commercial real estate mortgage loans and school financing 
impairment allowances are considered by the company in determining the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
after an allowance has been established for the loan portfolio  management establishes a portion of the allowance for loan losses  which is attributed to factors that cannot be associated with a specific loan or loan portfolio 
the company evaluates its residential loans collectively due to their homogeneous nature 
these factors include o general economic conditions  o recognition of specific regional geographic concerns  o loan type and the assessed risk inherent in each loan category  and o trends in the portfolio and portfolio growth trends 
substandard and doubtful loans of homogeneous loan portfolios are assigned loss factors of to 
the loss factors are applied to the outstanding principal balances of loans in their respective categories 
the total for all categories as described above determines our allowance for loan and valuation losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when the probability of collection is considered remote 
the following table shows information regarding the components of our allowance for loan and valuation losses as of the dates indicated as of december  percentage percentage percentage percentage percentage of loans of loans of loans of loans of loans in each in each in each in each in each category category category category category amount to amount to amount to amount to amount to total total total total total loans loans loans loans loans dollars in thousands residential      multi family  commercial real estate and commercial     school financing      construction consumer the ratio of the allowance for loan and valuation losses to total loans was at december   at december   at december  at december  and at december  the allowance for loan and valuation losses is reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the balance of the allowance for loan and valuation losses allocated to residential has increased  due to the increase in these loans in nonaccrual status  while the balance of loan and valuation losses allocated to multi family  commercial real estate  commercial  school financing and construction loans has decreased mainly due to the decreased outstanding loan principal balances in these loan categories 
as of december   we believe that the allowance  when taken as a whole  is adequate to absorb losses in the current loan portfolio 
risk sensitive assets and liabilities 
as discussed in asset and liability management general a significant portion of our operations and ultimate success is partially dependent upon our ability to manage our interest rate risk 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
although we manage other risks  such as credit  operational and liquidity risk in the normal course of business  we consider interest rate risk to be a significant market risk which could potentially have the largest material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the majority of our market risk related to interest rates exists within the operations of matrix bank 
however  matrix financial also has interest rate risk related to its primary asset  mortgage servicing rights 
the susceptibility to movements in interest rates affects the cash flows generated from the mortgage servicing rights  which are recorded in other income versus interest income 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the underlying servicing portfolio tends to prepay faster  which reduces future servicing income  in an increasing interest rate environment  prepayments tend to decrease  which increases expected future servicing income 
we currently do not maintain a trading portfolio 
as a result  we are not exposed to market risk as it relates to trading activities 
the majority of our residential loan portfolio is held for sale  which requires us to perform quarterly market valuations of the portfolio in order to properly record the portfolio at the lower of aggregate cost or market 
therefore  we continually monitor the interest rates of our loan portfolio as compared to prevalent interest rates in the market 
interest rate risk management at matrix bank is the responsibility of the asset and liability committee  which reports to the board of directors of matrix bank 
the asset and liability committee establishes policies that monitor and coordinate our sources  uses and pricing of funds 
the asset and liability committee is also involved in formulating our budget and strategic plan as it relates to investment objectives 
we have engaged a third party to provide consulting services to assist us with our asset liability management 
we meet with this consulting firm quarterly to monitor the interest rate risk position and to analyze and discuss strategies related to asset liability management 
in  we purchased the software from our third party consultant to be able to internally model asset liability and interest rate risk positions and alternatives as requested by the asset and liability committee 
we anticipate that we will continue to engage this consulting firm on a quarterly basis to perform quarter end models of interest rate risk and asset liability positions and will use our internal modeling to support asset liability decisions between quarter end 
part of the modeling is done to comply with the requirements of the ots 
we continue to attempt to reduce the volatility in net interest income by managing the relationship of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities 
to accomplish this  we focus on acquiring adjustable rate residential mortgages and have increased our efforts regarding the origination of residential construction loans  multi family loans  commercial real estate loans  sba loans and limited consumer lending  which re price or mature more quickly than fixed rate residential real estate loans 
in the fourth quarter of  we began a strategy of purchasing with the intent to sell the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
again  the loans generally adjust with prime and present very little interest rate risk 
the risk associated with the guaranteed sba loans acquired resides with the significant premium paid for the loans 
the other significant asset that in the past we have invested in is residential mortgage servicing rights 
the value and cash flows from residential mortgage servicing rights respond counter cyclically to the value of fixed rate mortgages 
when interest rates increase and the value of fixed rate mortgages decrease  in turn decreasing net interest income  the value of the mortgage servicing rights increase 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the inverse occurs 
it is important to note  however  that an equal increase or decrease in interest rates will not affect the value of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio equally 
a decrease in interest rates causes a greater reduction in the value of the portfolio as compared to the increase in value in the portfolio from an equal increase in interest rates 
the scenario discussed of decreasing interest rates is exactly what happened in and the interest rate environment in remained at historically low levels 
in response to the low interest rates  we experienced significant runoff in our servicing portfolio 
due to the volatility of the value of mortgage servicing  we do not anticipate increasing our investment in to the contrary  we expect our overall investment in to again decrease through normal runoff 
ownership of mortgage servicing rights exposes us to impairment of their value in certain interest rate environments 
the incidence of prepayment of a mortgage loan increases during periods of declining interest rates as the homeowner seeks to refinance the loan to a lower interest rate 
if the level of prepayment on segments of our mortgage servicing portfolio achieves a level higher than we projected for an extended period of time  then an impairment in the associated basis in the mortgage servicing rights may occur 
to mitigate this risk of impairment due to declining interest rates  we initiated a hedging program on a portion of our investment 
during prior to the sale of the production platform as discussed in item business discontinued operations  we sold substantially all of our newly originated servicing rights with the intent of reducing our overall investment in mortgage servicing rights 
we expect in to attempt to sell portions of our mortgage servicing portfolio as the opportunity presents itself  and continue to reduce our overall investment in this asset 
another significant strategy that we focus on in managing interest rate risk is identifying lines of business that generate noninterest rate sensitive liabilities 
examples of this strategy are the investment in mortgage servicing rights  which generate no cost escrow deposits  sterling trust s operations  which administer deposits with relatively low costs  and our investment in matrix settlement clearance services that uses  or its clients use  matrix bank as the clearing bank and custodian  which creates low cost deposits 
with regards to our interest sensitive liabilities  in order to take advantage of the declining and low interest rate environment present in and  and to extend the average lives of our interest bearing liabilities  matrix bank entered into short option agreements and other longer term advances to years totaling million  which have interest rates ranging from to 
it is anticipated that our interest margin will benefit in the long term as interest rates increase 
short term borrowings 
a primary function of asset and liability management is to ensure adequate liquidity 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  we rely heavily on short term borrowing capabilities for liquidity and as a funding vehicle 
the primary sources for short term borrowings are the fhlbank for matrix bank  third party credit facility for abs  and the revolving portion of the bank stock loan for matrix bancorp 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the following table sets forth a summary of our short term borrowings during  and and as of the end of each such period average amount amount maximum weighted weighted outstanding outstanding outstanding average average at during the at any interest interest year end year month end rate during rate at the year year end dollars in thousands at or for the year ended december  fhlbank borrowings    revolving lines of credit   school financing    at or for the year ended december  fhlbank borrowings    revolving lines of credit    school financing    at or for the year ended december  fhlbank borrowings    revolving lines of credit    school financing    calculations are based on daily averages where available and monthly averages otherwise 
a total of million of the fhlbank borrowings outstanding at december  were borrowed under short option advance agreements with the fhlbank 
the interest rates on the short option advance borrowings ranged from to at december  and their possible call dates varied from january to november additionally  million of the fhlbank borrowings outstanding at december  are fixed term rate advances  which were borrowed from the fhlbank to offset specific loans originated by matrix bank 
the principal amount of these fixed term rate advances adjust monthly based on an amortization schedule 
the interest rate on the fixed term rate advances was  and their maturity date is june a total of million of the fhlbank borrowings outstanding at december  were borrowed under short option advance agreement with the fhlbank

the principal amount of these fixed term rate advances adjust monthly based on an amortization schedule 
the interest rate on the fixed term rate advances was  and their maturity date is june liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate funds to support asset growth  satisfy disbursement needs  maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis 
to date  our principal source of funding for our investing activities has been o secured senior debt provided by unaffiliated financial institutions  o the issuance of junior subordinated debentures through matrix bancorp capital trust i in  matrix bancorp capital trust ii  iii and iv in and matrix bancorp capital trust v in  o the issuance of subordinated debt offering in february  o the issuance of senior notes in september  o a bank stock loan  and o our initial public offering 
as of december   matrix bancorp had million in indebtedness outstanding 
the borrowed funds have been used historically as capital injections to matrix bank  matrix financial  matrix bancorp trading and abs 
on march   matrix bancorp amended its bank stock loan agreement 
the amended bank stock loan agreement has two components  an million term loan and a revolving line of credit of million 
as of december   the balance of the term loan was million and the balance of the revolving line of credit was the amended bank stock loan requires matrix bancorp to maintain total shareholders equity of million 
matrix bank is required to maintain classified assets of less than of total assets from january  to and including march   and of total assets thereafter  and must also earn in excess of million over the previous four quarters as of the end of each fiscal quarter from june  forward 
the covenants must be met quarterly 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
the term loan has a maturity date of december  the revolving line of credit is annually renewed and currently has a maturity date of march  we are in the process of renewing the revolving line of credit and are in negotiations regarding extending the maturity date of the term loan 
however  there can be no assurances that the bank stock loan will be renewed or any terms modified 
the company has sponsored five trusts  matrix bancorp capital trusts i through v  of which of the common equity is owned by the company 
the trusts were formed for the purposes of issuing corporation obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities the capital securities to third party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of such capital securities solely in junior subordinated debt securities of the company 
the debentures held by each trust are the sole assets of that trust 
distributions on the capital securities issued by each trust are payable either quarterly or semiannually at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate being earned by the trust on the debentures held by that trust 
the capital securities are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment o the debentures 
the company has entered into agreements which  taken collectively  fully and unconditionally guarantee the capital securities subject to the term of each of the guarantees 
see details and further discussion of these trusts included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the company issued million of subordinated debt with a ten year maturity 
the interest rate adjusts quarterly based on the day libor at a margin of 
interest payments are to be made quarterly 
generally  the debt covenants are no less restrictive than the capital trusts discussed below 
the net proceeds will be used to satisfy the full repayment of the senior notes discussed in the following paragraph in september on september   we completed a registered debt offering of million in senior notes due in september  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
interest on the senior notes of is payable semi annually on march and september of each year 
the senior notes require us to o maintain consolidated tangible equity capital of not less than million  and o meet the requirements necessary such that matrix bank will not be classified as other than well capitalized as defined by applicable regulatory guidelines 
additionally  the senior notes contain other covenants regarding certain restricted payments  incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock  liens  merger  consolidation or sale of assets and transactions with affiliates 
as of december   due to repurchases made by the company of the senior notes  there remained million of the debt issue outstanding 
through issuances of the subordinated debt in february  we should have adequate liquidity and intend to payoff the balance of the senior notes in matrix bancorp has guaranteed the indebtedness of matrix settlement clearance services to us bank  us  in an amount not greater than million 
the guaranty relates to a million line of credit with a third party that is utilized by matrix settlement clearance services in situations where its clients do not wire funds to settle trades 
if the guaranty is utilized  our joint venture partner guarantees half of any such obligation 
the line is used very infrequently and matrix settlement clearance services is adequately secured in the case that the utilization of the line is required 
there was outstanding at matrix settlement clearance services on such indebtedness at december  the trend of net cash used by our operating activities experienced over the reported periods results primarily from the growth at matrix bank  matrix asset management and first matrix 
we anticipate that in  this trend should in part reverse as any further growth at matrix bank and first matrix will be funded through additional revenues at those companies  however  as the growth initiatives at matrix asset management are still in the early stages for certain of their new initiatives  cash will be required to fund this growth 
the company is reliant on dividend and tax payments from its subsidiaries in order to fund operations  meet debt obligations and grow new or developing lines of business 
a long term inability of a subsidiary to make dividend payments could significantly impact the company s liquidity 
historically  the majority of the dividend payments have been made by matrix bank and its consolidated subsidiaries  which include matrix financial 
due to the success experienced by matrix bancorp trading and matrix asset management in  dividends were also paid by these subsidiaries to the company 
the current dividend policy approved by matrix bank is of the consolidated cumulative earnings of matrix bank 
matrix bank made dividend payments in  for earnings through april   and is anticipating payment of the remaining calculated dividends for in the current dividend policy approved by matrix bancorp trading and matrix asset management is of the earnings of those subsidiaries 
absent these dividend payments  the company intends to utilize the line of credit on its bank stock loan  as needed  to meet its own and the other subsidiaries financial obligations 
additionally  it is anticipated that during  a portion of the capital that was committed to abs will be returned through dividends to matrix bancorp as the loans receivable at abs are liquidated under a strategy adopted in the timing and amounts of this liquidation are fluid  but are anticipated to provide liquidity to the company during matrix bank s primary source of funds for use in lending  purchasing bulk loan portfolios  investing and other general purposes are o trust deposits  o custodial escrow balances  o brokered deposits  o fhlbank borrowings  o retail and wholesale deposits  o sales of loan portfolios  and o proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans 
contractual loan payments and net deposit inflows are a generally predictable source of funds  while loan prepayments and loan sales are significantly influenced by general market interest rates and economic conditions 
borrowings on a short term basis are used as a cash management vehicle to compensate for seasonal or other reductions in normal sources of funds 
matrix bank utilizes advances from the fhlbank as its primary source for borrowings 
at december   matrix bank had overnight and term borrowings from the fhlbank of million 
the availability of fhlbank borrowings is based on the level of collateral pledged 
generally  the availability will be limited based on eligible collateral pledged or of total assets 
the custodial escrow balances held by matrix bank fluctuate based upon the mix and size of the related mortgage servicing rights portfolios and the timing of payments for taxes and insurance  as well as the level of prepayments which occurs 
for a tabular presentation of the our short term borrowings  see asset and liability management short term borrowings 
matrix bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms 
matrix bank s retail deposits principally consist of demand deposits and certificates of deposit 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in prevailing interest rates and competition 
matrix bank s retail deposits are obtained from areas in which it is located  currently concentrated primarily in las cruces and sun city  with lesser amounts in denver 
matrix bank relies principally on customer service  marketing programs and its relationships with customers to attract and retain in market deposits 
as discussed in in item business sale of matrix bank branches  in february  matrix bank announced the potential sale of its two retail branch locations in las cruces 
included in the sale is approximately million of retail deposits  less than of our interest bearing liabilities 
the sale of the branches is not expected to have a significant impact on the liquidity at matrix bank 
other funding sources discussed will be utilized to replace the deposits 
brokered deposits are accepted and have been utilized to support growth at matrix bank 
in pricing deposit rates  management considers profitability  the matching of term lengths with assets  the attractiveness to customers and rates offered by competitors 
matrix bank intends to continue its efforts to attract deposits as a primary source of funds to support its lending and investing activities

historically  matrix bank has increased its core capital through the retention of a portion of its earnings 
matrix bank s future growth is dependent upon retention of a portion of its earnings and will be funded through wholesale deposit growth  brokered deposits  borrowings from the fhlbank and custodial deposits directed by affiliates 
abs school services principal source of funding for school financing consists of its internal capital  sales of loans to a third party institution and partnership trusts with unaffiliated financial institutions 
amounts available to be sold and amounts to be financed are at the purchaser s and lender s sole discretion 
we continue to pursue additional third party financing and sale options for abs 
we do not anticipate significantly increasing our current loan portfolio 
the company has placed tax exempt financing of approximately million at december  it originated to charter schools into two grantor trusts 
the trusts then issued class a certificates and class b certificates  with the class a certificates being sold to various third party investors under a private placement at a price of par 
the a certificates under the two grantor trusts are guaranteed by a letter of credit issued by a unaffiliated financial institution for one  and the second one is guaranteed equally by two unaffiliated financial institutions 
the first trust s letter of credit arrangement  which currently holds approximately million of tax exempt financing  is scheduled to mature september the second trust s letter of credit arrangement  which currently holds approximately million of tax exempt financing  is scheduled to mature september without the letters of credit  abs will be required to fund the tax exempt financings 
we are in the process of attempting to refinance several of the financings with third party lenders 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful  we will attempt to extend the letter of credit arrangements or seek other borrowing options 
the a certificates interest rate may be determined weekly  monthly or for a term of up to one year 
the interest rate and the term of the interest rate are determined by the remarking agent  which is also the investment bank 
generally  the trusts are short term in nature with an average life of one year or less 
the b certificates are owned by the company 
the interest rate paid on the a certificates is considered the company s financing cost 
the approximate cost of the financing at december  and was and  respectively 
the interest that the company receives through its part ownership of the b certificates is tax exempt 
although a certificates are guaranteed by unaffiliated entities  the company is obligated on a full recourse basis to the unaffiliated entities in all cases of loss or default 
due to the nature of the recourse and the ability of the a certificate holders to put the certificates to the trusts  the transactions have been accounted for as a secured financing 
in addition  under a purchase and sale agreement  abs has sold school financings to an unaffiliated financial institution 
the school financings were sold with full recourse to abs 
abs services the school financings on a scheduled scheduled remittance and in the case of a loss or default  upon the liquidation of the underlying collateral  abs is required to reimburse for any shortfall 
due to the control that the unaffiliated financial institution has over the school financing  the transaction was accounted for as a sale 
the recourse provisions were considered by us at the time of the sale 
no gain or loss was booked at the sale date 
the total balance of the school financings sold with recourse was million at december  matrix bank and sterling trust are restricted in certain instances from paying dividends to matrix bancorp due to certain regulatory requirements 
see item business regulation and supervision 
as discussed in item legal proceedings  we are from time to time party to various litigation matters  in most cases  involving ordinary routine claims incidental to our business 
we accrue for contingent liabilities with respect to litigation matters in accordance with the requirements of sfas  which generally requires the company to accrue a loss for a litigation matter involving a contingent liability if the loss is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
with respect to all pending litigation matters  our ultimate legal and financial responsibility  if any  cannot be estimated with certainty 
as such  the impact on our liquidity and capital cannot be estimated with certainty  and  an adverse decision in certain matters  as described in item legal proceedings  may have a material  adverse impact on our consolidated liquidity or capital 
with regard to the adderley case at sterling trust discussed in item legal proceedings  it was noted that the court of appeals for the second district of texas fort worth affirmed a portion of the jury s award for the plaintiffs and against sterling trust for actual damages of million  plus post judgment interest and conditional attorneys fees for the appeals 
we also noted that we are appealing this decision to the supreme court of texas  but noted that there are no assurances that the supreme court of texas will agree to hear the case  or that  if heard  sterling trust s appeal will be successful 
if we are unsuccessful in this appeal  and if we elect to contribute the capital to sterling trust to pay the judgment  there would be a significant impact on the liquidity of the company 
during the fourth quarter of  the company executed a shareholder rights plan at which time the board of directors of the company declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of the company s common stock 
each of these rights  which are not immediately exercisable  entitles the holder to purchase one one thousandth of a share of the company s newly designated series a junior participating preferred stock at an exercise price of 
the rights are not exercisable until certain events occur  are not detachable from the company s common stock and do not have any immediate value to stockholders 
the rights distribution was made on november   payable to shareholders of record on that date 
the rights will expire on november  inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as prices of goods and services 
critical accounting policies the company and its subsidiaries have established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation and presentation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the company are described in note of the consolidated financial statements  and along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are value in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which management considers to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
the company currently views the determination of the allowance for loan and valuation losses as a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolios  which represent the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
the allowance for loan losses consists of an allocated component and an unallocated component 
the components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimation done pursuant to either sfas  accounting for contingencies  or sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as appropriate 
the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects management s estimate of probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
the company has expanded the geographic footprint in which it operates  and changed its portfolio mix in recent years 
as a result  historical loss experience data used to establish allocation estimates may not precisely correspond to the current portfolio 
uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss 
the historical losses used may not be representative of actual unrealized losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category 
the specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of all loans over a fixed dollar amount where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification 
these analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
the historical loan loss element is generally based on historical loss experience  loss factors are updated as needed based on actual experience 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations and changes in portfolio mix and volume 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
the company also considers the valuation of mortgage servicing rights to be a critical accounting policy that requires judgments  assumptions and estimates concerning impairment of their value in certain interest rate environments 
our mortgage servicing portfolio does not trade in an active open market with readily observable market prices 
although sales of mortgage servicing rights do occur  the exact terms and conditions may not be readily available 
as such  mortgage servicing rights are established and valued in accordance with sfas using discounted cash flow modeling techniques which require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows  taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates  discount rates  servicing costs  and other economic factors 
the expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are the most significant factors driving the value of mortgage servicing rights asset 
increases in mortgage loan prepayments reduce estimated future net servicing cash flows because the life of the underlying loan is reduced 
in determining the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights  mortgage interest rates  which are used to determine prepayment rates  and discount rates are held constant over the estimated life of the portfolio 
expected mortgage loan prepayment rates are derived from a third party model and may be adjusted to reflect the specific characteristics of the company s portfolio 
mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount  net of accumulated amortization  or fair value 
management compares its fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available and to recent market activity and believes that the fair values and related assumptions are comparable to those used by other market participants 
the company has recorded impairment reserves and recoveries of such reserves based on the market conditions and the valuation analysis 
although management believes its process for determining the impairment reserve required adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in declines in value of the mortgage servicing rights  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for impairment could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
the company mitigates risk associated with declines in the estimated fair value of mortgage servicing rights due to increases in mortgage loan prepayments through the use of derivative instruments that are expected to increase in value when interest rates decline 
the company also considers the judgments and assumptions concerning litigation as a critical accounting policy 
the company has been notified that we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings 
most of these cases involve ordinary and routine claims incidental to our business 
we accrue for contingent liabilities with respect to litigation matters in accordance with the requirements of sfas  which generally requires the company to accrue a loss for a litigation matter involving a contingent liability if the loss is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
see a full description of such proceedings at item legal proceedings 
with respect to all pending litigation matters  our ultimate legal responsibility  if any  cannot be estimated with certainty 
based on the ultimate outcome of such proceedings  it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to such proceedings
