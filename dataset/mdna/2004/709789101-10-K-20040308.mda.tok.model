this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  as well as the ratios and statistics  contained elsewhere in this form k 
references will be found in this form k to the following transactions that have impacted or will impact peoples results of operations o as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  peoples completed its acquisition of kentucky bancshares incorporated kentucky bancshares  the holding company of kentucky bank trust  on may  in addition  peoples bank closed an office at ferry street in russell  kentucky  concurrent with this acquisition 
peoples bank also closed its catlettsburg  kentucky  office on october   due to the proximity of the acquired ashland  kentucky  office 
peoples also completed the acquisition of a banking center in malta  ohio  on october   and first colony bancshares  inc first colony  the holding company of the guernsey bank  fsb  on june o in december  peoples bank entered into an agreement to sell its existing credit card portfolio to inficorp holdings  inc inficorp 
preliminary settlement of the sale occurred on december   which resulted in peoples recognizing a pre tax gain  net of expenses  of million  or per diluted share after tax 
final settlement of the sale occurred in the first quarter of  with conversion of the portfolio expected to be completed in the second quarter of peoples bank will continue to serve the credit card needs of its customers through the transition period 
in addition to the sale  peoples bank and inficorp entered into a joint marketing agreement to serve the future credit card needs of peoples customers and prospective customers 
o in december  peoples sold million of mortgage backed investment securities due to the high rate of prepayments on those securities and the corresponding downward pressure on yields from accelerated amortization of bond premiums 
peoples reinvested the proceeds from the sales into other mortgage backed securities that are anticipated to produce a higher yield with estimated lives similar to those of the securities that were sold collectively  the investment portfolio restructuring 
as a result of the sales  peoples recognized a pre tax loss of million  or per share after tax 
approximately million of the reinvestment settled in late december  with the remaining reinvestment of approximately million settling in late january o on december   peoples announced the authorization to repurchase up to  or approximately  of peoples outstanding common shares in from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions stock repurchase program 
the repurchases are eligible to be used for projected exercises of stock options granted under peoples stock option plans  projected purchases of common shares for peoples deferred compensation plans  and other general corporate purposes 
the timing of the purchases and the actual number of common shares purchased are dependent on market conditions and limitations imposed by applicable federal securities laws 
the stock repurchase program expires december   and will not exceed an aggregate purchase price of million 
o on december   peoples prepaid million of long term  convertible rate borrowings from the federal home loan bank fhlb and reborrowed the funds using a short term  repurchase agreement advance collectively  the long term debt restructuring 
the early repayment of the long term borrowings resulted in peoples incurring a pre tax charge of million for prepayment penalties  or cents per share after tax 
the prepaid borrowings had a weighted average rate of and weighted average remaining maturity of years 
the new short term advance has a significantly lower initial interest rate  yet has somewhat similar interest rate sensitivity characteristics in a rising interest rate environment 
o on march   peoples announced the authorization to repurchase up to  or approximately  of peoples then outstanding common shares from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions stock repurchase program 
the common shares repurchased have been  and will be  used for projected exercises of stock options granted under peoples stock option plans  a portion of the consideration to be paid in acquisitions  and other general corporate purposes 
during  peoples repurchased  common shares under the stock repurchase program  which expired on december  o on december   peoples bancorp inc completed the sale of  common shares through a firm commitment underwritten offering and on january   sold an additional  common shares in conjunction with the option granted to the underwriters to cover over allotments collectively  the common stock offering 
the common stock offering generated new capital totaling million after offering expenses 
in january  peoples bancorp used million of the net proceeds to increase peoples bank s capital position 
the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and management of corporate liquidity 
o in december  peoples initiated an investment growth strategy to offset the dilutive impact of the common stock offering  thereby leveraging peoples increased capital levels investment growth strategy 
as a result of this investment growth strategy  total earning assets  particularly mortgage backed investment securities  increased by million in january compared to the year end balance 
peoples funded the investment purchases with million of wholesale market repurchase agreements at an average cost of  million of fhlb advances at an average cost of and million from the common stock offering 
in march  peoples purchased an additional million of mortgage backed investment securities as part of this strategy 
this purchase was primarily funded by an million wholesale market repurchase agreement at a rate of  with the remainder from available corporate funds 
the impact of these transactions  where significant  is discussed in the applicable sections of this management s discussion and analysis 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of peoples conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap and to general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of peoples consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis 
income recognition peoples recognizes interest income by methods conforming to us gaap that include general accounting practices within the financial services industry 
interest income on loans and investment securities is recognized by methods that result in level rates of return on principal amounts outstanding  including yield adjustments resulting from the amortization of loan costs and premiums on investment securities and accretion of loan fees and discounts on investment securities 
since mortgage backed securities comprise a sizable portion of peoples investment portfolio  a significant increase in principal payments on those securities negatively impacts interest income due to the corresponding acceleration of bond premium amortization 
in the event management believes collection of all or a portion of contractual interest on a loan has become doubtful  which generally occurs after the loan is days past due  peoples discontinues the accrual of interest 
in addition  previously accrued interest deemed uncollectible that was recognized in income in the current year is reversed  while amounts recognized in income in the prior year are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only if principal recovery is reasonably assured 
a nonaccrual loan is restored to accrual status when it is brought current or has performed in accordance with contractual terms for a reasonable period of time  and the collectibility of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer doubtful 
allowance for loan losses in general  determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates by management 
peoples maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio based on a quarterly analysis of the portfolio 
this formal analysis determines an appropriate level and allocation of the allowance for loan losses among loan types and resulting provision for loan losses by considering factors affecting loan losses  including specific losses  levels and trends in impaired and nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  current national and local economic conditions  volume  growth and composition of the portfolio  regulatory guidance and other relevant factors 
management continually monitors the loan portfolio through its loan review department and loan loss committee to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance 
the provision expense could increase or decrease each quarter based upon the results of management s formal analysis 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses for the various loan types represents management s estimate of expected losses from existing loans based upon specific allocations for individual lending relationships and historical loss experience for each category of homogeneous loans 
the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation requires management to make estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans  which consists primarily of nonaccrual and restructured loans 
while allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans  the allowance is available for all loan losses 
individual loan reviews are based upon specific quantitative and qualitative criteria  including the size of the loan  loan quality ratings  value of collateral  repayment ability of borrowers  and historical experience factors 
the historical experience factors utilized for individual loan reviews are based upon past loss experience  known trends in losses and delinquencies  the growth of loans in particular markets and industries  and known changes in economic conditions in the particular lending markets 
allowances for homogeneous loans such as residential mortgage loans  credit cards  personal loans  etc 
are evaluated based upon historical loss experience  trends in losses and delinquencies  growth of loans in particular markets  and known changes in economic conditions in each lending market 
consistent with the evaluation of allowances for homogenous loans  allowances relating to the overdraft privilege program are based upon management s monthly analysis of accounts in the program 
this analysis considers factors that could affect future losses on existing accounts  including historical loss experience and length of overdraft 
there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses  but management believes the allowance for loan losses of million at december   was adequate to provide for probable losses from existing loans based on information currently available 
while management uses available information to provide for loan losses  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio  and the need for future additions to the allowance  will be based on changes in economic conditions and other relevant factors 
as such  adverse changes in economic activity could reduce cash flows for both commercial and individual borrowers  which would likely cause peoples to experience increases in problem assets  delinquencies and losses on loans 
investment securities investment securities are initially recorded at cost  which includes premiums and discounts if purchased at other than par or face value 
peoples amortizes premiums and accretes discounts as an adjustment to interest income over the estimated life of the security 
the cost of investment securities sold  and any resulting gain or loss  is based on the specific identification method 
management determines the appropriate classification of investment securities at the time of purchase 
held to maturity securities are those securities that peoples has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost 
available for sale securities are those securities that would be available to be sold in the future in response to peoples liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates  and asset liability management strategies  among other considerations 
available for sale securities are reported at estimated fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income taxes 
presently  peoples classifies its entire investment portfolio as available for sale 
as a result  both the investment and equity sections of peoples balance sheet are more sensitive to changes in the overall market value of the investment portfolio  due to changes in market interest rates  investor confidence and other factors affecting market values  than if the investment portfolio was classified as held to maturity 
while temporary changes in the market value of available for sale securities are not recognized in earnings  a decline in fair value below amortized cost deemed to be other than temporary results in an adjustment to the cost basis of the investment  with a corresponding loss charged against earnings 
management systematically evaluates peoples investment securities for other than temporary declines in estimated fair value on a quarterly basis 
this analysis requires management to consider various factors in order to determine if a decline in estimated fair value is temporary or other than temporary 
these factors include duration and magnitude of the decline in value  the financial condition of the issuer  and peoples ability and intent to continue holding the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
for the year ended december   there were no investment securities identified by management to be other than temporarily impaired 
if investments decline in fair value due to adverse changes in the financial markets  charges to income could occur in future periods 
goodwill and other intangible assets over the past several years  peoples has grown through mergers and acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  peoples is required to allocate the cost of an acquired company to the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
effective june   all future acquisitions must be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting as a result of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
the determination of fair value and subsequent allocation of the cost of an acquired company generally involves management making estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
in addition  the valuation and amortization of intangible assets representing the present value of future net income to be earned from customers commonly referred to as customer relationship intangibles or core deposit intangibles requires significant judgment and the use of estimates by management 
while management feels the assumptions and variables used to value recent acquisitions were reasonable  the use of different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce materially different results 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the non amortization and impairment assessment of goodwill 
in addition  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions sfas  establishes standards for unidentifiable intangible assets acquired specifically in branch purchases that qualify as business combinations 
at december   peoples had million of core deposit and trust relation intangible assets  subject to amortization  and million of goodwill  not subject to periodic amortization 
customer relationship intangibles are required to be amortized over their expected useful life 
the method of amortization should reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up 
since peoples acquired customer relationships are subject to routine customer attrition  the relationships are more likely to produce greater benefits in the near term than in the long term  which would typically necessitate the use of an accelerated method of amortization for the related intangible assets 
management is required to evaluate the useful life of customer relationship intangibles to determine if events or circumstances warrant a change in the estimated life 
should management determine in future periods the estimated life of any intangible asset is shorter than originally estimated  peoples would be required to adjust the amortization of that asset  which could increase future amortization expense 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
goodwill recorded by peoples in connection with its acquisitions relates to the value inherent in the banking business and the value is dependent upon peoples ability to provide quality  cost effective services in a competitive market place 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
under us gaap in effect through december   peoples amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over periods ranging from ten to fifteen years 
effective january   peoples was no longer required to amortize previously recorded goodwill but must perform an annual assessment for impairment as a result of adopting sfas and sfas peoples has reviewed its goodwill assets and has concluded the recorded value of goodwill was not impaired as of december  there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of impairment and using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
additionally  future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and peoples goodwill is impaired  which would result in peoples recording an impairment loss 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material  adverse impact on peoples financial condition and results of operations 
results of operation overview of the income statement in  peoples net income was  or per diluted share  down from  or per diluted share  a year ago 
earnings in were reduced by  or per diluted share  of after tax net charges resulting from balance sheet restructuring in december  which included the long term debt restructuring  investment portfolio restructuring and sale of the credit portfolio  and merger costs incurred in the first half of peoples lower earnings per share in were attributable to continued net interest margin compression resulting from assets repricing downward  coupled with additional common shares outstanding 
alternatively  net income in was positively impacted by peoples repurchase of million of trust preferred securities issued by pebo capital trust i  at a significant discount  resulting in an after tax gain of  or per diluted share 
for the year ended december   net interest income totaled  and net interest margin was compared to  and for the same period in recent acquisitions  coupled with the investment growth strategy in the first quarter of  increased earning assets and produced higher levels of net interest income in net interest margin compression was the result of declining yields on earning assets and limited opportunities for peoples to lower its costs of funds in this low interest rate environment 
other income grew in compared to the prior year  totaling  this increase was attributable to higher deposit service charge income and mortgage banking revenues  while revenues from peoples e banking services and fiduciary activities were also significant contributors 
other income was impacted by securities transactions and asset disposals  which resulted in a net loss of  in versus a net gain of  in  as well as the gain of  on the sale of the credit card portfolio 
non interest expense was million in  up from million for the year ended december  a significant portion of this increase is the result of prepayment penalties of million in conjunction with the long term debt restructuring and increased intangible asset amortization of million 
the remaining increased from the prior year was largely attributable to additional salaries and benefit costs and other operating expenses incurred as a result of the kentucky bancshares acquisition and a full year impact of the first colony acquisition completed in mid interest income and expense peoples derives a majority of its interest income from loans and investment securities and incurs interest expense on interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income  the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense  remains peoples largest source of revenue 
management periodically adjusts the mix of assets and liabilities  as well as the rates earned or paid on those assets and liabilities  in an attempt to manage and improve net interest income 
however  factors that influence market interest rates  such as interest rate changes by the federal reserve open market committee and peoples competitors  may have a greater impact on net interest income than adjustments made by management 
consequently  a volatile rate environment or extended periods of unusually low or high interest rates can make it extremely difficult to manage net interest margin and income in the short term  much less anticipate and position the balance sheet for future changes 
on december   peoples adopted the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  as required 
the adoption of fin caused peoples to deconsolidate its subsidiary grantor trusts  which issued mandatorily redeemable preferred securities to third parties 
as a result  peoples now recognizes the junior subordinated debentures owned by the grantor trusts as liabilities on the balance sheet and the related expense as interest expense versus non interest expense as it had been classified in the past 
peoples elected to apply the requirements of fin retroactively  as permitted  which resulted in the restatement of prior periods and certain financial ratios  including net interest margin 
the adoption of fin  and subsequent restatement  did not have any impact on peoples net income or stockholders equity 
further information regarding peoples adoption of fin can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k under the caption new accounting pronouncements 
in  net interest income grew to  from  for  largely attributable to enhanced interest income due to acquisitions and the investment growth strategy 
interest income totaled  for the year ended december   up  or compared to last year as a result of additional earning assets 
this improvement was partially offset by increased interest expense  which totaled  in versus  in  due mainly to borrowings used in the investment growth strategy and interest bearing deposits acquired through acquisitions 
peoples earns a portion of its interest income from loans to  and investments issued by  states and political subdivisions 
since these revenues generally are not subject to income taxes  management believes it is more meaningful to analyze net interest income on a fully tax equivalent fte basis  which adjusts interest income by converting tax exempt income to the pre tax equivalent of taxable income using an effective tax rate of 
in  interest income was increased by  for the impact of the tax equivalent adjustment  resulting in fte net interest income of  up  or from  in the fte yield on peoples earning assets was and in and  respectively  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities was and for the same periods  respectively 
the lower asset yields and costs of funds reflect the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment 
net interest margin serves as an important measurement of the net revenue stream generated by the mix and pricing of peoples earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
calculated by dividing fte net interest income by average interest earning assets  net interest margin was in versus in peoples net interest margin compressed throughout resulting from high volumes of prepayments in both the loan and investment portfolios and subsequent reinvestment of those funds at significantly lower rates  coupled with limited opportunities for management to lower peoples costs of funds  due to the current low rate environment 
in the fourth quarter of  net interest margin was  down from the prior quarter and a year ago 
the lower net interest margin in the fourth quarter was attributed to a combination of additional premium amortization on mortgage backed securities and decreased interest income on prime based loans 
for the year ended december   earning assets averaged billion  up million compared to billion last year 
net loans comprise the largest portion of peoples earning assets  averaging million in  up from million in due to loans acquired in acquisitions 
the fte yield on net loans was for the year ended december   versus for the prior year  in response to customers refinancing higher rate loans and significant volumes of prime based commercial loan originations 
investment securities averaged million in compared to million in the prior year  with fte yields of and  respectively 
the investment growth strategy implemented during the first quarter of accounted for virtually all of the increase in average balance and much of the decline in yield  due to the low interest rate environment 
in addition  the high rate of prepayments on mortgage backed securities through resulted in accelerated amortization of bond premiums and has caused peoples to reinvest those prepayments in instruments with substantially lower yields 
peoples interest bearing liabilities averaged billion in  up from billion a year ago 
traditional deposits comprise the majority of peoples interest bearing liabilities  averaging million for the year ended december   compared to million in this increase was due largely to deposits acquired as part of acquisitions 
in  the cost of funds from interest bearing deposits was  down from in as a result of market rates remaining at low levels 
however  the impact of the low market rates was partially offset by higher rates paid on longer term certificates of deposit throughout as part of a strategy to shift to longer term funding 
peoples also utilizes a variety of borrowings as complementary funding sources to traditional deposits 
in  total borrowed funds averaged million  up from million a year ago 
the majority of the increase was attributable to borrowed funds used in the investment growth strategy 
while the increased volume produced additional interest expense in  peoples overall cost of borrowed funds dropped to in  from last year  due to the low interest rate environment 
peoples main source of borrowed funds are short and long term advances from the fhlb 
short term fhlb borrowings averaged million in compared to million a year ago  with an average cost of and for the same periods  respectively 
the increased balance was attributable to short term advances used in the investment growth strategy 
average long term fhlb borrowings were up million or compared to the prior year  totaling million for the year ended december   while the average cost dropped to from 
the increase in long term fhlb advances was mainly due to management s efforts to secure longer term funding in late and early in response to this period of low rates 
the long term debt restructuring in mid december resulted in a lower balance of long term fhlb advances at year end management intends to continue using a variety of fhlb borrowings to fund asset growth and manage interest rate sensitivity  as deemed appropriate 
additional information regarding peoples advances from the fhlb can be found later in this discussion under the caption funding sources and in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in addition to fhlb borrowings  peoples also accesses national market repurchase agreements to diversify funding sources 
typically  these repurchase agreements are for terms of days or less 
however  peoples utilized repurchase agreements with terms ranging from to years as part of the investment growth strategy in an effort to match the term of the funding sources with the initial estimated life of the investments 
in  wholesale market term repurchase agreements averaged million at an average cost of  up from million and an average cost of a year ago  due mainly to the investment growth strategy 
as is the case with most financial institutions  peoples continues to experience net interest margin compression as a result of declining asset yields with limited flexibility for a corresponding decrease in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities due in large part to market competition 
while the balance sheet restructuring in the fourth quarter of is expected to have a positive impact on future net interest income and margin  the possibility of additional margin compression remains as long as rates remain at their current low levels 
however  a sustained increase in interest rates in the near future could cause net interest income to increase modestly based on peoples interest rate risk position and asset liability simulations at december  even though management continues to focus on minimizing the impact of future rate changes on earnings  peoples net interest margin and income remain difficult to predict  and to manage  since changes in market interest rates and the timing of these changes remain uncertain 
provision for loan losses peoples provision for loan losses was  in  down from  in the prior year 
this decrease is due largely to peoples good asset quality and lower loan delinquencies 
a portion of the provision relates to the overdraft privilege program  which totaled  and  in and  respectively 
when expressed as a percentage of average loans  the provision was in compared to in management believes the provisions were appropriate for the overall quality  inherent risk and volume concentrations of peoples loan portfolio 
while the sale of the credit card portfolio in late could modestly lower peoples provision for loan losses  future provisions will continue to be based on management s quarterly procedural discipline described in the critical accounting policies section of this discussion 
gains and or losses on securities transactions in  peoples recognized a net loss of  on the sale of investment securities compared to a net gain of  a year ago 
the net loss in is largely the result of the investment portfolio restructuring in the fourth quarter of  while the net gain in was primarily the result of normal portfolio activity 
non interest income peoples generates non interest income from six primary sources deposit account service charges  fiduciary activities  investment and insurance commissions  electronic banking e banking  mortgage banking and business owned life insurance boli 
in  non interest income was  up  or from  a year ago 
peoples enhanced non interest income was primarily the result of higher deposit service charge income and mortgage banking revenues  with e banking services and fiduciary activities also contributing to the increase 
excluding gains and losses on securities transactions  asset disposals and sale of the credit card portfolio  non interest income grew in  totaling  compared to  in peoples largest source of non interest revenue remains service charges and other fees on deposit accounts  which are based on the recovery of costs associated with services provided 
in  deposit account service charges totaled  up  or from  in this increase was the result of higher volumes of overdraft and non sufficient funds nsf fees  combined with increased volumes in transaction accounts for which fees are charged and an overall increase in the number of checking accounts due to acquisitions 
the increased activity caused overdraft and nsf fees to be up  or and  or  respectively  in compared to a year ago 
management periodically evaluates its cost recovery fees to ensure the fees are reasonable based on operational costs  as well as similar fees charged in peoples markets 
due to greater costs and inherent risks associated with deposit account operations  peoples has increased certain cost recovery fees effective january   which should add to deposit account service charge income in  assuming volumes remain stable 
peoples fiduciary revenues improved  or in  totaling  versus  a year ago 
these increases are largely attributable to a one time trust fee of  earned in the third quarter from accounts entitled to a large  special dividend  as well as an increase in trust assets under management due to the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
the relative performance of equity markets  upon which a significant portion of fiduciary fees is based  will continue to influence peoples fiduciary revenues 
late in  peoples began selling long term  fixed rate real estate loans into the secondary market and expanded its mortgage banking activities throughout in  mortgage banking produced revenues of  compared to  a year ago 
a combination of peoples expanded focus and consumers increased demand for fixed rate  long term interest rate mortgage products increased lending opportunities  as customers financed home purchases and refinanced existing loans 
non interest revenues benefited from this combination 
the following table details peoples mortgage banking activity mortgage banking mortgage number of dollars in thousands income loans sold mortgages sold fourth quarter of  third quarter of  second quarter of  first quarter of  fourth quarter of  third quarter of  although it appears the real estate loan refinancing boom may have peaked  mortgage banking is a key part of peoples loan term business strategy 
further information regarding peoples mortgage banking activities can be found later in this discussion under loans 
peoples offers various e banking services  including atm and debit cards  direct deposit services and internet banking  as alternative delivery channels to traditional sales offices for providing services to clients 
peoples electronic banking services generated revenues of  an increase of  or compared to  in this increased revenue was the result of peoples customers utilizing debit cards to complete more of their payment transactions 
in  peoples customers completed over million of debit card transactions  up from million in effective august   peoples  as well as other financial services companies  experienced a reduction in fees earned on certain debit card transactions as a result of the visa and mastercard litigation settlement 
despite the reduced fee structure  peoples e banking revenues remained strong in the second half of  totaling  and  in the fourth and third quarters of  compared to  and  for the same periods in  respectively 
management currently does not plan to implement new fees for customers using its debit cards to offset any decline in revenues but rather  plans to partially offset the reduced income stream by continuing to grow core deposits  issuing more debit cards  and encouraging customers to use their debit cards as a convenient way to do their banking 
insurance and investment commissions totaled  in versus  in the decline in insurance and investment income is largely attributable to lower volumes of fixed annuity sales and related commission income 
in addition  decreased consumer lending opportunities in impacted peoples credit life and accident and health a h insurance commissions 
the following table details peoples insurance and investment commissions dollars in thousands property and casualty insurance fixed annuities  brokerage life and health insurance credit life and a h insurance reinsurance revenues total    peoples boli investment enhances operating efficiency by offsetting rising employee benefit costs 
in  boli income totaled  compared to  in management believes the boli yields should continue to provide a better return for funding future benefit costs than alternative investment opportunities with similar or lesser risk characteristics 
non interest expense in  non interest expense totaled  up  or from  a year ago 
the fhlb prepayment penalties accounted for over half of this increase  while  of additional intangible asset amortization due to recent acquisitions also significantly contributed to the increase 
excluding the impact of early debt extinguishment and intangible amortization  non interest expense rose in compared to the prior year largely attributable to additional expenses incurred as a result of the kentucky bancshares acquisition and a full year impact of the first colony acquisition completed in mid salaries and benefits remain peoples largest operating expense  which is inherent in a service based industry such as financial services 
for the year ended december   salaries and benefits grew  or to  from  in most of the increase was due to the addition of approximately new associates in conjunction with acquisitions 
at december   peoples had full time equivalent associates  up from at year end management will continue to leverage peoples resources in an effort to optimize customer service and produce additional future revenue streams 
recent investments in technology and acquisitions have produced additional net occupancy and equipment expenses  in particular depreciation expense 
in  net occupancy and equipment expenses totaled  versus  last year 
the continued investment in technology has enhanced peoples ability to serve clients and satisfy their financial needs  while acquisitions have allowed peoples to expand its customer base for economies of scale 
data processing and software costs totaled  in  up from a year ago 
the higher level of data processing and software costs is attributable to an increase in software licensing fees in response to additional office locations and users of key software packages 
beginning in the third quarter of  peoples began amortizing its million investment in customer relationship management crm and profitability systems  the majority of which was software related costs 
the total investment is estimated to be amortizable over a year period 
while this investment will add future expense  these new systems and processes will be a strategic part of peoples sales and marketing efforts for many years and is consistent with management s long term focus to build the best process to grow revenues 
professional fees  which include fees for accounting  legal and other professional services  totaled  in  down  or compared to  a year ago 
included in peoples professional fees are consulting fees paid for the implementation of the overdraft privilege program in december these costs  which are based on the net improvement in overdraft fee income  totaled  in versus  for the months that the fee was paid in in the fourth quarter of  these consulting fees were  versus  a year ago  as the fee percentage was reduced beginning in march and will terminate at the end of the first quarter of peoples is subject to state franchise taxes  which are based largely on peoples bank s equity 
in  franchise taxes totaled  a increase over last year s total of  this increase is attributable to additional equity at peoples bank  which was due largely to equity added by the kentucky bancshares and first colony acquisitions and the million capital contribution from peoples 
despite the increased franchise taxes  management believes peoples bank s stronger capital level positions peoples for strategic growth 
in addition  management regularly evaluates the capital position of peoples other direct and indirect subsidiaries and seeks to maximize peoples consolidated capital position through appropriate capital allocation designed to enhance profitability and shareholder value 
management uses the non interest leverage ratio as a measurement of non interest expense leverage 
for the year ended december   the non interest leverage ratio was compared to a year ago 
this improvement in the non interest leverage ratio reflects peoples ability to increase revenues without a corresponding increase in operating expenses 
management s strategic goals include achieving and maintaining a non interest leverage ratio greater than 
the non interest ratio is defined as non interest income as a percentage of operating expenses  which excludes gains and losses on securities transactions  asset disposals  early debt extinguishment  and sale of the credit card portfolio  as well as intangible asset amortization 
the followings details the components of the non interest leverage ratio calculation for the year ended december dollars in thousands total other income  as reported   add loss on asset disposals loss on securities transactions  deduct gain on securities transactions gain on sale of credit card portfolio  adjusted total other income   total other expense  as reported   add gain on early debt extinguishment deduct loss on early debt extinguishment  amortization of other intangible assets  adjusted total other expense   return on equity in  peoples return on equity roe was versus a year ago 
the lower roe is primarily the result of decreased earnings from balance sheet restructuring charges in the fourth quarter  coupled with higher average equity generated by the common stock offering  and the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
average equity was million for  a million or increase over the average equity for management uses roe to evaluate peoples long term performance 
however  management believes earnings per share eps serves as a more meaningful measurement of short term performance due to the volatility that can occur to equity from changes in the estimated fair values of peoples investment portfolio 
return on assets return on assets roa was in compared to in the reduction in roa is primarily due to peoples lower earnings and an increase in total average assets from the investment growth strategy and kentucky bancshares acquisition 
average assets were billion in compared to s average balance of million  a increase 
in recent years  peoples primary focus has shifted to eps enhancement and roe while reducing the emphasis on roa as a key performance indicator 
however  management continues to monitor roa and considers it a measurement of peoples asset utilization 
income tax expense peoples effective tax rate was for the year ended december   compared to a year ago 
this decline resulted from tax exempt interest income comprising a larger percentage of peoples income before taxes 
peoples also makes tax advantaged investments in order to manage its effective tax rate and overall tax burden 
at december   the amount of tax advantaged investments included in other assets totaled million compared to million at december  this increase in tax advantaged investments produced additional tax benefits  which also contributed to the reduction in peoples effective tax rate 
depending on economic and regulatory conditions  peoples may make additional investments in various tax credit pools and other tax advantaged assets 
financial condition overview of balance sheet at december   total assets were billion compared to billion at year end  due to an increase in investments and loans 
the investment growth strategy resulted in investment securities totaling million at december   up million or since december  gross loans were million year end  up million or since december   largely attributable to the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
goodwill and unamortized other intangible assets were million higher at year end compared to december   as a result of the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
total liabilities were billion at december   compared to billion at year end  an increase of million or 
at december   deposits totaled billion versus million at year end  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily the result of deposits acquired in the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
borrowed funds totaled million at december   up from million at december   due to borrowings used  for the most part  to fund the investment growth strategy 
stockholders equity totaled million at december   versus million at december   an increase of million or 
the majority of this increase is due to common shares issued in conjunction with the kentucky bancshares acquisition and common stock offering  which increased equity by million 
cash and cash equivalents peoples considers cash and cash equivalents to consist of federal funds sold  cash and balances due from banks  interest bearing balances in other institutions and other short term investments that are readily liquid 
the amount of cash and cash equivalents fluctuates on a daily basis due to customer activity and peoples liquidity needs 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  up compared to million at december  this increase was attributable to a higher level of federal funds sold 
at december   peoples had million of federal funds sold compared to million at year end this increase is attributable to peoples placing accumulated funds from the investment portfolio and customer activity into federal funds sold 
cash and balances due from banks comprised a significant portion of peoples cash and cash equivalents 
at december   cash and balances due from banks totaled million  down from million at year end this decline was the result of fewer items in the process of collection at december management believes the current balance of cash and cash equivalents  along with the availability of other funding sources  will allow peoples to meet cash obligations  special needs and off balance sheet commitments  specifically undrawn lines of credit  construction loans and letters of credit  as they come due 
peoples will actively manage the principal runoff from the investment and loan portfolios and seek to reinvest those funds appropriately  based on loan demand and investment opportunities  while maintaining adequate liquidity 
further information regarding peoples liquidity can be found later in this discussion under interest rate sensitivity and liquidity 
investment securities at december   the amortized cost of peoples investment securities totaled million compared to million at year end  while the market value of the investment portfolio was million at december   up from million at december  these increases were primarily the result of the investment growth strategy initiated in december and implemented in the first quarter of the difference in amortized cost and market value at december   resulted in unrealized appreciation in the investment portfolio of million and a corresponding increase in peoples equity of million  net of deferred taxes 
in comparison  the difference in amortized cost and market value at december   resulted in unrealized appreciation of million and an increase in equity of million  net of deferred taxes 
since december   peoples investment in us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies and corporations  excluding mortgage backed securities  has grown million or 
this increase is the result of management reallocating a portion of the runoff from the investment portfolio into us agency securities to maintain diversity within the portfolio  as well as peoples acquiring approximately million of us agency securities in the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
peoples investment in mortgage backed securities has grown significantly compared to year end due to the investment growth strategy 
in  management took various actions to improve the performance of peoples investment securities portfolio in response to the high rate of prepayments on mortgage backed securities and the corresponding downward pressure on yields due to accelerated amortization of bond premiums 
specifically  peoples sold lower yielding mortgage backed securities  due to increased prepayment speeds  in mid and late in the fourth quarter of and reinvested the proceeds into higher yielding instruments 
management expects the repositioning to improve both the yields and the timing of cash flows from the investment portfolio 
further information regarding peoples investment securities can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
management monitors the earnings performance and liquidity of the investment portfolio on a regular basis through asset liability committee alco meetings 
the alco also monitors net interest income  sets deposit pricing and maturity guidelines  and manages peoples interest rate risk 
through active management of the balance sheet and investment portfolio  peoples seeks to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy depositor demand  other company liquidity requirements and various credit needs of its customers 
loans peoples bank originates various types of loans  including commercial  financial and agricultural loans commercial loans  real estate loans and consumer loans  focusing primarily on lending opportunities in central and southeastern ohio  northwestern west virginia  and northeastern kentucky markets 
at december   gross loans totaled million  up million since year end while this increase was primarily attributable to loans acquired in the kentucky bancshares acquisition  peoples has also experienced internally generated commercial loan growth throughout  which partially offset declines in real estate and consumer loan balances 
commercial loan balances  including loans secured by commercial real estate  totaled million at december   up million or from million at year end a significant portion of this increase in commercial loans is attributable to acquiring million of commercial loans in the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
peoples also experienced internally generated growth from lending opportunities within peoples existing markets 
commercial loans continued to represent the largest portion of peoples total loan portfolio  comprising and of total loans at december  and december   respectively 
the portion of commercial loan balances secured by commercial real estate  excluding construction loans  was million at december   up from million at december  future commercial lending activities will be dependent on economic and related conditions  such as general demand for loans in peoples primary markets  interest rates offered by peoples and normal underwriting requirements 
in addition to in market opportunities  peoples will continue to lend selectively to creditworthy customers outside its primary markets 
while commercial loans comprise the largest portion of peoples loan portfolio  generating residential real estate loans remains a major focus of peoples lending efforts  whether the loans are ultimately sold into the secondary market or retained on peoples balance sheet 
at december   real estate loans  which include construction loans but exclude loans secured by commercial real estate  totaled million compared to million at december   a decrease of million or 
this decline is due mainly to peoples increased secondary market activity  which was partially offset by peoples acquiring million of real estate loans in the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
real estate loans comprised of peoples total loan portfolio at december   versus at year end included in real estate loans are home equity credit line balances of million at december   virtually unchanged from million at december  throughout  real estate loan balances declined in response to customer preference for long term  fixed rate mortgages  which peoples predominately designates for sale in the secondary market with servicing rights retained 
in  peoples originated long term  fixed rate mortgage loans  with total loan amounts of million  for sale into the secondary market  compared to loans  with total loan amounts of million  in at december   peoples was servicing million of real estate loans previously sold into the secondary market 
in addition  peoples had million of fixed rate real estate loans that could be sold into the secondary market 
management anticipates peoples selling these loans during the first quarter of consumer loans decreased million or since year end  totaling million at december  as part of the kentucky bancshares acquisition  peoples acquired consumer loan balances of million 
the indirect lending area represented a significant portion of peoples consumer loans  with balances of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
slower economic conditions and strong competition for loans  particularly automobile loans  have challenged the performance and growth of peoples consumer loan portfolio  even so  management remains committed to sound lending practices and continues to emphasize appropriate discipline in loan pricing and loan underwriting practices more than loan growth 
loan concentration peoples largest concentration of commercial loans are credits to lodging and lodging related companies  which comprised approximately of peoples outstanding commercial loans at year end  compared to at december  loans to assisted living facilities and nursing homes also represented a significant portion of peoples commercial loans  comprising of peoples outstanding commercial loans at december   versus at year end these lending opportunities have arisen due to the growth of these industries in markets served by peoples or contiguous areas  as well as sales associates efforts to develop these lending relationships 
management believes peoples loans to lodging and lodging related companies  as well as loans to assisted living facilities and nursing homes  do not pose abnormal risk when compared to risk assumed in other types of lending since these credits have been subjected to peoples normal underwriting standards  which includes an evaluation of the market expertise and experience of the borrowers and principals in these business relationships 
in addition  a sizeable portion of the loans to lodging and lodging related companies are spread over various geographic areas and are guaranteed by principals with substantial net worth 
allowance for loan losses peoples allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of total loans  at december   compared to million  or  at year end over one third of the increase in the allowance was the result of the allowance for loan losses acquired in the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
the allowance is allocated among the loan categories based upon the consistent  quarterly procedural discipline described in the critical accounting policies section of this discussion 
however  the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb future loan losses in any loan category 
the following schedule details the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december dollars in thousands percent percent percent allocation of loans allocation of loans allocation of loans of in each of in each of in each allowance category allowance category allowance category for loan to total for loan to total for loan to total losses loans losses loans losses loans commercial    consumer    real estate    overdrafts credit card total    the allowance allocated to commercial loans has increased in recent periods  reflecting the higher credit risk associated with this type of lending and continued growth in this portfolio 
the allowance allocated to the real estate and consumer loan portfolios is based upon peoples allowance methodology for homogeneous pools of loans  which includes a consideration of changes in total balances in those portfolios 
in  net chargeoffs were down compared to  totaling  versus  consumer loans comprise the largest portion of net chargeoffs  totaling  in versus  a year ago 
net chargeoffs relating to the overdraft privilege program were  and  in and  respectively 
while commercial loans remain a significant portion of net chargeoffs  commercial loan chargeoffs were down in due largely to peoples charging down million of loans from a single client relationship during the first half of real estate loans comprised  of net chargeoffs in  up from  a year ago 
asset quality remains a key focus  as management continues to stress quality rather than growth 
since december   peoples asset quality ratios have improved due to the combination of a lower level of nonperforming loans and an increase in assets 
in  the balance of nonperforming loans decreased due to a large commercial loan  which comprised the entire amount of renegotiated loans at december   moving to performing status 
nonperforming assets comprise a smaller percentage of total assets at december   as a result of an increase in assets largely attributable to the completion of the investment growth strategy and the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
nonperforming loans increased in due to additional loans  primarily commercial and real estate loans  being placed on nonaccrual status  as slow economic conditions have negatively impacted customers ability to meet their loan repayment obligations 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that peoples will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of potential impaired loan losses is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s contractual effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if foreclosure is probable  impairment loss is measured based on the fair value of the collateral 
at december   the recorded investment in loans considered to be impaired was million  of which million were accruing interest and million were nonaccrual loans 
included in this amount were million of impaired loans for which the related allowance for loan losses was million 
the remaining impaired loan balances do not have a related allocation of the allowance for loan losses because the loans have been previously written down  are well secured  or possess characteristics indicative of the ability to repay the loan 
for the year ended december   peoples average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately million and interest income of million was recognized on impaired loans during the period  representing of peoples total interest income 
funding sources peoples considers a number of sources when evaluating funding needs  including but not limited to deposits  short term borrowings  and long term borrowings 
deposits  both interest bearing and non interest bearing  continue to be the most significant source of funds for peoples  totaling billion  or of total funding sources  at december  non interest bearing deposits serve as a core funding source 
at december   non interest bearing deposit balances totaled million  up million or compared to the prior year end  with the kentucky bancshares acquisition accounting for substantially all of the increase 
in addition  non interest bearing deposit balances at year end included million of trust funds  which were not invested at year end at the customer s request 
these funds were invested in a market based product in early january since customer activity can result in temporary changes in deposit balances at end of periods  management believes a comparison of average balances to be a more meaningful reflection of the trend in non interest bearing deposits 
in  non interest bearing deposits averaged million versus in  reflecting peoples efforts to increase non interest bearing deposits 
peoples strategies include continued emphasis on core deposit growth in products such as non interest bearing checking accounts 
interest bearing deposits totaled million at december   an increase of million or compared to million at december   all of which was attributable to the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
the following details peoples interest bearing deposits at december dollars in thousands certificates of deposit    savings accounts    interest bearing transaction accounts    money market deposit accounts    total interest bearing deposits    peoples also accesses other funding sources  including short term and long term borrowings  to fund asset growth and satisfy liquidity needs 
peoples short term borrowings include overnight repurchase agreements and fhlb advances  while long term borrowings include fhlb advances  a loan from an unrelated financial institution and term repurchase agreements 
at december   borrowed funds totaled million  up million or from million at year end  as a result of the investment growth strategy 
as part of the long term debt restructuring in december  peoples converted a million long term borrowings to a short term borrowing 
this increase in short term borrowings was partially offset by peoples converting the short term loan utilized to fund the first colony acquisition in to a long term loan with the same unaffiliated financial institution 
total long term borrowings were up in due to the investment growth strategy 
advances from the fhlb comprise a significant portion of peoples borrowed funds 
short term fhlb advances are typically variable rate cash management advances used to manage peoples daily liquidity needs and may be repaid  in whole or part  at anytime without a penalty 
peoples also utilizes short term  repo advances ranging in terms from overnight to one year to manage its cost of funds and temporary cash needs 
peoples long term fhlb advances are primarily convertible rate advances  with the initial rate fixed for periods ranging from two to four years  depending on the specific advance 
after the initial fixed rate period  these advances are subject to conversion  at the discretion of the fhlb  to a libor based  variable rate product 
peoples has the option to prepay  without penalty  any advance that has been converted or allow the borrowing to reprice 
in addition to these convertible rate advances  peoples utilizes fixed rate  long term fhlb advances  both amortizing and non amortizing  to help manage its interest rate sensitivity and liquidity 
further information regarding peoples management of interest rate sensitivity can be found later in this discussion under interest rate sensitivity and liquidity 
in addition to fhlb advances  peoples accesses national market repurchase agreements to diversify its funding sources 
at december   wholesale repurchase agreements totaled million versus million at year end  due to repurchase agreements used to fund the investment growth strategy 
peoples current wholesale repurchase agreements range in original terms of two to five years 
the repurchase agreements may not be repaid prior to maturity and must remain sufficiently collateralized during the entire term 
as a result  a decline in the market value of the investment securities associated with these agreements would require peoples to pledge additional investment securities 
capital stockholders equity at december   stockholders equity was million  versus million at december   an increase of million or 
the majority of this increase is due to common shares issued in conjunction with the kentucky bancshares acquisition and the common stock offering  which accounted for million and million of the increase  respectively 
for the year ended december   peoples paid dividends of million  representing a dividend payout ratio of of earnings  compared to a ratio of a year ago 
while management anticipates peoples continuing its year history of consistent dividend growth in future periods  peoples bancorp s ability to pay dividends on its common shares is largely dependent upon dividends from peoples bank 
in addition  other restrictions and limitations may prohibit peoples from paying dividends even when sufficient cash is available 
further discussion regarding restrictions on peoples ability to pay future dividends can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  as well as the limits on dividends section under item of this form k 
the adjustment for the net unrealized holding gains on available for sale securities  net of deferred income taxes  impacts peoples total equity 
at december   net unrealized holding gains totaled million versus million at december   a change of million 
since all the investment securities in peoples portfolio are classified as available for sale  both the investment and equity sections of peoples consolidated balance sheet are more sensitive to the changing market values of investments than if the investment portfolio was classified as held to maturity 
at december   peoples had treasury stock totaling million  nearly double the amount at year end during  peoples repurchased  common shares or of the total authorized  at an average price of per share  under the stock repurchase program  and  common shares  at an average price of  in conjunction with the deferred compensation plan for directors of peoples and subsidiaries 
during the same period  peoples reissued  of the shares purchased under the stock repurchase program as part of the kentucky bancshares acquisition  stock option exercises and stock dividend 
in  peoples has repurchased  shares or of the total authorized  at an average price of per share  through february   under the stock repurchase program 
peoples anticipates repurchasing additional common shares as authorized in the stock repurchase program 
management uses the tangible capital ratio as one measure of the adequacy of peoples equity 
the ratio  defined as tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets  excludes the balance sheet impact of intangible assets acquired through acquisitions accounted for using the purchase method accounting 
at december   peoples tangible capital ratio was compared to at september  and at december  the lower ratio compared to the prior year end is the result of an increase in assets due to the investment growth strategy and intangible assets acquired in the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
in addition to monitoring performance through traditional capital measurements ie  dividend payout ratios and roe  peoples has also complied with the capital adequacy standards mandated by the banking industry 
peoples and peoples bank were categorized as well capitalized institutions at december   based on the most recent regulatory notification 
further information regarding peoples risk based capital ratios can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
interest rate sensitivity and liquidity while peoples is exposed to various business risks  the risks relating to interest rate sensitivity and liquidity could materially impact future results of operation and financial condition 
the objective of peoples asset liability management alm function is to measure and manage these risks in order to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity and safety 
this objective requires peoples to focus on interest rate risk exposure and adequate liquidity through management of the mix of assets and liabilities 
ultimately  the alm function is intended to guide management in the acquisition of earning assets and selection of the appropriate funding sources 
interest rate risk interest rate risk irr is one of the most significant risks for peoples  and the entire financial services industry  primarily arising in the normal course of business of offering a wide array of financial products to its customers  including loans and deposits  as well as the diversity of its own investment portfolio and borrowed funds 
irr is the potential for economic loss due to future interest rate changes that can impact both the earnings stream as well as market values of financial assets and liabilities 
peoples exposure to irr is due primarily to differences in the maturity  or repricing  of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  other factors  such as prepayments of loans and investment securities or early withdrawal of deposits  can expose peoples to irr and increase interest costs or reduce revenue streams 
peoples has charged the alco with the overall management of peoples balance sheet mix and off balance sheet hedging transactions related to the management of irr 
the alco consists of peoples chief financial  officer  chief executive officer and chief lending officer  as well as other members of senior management 
it is the alco s responsibility to focus on the future by evaluating trends and potential future events  researching alternatives  then recommending and authorizing an appropriate course of action 
to this end  the alco has established an irr management policy that sets the minimum requirements and guidelines for monitoring and managing the level and amount of irr 
the objective of the irr policy is to encourage adherence to sound fundamentals of banking while allowing sufficient flexibility to exercise the creativity and innovation necessary to meet the challenges and opportunities of changing markets 
the ultimate goal of these policies is to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity  and safety 
peoples alco relies on different methods of assessing irr  including simulations to project future net interest income and to monitor the sensitivity of the net present market value of equity and the difference  or gap  between maturing or repricing of rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various time periods 
peoples uses these methods to monitor irr for both the short and long term 
the alco places emphasis on simulation modeling as the most beneficial measurement of irr because it is a dynamic measure 
by employing a simulation process that estimates the impact of potential changes in interest rates and balance sheet structures and by establishing limits on these estimated changes to net income and net market value  the alco is better able to evaluate interest rate risks and their potential impact to earnings and the market value of equity 
the modeling process starts with a base case simulation using the current balance sheet and current interest rates held constant for the next twelve months 
at least two alternative interest rate scenarios  one with higher interest rates and one with lower interest rates  assuming parallel  immediate and sustained changes are also prepared using the same balance sheet structure as the base scenario 
comparisons produced from the simulation data  showing the earnings variance from the base interest rate scenario  illustrate the risks associated with the current balance sheet structure 
additional simulations  when deemed appropriate  are prepared using different interest rate scenarios than those used with the base case simulation and or possible changes in balance sheet structure 
the additional simulations are used to better evaluate risks and highlight opportunities inherent in the modeled balance sheet 
comparisons showing the earnings and equity value variance from the base case are provided to the alco for review and discussion 
the results from these model simulations are evaluated for indications of effectiveness of current irr management strategies 
as part of the evaluation of irr  the alco has established limits on changes in net interest income and the net value of the balance sheet 
the alco limits the decrease in net interest income of peoples bank to or less from base case for each basis point shift in interest rates measured over a twelve month period assuming a static balance sheet 
the alco limits the negative impact on net equity to or less given an immediate and sustained basis points shift in interest rates  also assuming a static balance sheet 
the alco also reviews static gap measures for specific time periods focusing on a one year cumulative gap 
at december   peoples one year cumulative gap amount was positive of earning assets  which represented million more in assets than liabilities that may reprice or mature during that period 
based on historical trends and performance  the alco has determined the ratio of the one year cumulative gap should be within of earning assets at the date of measurement 
results that are outside of any of these limits will prompt a discussion by the alco of appropriate actions  if any  that should be taken 
the following table is provided to illustrate the estimated earnings at risk and value at risk positions of peoples  on a pre tax basis  at december  dollars in thousands immediate interest rate estimated estimated increase decrease in decrease increase decrease increase in basis points in net interest income economic value of equity the interest rate risk analysis shows that peoples is asset sensitive  which means that increasing interest rates should favorably impact peoples net interest income while downward moving interest rates should negatively impact net interest income 
peoples asset sensitivity increased slightly during as efforts were made by management to increase the amount of assets that reprice in relation to repricing liabilities 
the alco has also implemented hedge positions to help protect peoples net interest income streams in the event of rising rates which will complement the current slightly asset sensitive position 
peoples has a hedge position on a million long term  fixed rate borrowing from the fhlb that may convert to a variable rate  at the fhlb s discretion 
in addition  the alco may consider additional hedging options  including  but not limited to  the purchase of other interest rate hedge positions  as available and appropriate  that would provide net interest income protection in a rising rate environment 
liquidity in addition to irr management  a primary objective of the alco is the maintenance of a sufficient level of liquidity 
the alco defines liquidity as the ability to meet anticipated and unanticipated operating cash needs  loan demand  and deposit withdrawals  without incurring a sustained negative impact on profitability 
the alco s liquidity management policy sets limits on the net liquidity position of peoples and the concentration of non core funding sources  both total wholesale funding and reliance on brokered deposits 
typically  the main source of liquidity for peoples is deposit growth 
liquidity is also provided from cash generated from earning assets such as maturities  calls  principal payments and income from loans and investment securities 
in  cash provided by financing activities totaled million compared to million a year ago  due largely to increased long term borrowings used for the investment growth strategy 
cash used in investing activities totaled million versus million last year  primarily due to increased investment securities purchases  net of maturities and sales 
when appropriate  peoples takes advantage of external sources of funds  such as advances from the fhlb  national market repurchase agreements  and brokered funds 
these external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that better enable peoples to match funding dates and pricing characteristics with contractual maturity dates and pricing parameters of earning assets 
at december   peoples had available borrowing capacity of approximately million through these external sources and unpledged securities in the investment portfolio of approximately million that can be utilized as an additional source of liquidity 
the net liquidity position of peoples is calculated by subtracting volatile funds from liquid assets 
peoples volatile funds consist primarily of short term growth in deposits  while liquid assets includes short term investments and unpledged available for sale securities 
at december   peoples net liquidity position was million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  at december  the increase in liquidity position as a percent of total assets was primarily the result of a decrease in volatile funds 
the liquidity position as of december   was within peoples policy limit of negative of total assets 
at december   total wholesale funding comprised of total assets and brokered funds were of total assets  which was within peoples policy limits of and  respectively 
off balance sheet activities and contractual obligations peoples routinely engages in activities that involve  to varying degrees  elements of risk that are not reflected  in whole or in part  in the consolidated financial statements 
these activities are part of peoples normal course of business and include traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments  interest rate contracts  operating leases  long term debt and commitments to make additional capital contributions in low income housing project investments 
traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments are primarily commitments to extend credit  and standby letters of credit 
these activities could require peoples to make cash payments to third parties in the event certain specified future events occur 
the contractual amounts represent the extent of peoples exposure in these off balance sheet activities 
however  since certain off balance sheet commitments  particularly standby letters of credit  are expected to expire or be only partially used  the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
these activities are necessary to meet the financing needs of customers 
peoples also enters into interest rate contracts where peoples is required to either receive cash from or pay cash to counter parties depending on changes in interest rates 
peoples utilizes interest rate contracts to help manage the risk of changing interest rates 
interest rate contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
as a result  the amounts recorded on the balance sheet at december   do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid or received under these contracts 
peoples also has commitments to make additional capital contributions in low income housing tax credit funds  consisting of a pool of low income housing projects 
as a limited partner in these funds  peoples receives federal income tax benefits  which assist peoples in managing its overall tax burden 
since the future contributions are conditioned on certain future events occurring  the total amount of delayed equity contributions is not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet at december  further information regarding peoples delayed equity contributions can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
management does not anticipate peoples current off balance sheet activities will have a material impact on future results of operations and financial condition 
further information regarding peoples financial instruments with off balance sheet risk can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
peoples continues to lease certain banking facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases with terms providing for fixed monthly payments over periods ranging from two to fifteen years 
many of peoples leased banking facilities are located within retail shopping centers and  as a result  are not available for purchase 
management believes these leased facilities increase peoples visibility within its markets and afford sales associates additional access to current and potential clients 
the following table details peoples future contractual obligations under certain contractual obligations payments due by period dollars in thousands less than more than total year years years years long term debt      operating leases   time deposits     total      amounts reflect the minimum principal payments required under peoples long term debt agreements 
effects of inflation on financial statements substantially all of peoples assets relate to banking and are monetary in nature 
as a result  inflation does not impact peoples to the same degree as companies in capital intensive industries in a replacement cost environment 
during a period of rising prices  a net monetary asset position results in a loss in purchasing power and conversely a net monetary liability position results in an increase in purchasing power 
the opposite would be true during a period of decreasing prices 
in the banking industry  typically monetary assets exceed monetary liabilities 
the current monetary policy targeting low levels of inflation has resulted in relatively stable price levels 
therefore  inflation has had little impact on peoples net assets 
future outlook in  peoples results reflect the difficulty of building upon the success of  especially considering the challenging economic and interest rate conditions in the markets served 
although these adverse conditions challenged earnings  management continues to focus on creating long term value for stakeholders 
consistent with this long term focus  management believes the series of transactions to restructure peoples balance sheet  while negatively impacting earnings  better positions peoples for long term earnings growth 
in the meantime  peoples strong capital position  coupled with management s commitment to sound underwriting discipline and asset quality  provides a solid foundation to withstand significant negative impact of the current business environment 
much of peoples success in recent years is a reflection of the dedication and efforts of peoples professional  community minded associate base 
management understands future success requires peoples to fairly compensate its associates through salaries  incentives and other benefits 
as with virtually every company  rising employee benefit expense  particularly medical insurance costs  have caused management to explore ways  such as the purchase of business owned life insurance or boli  to offset the increased costs in order to avoid reducing benefits provided to associates  and to remain competitive for talented professionals 
in mid february  peoples purchased an additional million of boli to add to the million of boli on peoples balance sheet at december  the additional boli is expected to produce about million of additional tax advantaged non interest income in thereby enhancing operating efficiency 
controlling operating expenses remains a strategic focus  particularly in this low interest rate environment 
in addition  the rationalization of peoples delivery channels  particularly sales offices  is a constant theme 
in  management decided to sell one office building  consolidate offices in kentucky and expanded another in central ohio 
these actions should produce benefits in and beyond 
assuming other fees remain stable  professional fees should decrease at the end of the first quarter of  as the relationship with the consulting firm that assisted peoples in its implementation of the overdraft privilege program will expire 
these expected cost reductions in should offset some of the increased expense associated with the crm profitability project  as well as the full year impact of the kentucky bancshares acquisition and possible increases in state franchise taxes 
management continues to monitor costs to ensure resources are allocated wisely to projects that produce long term benefits 
since  peoples bank has successfully underwritten credit cards and managed the process internally  which has produced a stable net revenue stream 
in recent years  competition for credit cards has intensified due largely to the dominance of several larger financial companies and has limited peoples ability to grow its credit card portfolio and net revenue 
as a result  peoples marketed its credit card as a complementary product offering for client relationships rather than incur additional and or unnecessary risk merely for such growth 
however  customers have demanded product enhancements  such as rewards programs  which forced management to reevaluate how peoples made available credit card services 
this evaluation resulted in a decision to sell peoples credit card portfolio in late and form an affiliation with an unaffiliated financial institution 
earnings in should benefit from the sale considering the investment of sale proceeds  cost savings in operations and collections  and the revenue sharing opportunities peoples has under the new alliance 
loan growth is an integral part of peoples strategic goals in  as lenders work to further penetrate stronger markets in central ohio and western west virginia 
management anticipates a portion of loan growth will result from peoples retaining a larger percentage of its residential mortgage loans rather than selling them into the secondary markets 
with the credit card portfolio sale  commercial loans now comprise over half of peoples loan portfolio and consumer loans represent less than 
management expects to evaluate peoples personal lending processes in to analyze the relative profitability of underwriting activities in areas such as indirect lending  where volumes have dropped dramatically due to fierce competition 
meanwhile  peoples will continue to aggressively solicit commercial  real estate and home equity credit lines as a way to further penetrate its markets 
mergers and acquisitions have been an integral part of peoples efforts to expand its operations and customer base  thereby continuing to provide opportunities to build client relationships and sell new products and services in order to enhance peoples earnings potential 
peoples strong regulatory capital ratios afford management additional growth opportunities through mergers and acquisitions and market expansion 
with a higher level of tangible equity to total assets  management believes peoples is positioned to continue its disciplined acquisition strategy of the past decade and has dedicated more resources to develop and realize acquisition opportunities in and around peoples markets 
while peoples has completed several traditional banking acquisitions in recent years  management s evaluation of future acquisitions will include insurance agency and professional investment services firms 
ultimately  the assessment of potential acquisitions will emphasize opportunities to complement peoples core competencies and strategic intent 
peoples remains a service oriented company with a sales focus that strives to satisfy clients through a relationship sales process 
through this process  sales associates work to anticipate  uncover  and solve their clients every financial need  from insurance to banking to investment services 
in  management expects earnings catalysts to include continued loan growth  revenue enhancements from the credit card alliance formed in fourth quarter and balance sheet repositioning  boli purchases  and some lower operating expenses from decreased professional fees 
management remains stakeholder focused with four key long term objectives best achieved in more normal economic conditions and interest rate environments to operating eps growth per year  roe of to  consistent dividend growth and a non interest leverage ratio better than

comparison of to peoples reported net income of million in  up from million in diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december   compared to in in  peoples improved earnings resulted from net interest income growth of million  as well as increased non interest revenues of million 
earnings in were also positively impacted by new accounting rules for goodwill  which allowed peoples to cease amortization of goodwill effective january   and the repurchase of million of trust preferred securities issued by pebo capital trust i at a gain of million 
excluding goodwill amortization  diluted earnings per share would have been in return on average assets was in  compared to in  while return on stockholders equity was and  for the same periods respectively 
peoples enhanced return on equity and return on assets was largely the result of increased earnings 
net interest income totaled million in  up compared to the prior year  as total interest income decreased to million and interest expense declined to million 
net interest margin was in versus in peoples improved net interest margin in resulted from lower costs of funds in response to rates dropping throughout and remaining at very low levels 
the yield on earning assets decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities dropped basis points to during the same period 
peoples provision for loan losses totaled million in  up from s expense of million 
this increase was largely due to provisions relating to the first full year s impact of the overdraft privilege program  which totaled  in versus  the prior year 
in addition  the combination of increased loan volume  less favorable loss experience  and sluggish economic conditions resulted in the increased provision in at december   peoples allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was  compared to a year end ratio of 
non interest income totaled million in  an increase of compared to attributed to higher deposit account service charge income 
in  deposit account service charge income increased million or  to million  as a result of higher volumes of overdraft and non sufficient fund fees 
peoples implementation of the overdraft privilege program and other changes to the assessment of cost recovery fees in late accounted for the higher fees in another major contributor was a full year s impact of revenue from peoples boli  as income grew to million in from million in insurance and investment commissions grew to million in in response to strong fixed annuity sales and additional property and casualty insurance commissions 
electronic banking revenues  primarily atm and debit card fees  increased to million 
fiduciary revenues of million in were unchanged compared to for the year ended december   non interest expense totaled million  up compared to million in increased salaries and benefits and professional fees accounted for the majority of the expense growth in salaries and benefits were million versus million the prior year 
the addition of several new associates in the first colony acquisition in mid produced higher salaries and benefits 
professional fees grew million or to million and marketing expense grew million in to million 
these increases were due to costs associated with peoples free checking and overdraft privilege program 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by substantially lower intangible amortization expense as a result of new accounting rules for goodwill 
in  peoples had no goodwill amortization versus million in peoples also experienced modest increases in occupancy and equipment expense and data processing and software costs  due in part to acquisitions 
the combination of strong revenues and controlled expense growth enhanced peoples non interest leverage ratio 
in  the non interest leverage ratio improved to compared to in total assets reached billion at december   versus billion at year end gross loans remained the largest component of peoples earning assets  totaling million at year end  up million from december   with loans of million acquired as part of acquisitions accounting for most of the growth
