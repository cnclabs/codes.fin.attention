overview we are a leading provider of an enterprise reporting application platform  a unified software platform that enables large organizations and packaged application software vendors to develop and deploy self service  customer and employee facing enterprise reporting applications 
enterprise reporting applications are intuitive  web portal like reporting applications that empower of users with decision making information 
our actuate product line provides a platform upon which global organizations companies with annual revenues greater than billion and packaged application software vendors develop and deploy mission critical enterprise reporting applications 
these applications retrieve business information from corporate databases and deliver it as interactive web pages  excel spreadsheets  and analytic cubes to customers  partners and employees around the globe 
our products and services are used by our customers to develop and deploy enterprise reporting applications across a range of business functions including financial management  sales management  account management  and customer self service 
we began shipping our first product in january we sell software products through two primary means i directly to end user customers through our direct sales force and ii through indirect channel partners such as oems  resellers and system integrators 
oems generally integrate our products with their applications and either provide hosting services or resell them with their products 
our other indirect channel partners resell our software products to end user customers 
our revenues are derived from license fees for software products and fees for services relating to such products  including software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
our total revenues for fiscal were million  a decrease over fiscal this overall decrease was primarily a result of lower license revenues  which decreased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal despite the decrease in license revenues  we experienced growth in services revenues  which grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this growth was primarily due to an increase in the installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance and support 
for fiscal year  net loss was million or per share  compared with a net loss of million or per share in fiscal year the loss incurred in was largely a result of million of restructuring costs that we incurred during fiscal year north american total revenues increased slightly during the year from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  while revenues from our international regions decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to date  we have sold our products internationally primarily through our subsidiaries in europe and asia pacific 
during fiscal year  we derived of our total revenues from sales outside of north america while of our total revenues were derived from sales outside north america in fiscal year we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses  thus the prediction of future operating results is difficult and unreliable 
in addition  historical growth rates in our revenues and earnings should not be considered indicative of future revenue or earnings growth rates or operating results 
there can be no assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that we will be able to achieve and maintain profitability on 
table of contents a quarterly or annual basis 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in such event the price of our common stock could decline 
during fiscal year  three trends emerged that had a significant impact on our results of operations 
first  as an enterprise software vendor  we are impacted by the corporate spending environment for information technology it 
during  due to weak global economic conditions  we believe that our customers and prospects decreased their spending for it  which had a negative impact on our business 
we currently believe that corporate it budgets will grow only modestly in second  in we witnessed corporations consolidating their business intelligence software purchases into fewer suppliers 
corporations were reluctant to buy software from new vendors 
this impacted our ability to acquire as many new customers as planned 
if this trend continues it will impact our business in finally  two of our larger competitors  cognos and microstrategy  released products during that are marketed to be directly competitive with our enterprise reporting application platform 
during  the existence of these competitive products required additional sales and marketing efforts to differentiate our products  which resulted in extended sales cycles 
we believe that competition in the enterprise reporting market will be vigorous in acquisitions on july   we acquired of the outstanding stock of nimble technology  inc nimble  a privately held enterprise information integration eii software company 
the results of operations of nimble and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the total purchase price was million  consisting of net cash payment of million  net assumed liabilities of million and acquisition related expenses of  critical accounting policies and estimates general 
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to bad debts  income taxes  restructuring  and litigation 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations 
we follow very specific guidelines in measuring revenues  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
for example  we are required to exercise judgment in evaluating risk of concession when payments terms are beyond the normal credit period ranging between net to days 
further  assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether or not revenues should be recognized in the current market environment 
we also record a small provision for estimated sales returns on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenues could be overstated 
for multiple element arrangements that include software products  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  which is generally the price charged when that element is sold separately 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s accounts receivable is subject to collection risks 
our gross accounts receivable is reserved against this risk through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowance for deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or reduce loss and increase shareholder s equity in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
due to the current economic environment  increased competition  a history of net losses  and our uncertainty in projecting future taxable income  we have determined that we can no longer rely on projections of future taxable income to support the realization of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  as of december   we recorded a million increase to the valuation allowance 
as of december   actuate had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year through if not utilized 
the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year through if not utilized 
as of december  actuate had federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits will expire at various dates beginning in the year through if not utilized 
contingencies 
we are engaged in extraordinary legal actions and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves  if any  may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy for a particular matter 
accrual for restructuring charges 
during the fiscal year ended december  and  we implemented certain restructuring plans that were a combination of a reduction in workforce  exit of idle facilities and the write off of fixed assets 
the restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred in connection with these restructuring plans 
these estimates have been impacted by the rules governing the termination of employees  especially those in foreign countries 
we recorded a facility restructuring charge  which consisted of estimated future obligations for the non cancelable lease payments and estimated costs associated with subleasing the property 
we have reduced the amount of the facility restructuring charge by the estimated amount of sublease income 
the assumptions we have made  which we periodically evaluate and adjust as appropriate  are based on such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublease the property and sublease rates 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly due to such factors as changes in property occupancy rates and the rental prices charged for comparable properties 
these changes could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges for exiting the idle facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined and would be recorded as a credit to restructuring charges 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would be recorded and would have an unfavorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
valuation of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased  technology  customer lists  non compete agreements  experienced workforce and trademark 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if the assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  we will reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to 
table of contents fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal as of december   the net carrying amount of our intangible assets was million 
we evaluate goodwill on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired  we make an assessment of the impairment of the goodwill using the two step method prescribed by sfas any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
we did not record any impairment charges on our goodwill during fiscal as of december   the carrying amount of our goodwill  net was million 
valuation of minority interest in actuate japan 
the minority shareholders of actuate japan have the option to put their equity interest the minority interest in actuate japan and we have the option to call the minority interest for approximately million as of december  our policy is to record a loss  if any  at the time the put or call is probable of being exercised 
should an indicator arise that the minority interest has declined in value below the exercise price of the put and call option  we would conclude that exercise is probable at that point in time and recognize a liability for the intrinsic value of the option 
we periodically perform a valuation analysis of the minority interest 
this valuation analysis includes assumptions regarding projected future cash flows and discount rates 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether a loss is probable and the amount of the loss 
as of december   we concluded that a loss was not probable 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues license fees services total revenues costs and expenses cost of license fees cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of goodwill in and other intangibles purchased in process research and development restructuring charges total costs and expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss 
table of contents revenues our revenues are derived from license fees and services  which include software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
total revenues decreased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and decreased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues for any of the periods presented 
license fees 
revenues from license fees decreased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and decreased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decrease in license fee revenues in fiscal years and was primarily due to continuing weak global economic conditions and a corresponding decrease in the demand for our products 
in addition  we have seen customers engage in vendor consolidation and our competitors have recently released competing products 
these factors have also had an adverse impact on the demand for our products 
license fee revenues recognized in fiscal included an adjustment to reduce revenues in the amount of  to correct the accounting for certain unauthorized side agreements  relating to prior years  identified as part of an investigation conducted by our audit committee 
revenues from license fees from our indirect channel partners  including oems  systems integrators and resellers  accounted for  and of total revenues from license fees for fiscal years  and  respectively 
services 
revenues from services are comprised of maintenance and support  consulting and training 
service revenues increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increases in both fiscal years and were primarily due to an increase in the installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance and support 
costs and expenses cost of license fees 
cost of license fees consists primarily of production costs including printing and packaging  amortization of purchased technologies and localization costs 
cost of license fees increased by from million  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal year to million  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal year cost of license fees increased by from million  or of revenues  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increases in fiscal years and were due primarily to the amortization of purchased technologies from the acquisition of tidestone in mid and nimble in mid we recognized million and  from the amortization of purchased technologies in fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect our cost of license fees as a percentage of revenues from license fees to increase in future periods as a result of a full year of amortization of purchased technology from the nimble acquisition 
cost of services 
cost of services consists primarily of personnel and related costs  facilities costs incurred in providing software maintenance and support  training and consulting services  as well as third party costs incurred in providing training and consulting services 
cost of services decreased by from million or of service revenues  in fiscal year to million  or of services revenues  in fiscal year cost of services decreased by from million  or of services revenues  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of services revenues during fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in on going maintenance and support revenue while maintaining expenses at the prior year s level 
the decreases in cost of services in absolute dollars and as a percentage of services revenues during fiscal year were primarily due to an increase in on going maintenance and support revenues and decreased contracting with third party consultants to support our customers professional service needs 
the savings on decreased contracting with third party consultants were approximately million during fiscal year sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  promotional expenses  travel  entertainment and facility costs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses decreased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly in fiscal due primarily to lower commissions earned on lower revenues  and a 
table of contents reversal in accrued commissions that we recorded in the third quarter of fiscal  of which approximately  was accrued in prior years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decreases in sales and marketing expenses in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal year were primarily due to reduction of sales and marketing personnel  which resulted in reduced compensation and benefits of approximately million  lower sales commissions of approximately million associated with decreased revenues and reduced marketing program expenditures of approximately million 
at the end of fiscal year  we had employees in sales and marketing  compared to and employees at the end of fiscal years and respectively 
we currently expect our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues to be in about the range in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  quality assurance and testing 
research and development expenses increased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year the increases were primarily due to higher rent and facility related charges totaling  as well as a slight increase in salaries and benefits related expenses of approximately  these both resulted from the acquisition of nimble technology in july 
offsetting these increased expenses were lower depreciation expenses of  consulting expenses of approximately  and lower employee relations and other related charges of  in fiscal year research and development expenses decreased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decrease in research and development expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal year was primarily due to reduced headcount in connection with restructuring plans 
at the end of fiscal year  we had employees in research and development compared to and employees at the end of fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in headcount during fiscal year was mainly due to the acquisition of nimble technology  which accounted for additional headcounts 
the increases in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal year and were due to the decline in our total revenues in fiscal years and  as compared to total revenues for the same period in fiscal year we believe that continued investments in technology and product development are essential for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve 
we expect research and development expenses to remain relatively stable in the short term 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for finance  human resources  information systems and general management  as well as legal  bad debts and accounting expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year general and administrative expenses increased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million or of total revenues in fiscal year the slight decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal year was due to declines in depreciation expense of  bad debt expense of  and staffing related expenses of  these decreases were offset by increases in legal and accounting expenses totaling approximately  and property and liability insurance of  in fiscal year the increases in general and administrative expenses in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal year were primarily due to increase in legal fees associated with the microstrategy litigation and an sec inquiry  totaling million  as well as a increase in premiums for our directors and officers insurance policy 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods due primarily to the implementation of a program to ensure compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  establishment of an internal audit program  and implementation of a new enterprise financial software system 
amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
on january   we implemented statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  safs which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
this accounting standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and instead  be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
accordingly  we discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective january  in addition  we reclassified million of acquired workforce  which is no longer defined as acquired intangible assets under sfas  as goodwill 
as a result  no acquired workforce amortization was recognized in fiscal year 
table of contents the provisions of sfas required the completion of a transitional impairment test within six months of adopting the accounting standard  any impairments identified must be treated as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during the quarter ended june   we completed the transitional impairment test  which did not result in an impairment of recorded goodwill 
the provisions of sfas also require an annual impairment test  which we completed on october  and october  neither of these annual impairment tests resulted in an impairment of recorded goodwill 
amortization of goodwill was nil for fiscal years and  as compared to million for fiscal years the decrease in the amortization of goodwill in fiscal years and was due to the adoption of sfas amortization of other intangible assets was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the net decrease in amortization of other purchased intangible assets in fiscal year as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the customer base related to prior acquisitions in europe which were fully amortized by the middle of fiscal year this resulted in a decrease of approximately million offset by increase in the amortization of purchase technology and workforce of  related to the acquisition of nimble technology 
the decrease in amortization of other purchased intangible assets in fiscal as compared to fiscal was a result of the adoption of sfas  which reclassified acquired workforce as goodwill and amortization was no longer required 
we expect the estimated amortization expense of our existing other purchased intangible assets to be approximately million in fiscal restructuring charges 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this form k 
during fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
this charge consisted of a million facility exit charge and million in costs related to the reduction of our worldwide workforce 
the facility exit charge was the result of a long term non cancelable lease agreement that we entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  in anticipation of a projected business expansion 
due to the continuing global economic downturn  the expansion plan did not materialize and the facility had been idle since the commencement of the lease on may  during the third quarter of fiscal year  we decided to exit this facility 
the million facility exit charge consisted of million of estimated future obligations for the non cancelable lease payments net of million of estimated sublease income and estimated costs associated with subleasing the property eg  leasing commissions 
this facility exit charge also included a million write off of property and equipment primarily leasehold improvements as a result of the abandonment of leased facilities 
these charges were based on many factors  including current real estate rates and conditions  anticipated occupancy rates  and forecasted future sublease income 
we could incur additional charges in the future if conditions in the commercial real estate markets were to change significantly 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  are comprised primarily of interest income earned by us on our cash and short term investments 
interest and other income  net  decreased by from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  and decreased by from million in fiscal year to  in fiscal year the decrease in interest and other income  net  in fiscal years and was due to lower interest rates received on our investments 
the decrease in interest and other income  net in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to higher yields on cash and short term investments in fiscal year provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes of million   and million is based on pretax losses of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal year represents primarily federal  state and foreign taxes as adjusted for the impact of operating losses not currently utilized  income tax credits  and the write off of deferred tax assets recognized in the provision for income taxes in fiscal year represents primarily federal  state and foreign taxes as adjusted for the impact of operating losses not currently utilized  income tax credits  and the recognition of additional deferred tax assets 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal year represented primarily federal and state alternative minimum taxes on pretax loss as adjusted for the impact of non deductible goodwill amortization and temporary differences for which deferred tax assets could not be recognized 

table of contents the increase in the provision for income taxes in fiscal compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million increase in in the allowance for deferred tax assets that were initially recognized in we determined that such deferred tax assets were no longer more likely than not to be realized 
the decrease in the provision for income taxes in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the recognition of additional deferred tax assets in fiscal we have determined that  based on a number of factors  only a portion of our total deferred tax assets should be recognized 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
we will continue to assess our ability to realize the tax benefits available to us based on actual and forecasted results 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased from the december  balance noted above from million as of december  our source of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments over the past three years have been primarily generated by our operations 
cash from operating activities 
net cash provided by operations was million during fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  a decrease of million 
cash provided by operations is directly related to the generation of revenues and subsequent collection of invoices 
therefore  our decline in cash generated from operating activities over the past several years is in large part a direct result of our decrease in sales during this time period 
for fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net loss as adjusted by non cash items of amortization and depreciation  a reduction of other current assets  the write off of deferred tax assets  increases in deferred revenue  and decreases in accounts receivable 
accounts receivable decreased due to improved collection efforts from fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the changes noted above were offset by decreases in restructuring liabilities  other accrued liabilities  accounts payable and accrued compensation 
cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  a slight increase of  for fiscal  the following occurred  i net purchases of short term investments totaled million ii cash paid for the acquisition and acquisition expenses of nimble technology totaled million  and iii capital expenditures totaled million 
for fiscal year  the following occurred  i net purchases of short term investments totaled million ii cash paid for the acquisition of open software technology totaled million  and iii capital expenditures totaled million 
actuate s investing activities used net cash of million dollars in fiscal year approximately half of the cash used in investing activities during fiscal year was for the purchase of property and equipment  including the furnishing of the additional office facility located adjacent to our south san francisco headquarters 
the remainder of the cash used in investing activities  net of proceeds from maturity of short term investments  was primarily for the purchases of short term investments 
cash from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year  an increase  net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal for both fiscal years  and  cash provided from financing activities was primarily from the proceeds derived from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option plans  that was offset by the open market repurchases of our common stock 
in fiscal   was used to repay a bank loan assumed in connection with the tidestone acquisition 
the stock was repurchased in accordance with the stock repurchase program the program that was authorized by our board of directors on september   and october  the program allowed us to repurchase up to million of our common stock on the open market 

table of contents year ended december  in thousands  except share data number of shares repurchased cost of share repurchased we believe that our current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may find it necessary to sell additional equity or obtain credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our current stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  including the acquisition of the minority interest in our owned subsidiary in japan  or complementary products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
our future contractual obligations include minimum lease payments under operating leases at december   and are as follows in thousands fiscal year future minimum lease payment future sublease proceeds net future minimum lease payments thereafter in connection with the office building leases in south san francisco  california  we have provided the landlord with a letter of credit in the amount of million as a security deposit 
we have provided security interest in all of our assets as collateral for the letter of credit 
we expect to pay out a deferred compensation balance of  to certain employees within the next twelve months related to the acquisition of nimble technology

table of contents risk factors that may affect future results investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and warnings before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing actuate 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially harmed 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
investors should also refer to the other information set forth in this report on form k  including the financial statements and the notes thereto 
our operating results may be volatile and difficult to predict 
if we fail to meet our estimates of quarterly and annual operating results or we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our stock may decrease significantly 
the susceptibility of our operating results to significant fluctuations makes any prediction  including our estimates  of future operating results unreliable 
in addition  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as indications of our future performance 
our operating results have in the past  and may in the future  vary significantly due to factors such as the following demand for our products  the size and timing of significant orders for our products  a slow down or a decrease in spending on information technology by our current and or prospective customers  the marketing of products by our competitors that are directly competitive with our products  the management  performance and expansion of our international operations  customers desire to consolidate its purchases of business intelligence software to one or a very small number of vendors from which the customer has already purchased software  general domestic and international economic and political conditions  including war and terrorism or the threat of war or terrorism  sales cycles and sales performance of our indirect channel partners  changes in the way we price our products  the existence and the outcome of the appeal of the microstrategy lawsuit  continued successful relationships and the establishment of new relationships with oems  changes in our level of operating expenses and our ability to control costs  the outcome or publicity surrounding any pending or threatened lawsuits  ability to make new products commercially available in a timely manner  budgeting cycles of our customers  
table of contents changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  failure to successfully manage acquisitions made by us  defects in our products and other product quality problems  and failure to successfully meet hiring needs and unexpected personnel changes 
because our software products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received  total revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped throughout that quarter 
furthermore  several factors may require us  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  to defer recognition of license fee revenue for a significant period of time after entering into a license agreement  including whether the license agreement includes both software products that are then currently available and software products or other enhancements that are still under development  whether the license agreement relates entirely or partly to software products that are currently not available  whether the license agreement requires the performance of services that may preclude revenue recognition until successful completion of such services  and whether the license agreement includes acceptance criteria that may preclude revenue recognition prior to customer acceptance 
in addition  we may in the future experience fluctuations in our gross and operating margins due to changes in the mix of our domestic and international revenues  changes in the mix of our direct sales and indirect sales and changes in the mix of license revenues and service revenues  as well as changes in the mix among the indirect channels through which our products are offered 
a significant portion of our total revenues in any given quarter is derived from existing customers 
our ability to achieve future revenue growth  if any  will be substantially dependent upon our ability to increase revenues from license fees and services from existing customers  to expand our customer base and to increase the average size of our orders 
to the extent that such increases do not occur in a timely manner  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
our expense levels and any plans for expansion  including plans to increase our sales and marketing and research and development efforts  are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
if revenues fall below our expectations and we are unable to quickly reduce our spending in response  our business  operating results and financial condition are likely to be harmed 
in addition  we have recently changed the way we price our server products  from cpu pricing to named user pricing 
at this point  we do not know if the change in pricing methodology will impact our ability to sell our products 
based upon all of the factors described above  we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses and it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below our estimates or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in the event that operating results are below our estimates or other expectations  the price of our common stock could decline 
if we fail to grow revenue from international operations and expand our international operations our business would be seriously harmed 
our total revenues derived from sales outside north america were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on 
table of contents our success in increasing revenues from international sales 
we intend to continue to invest significant resources to expand our sales and support operations outside north america and to enter additional international markets 
in order to expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  expand our international channel management and support organizations  hire additional personnel  recruit additional international resellers and increase the productivity of existing international resellers 
if we are not successful in expanding international operations in a timely and cost effective manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
if we do not successfully expand our distribution channels and develop and maintain relationships with oems  our business would be seriously harmed 
to date  we have sold our products principally through our direct sales force  as well as through indirect sales channels  such as our oems  resellers and systems integrators 
our revenues from license fees resulting from sales through indirect channel partners were approximately  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on the success of our sales force in further establishing and maintaining relationships with indirect channel partners 
in particular  a significant element of our strategy is to embed our technology in products offered by oems for resale or as a hosted application to such oem s customers and end users 
we also intend to establish and expand our relationships with systems integrators so that such systems integrators will increasingly recommend our products to their clients 
our future success will depend on the ability of our indirect channel partners to sell and support our products 
if the sales and implementation cycles of our indirect channel partners are lengthy or variable or our oems experience difficulties embedding our technology into their products or we fail to train the sales and customer support personnel of such indirect channel partners in a timely fashion  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
although we are currently investing  and plan to continue to invest  significant resources to expand and develop relationships with oems  we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in establishing and maintaining these relationships 
if we are unable to successfully expand this distribution channel and secure license agreements with additional oems on commercially reasonable terms  including significant up front payments of minimum license fees  and extend existing license agreements with existing oems on commercially reasonable terms  our operating results would be harmed 
any inability by us to maintain existing or establish new relationships with indirect channel partners  including systems integrators and resellers  or  if such efforts are successful  a failure of our revenues to increase correspondingly with expenses incurred in pursuing such relationships  would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
our market is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving standards and recently  new product releases by our competitors that are marketed to compete directly with our products 
furthermore  a number of our competitors have recently completed mergers business objects crystal decisions and hyperion brio 
our competition comes in four principal forms competition from current or future business intelligence software vendors such as business objects  cognos  hyperion  and microstrategy that offer enterprise reporting products  competition from other large software vendors such as microsoft  oracle and sap  to the extent they include reporting functionality with their applications or databases  competition from other software vendors and software development tool vendors  and competition from the it departments of current or potential customers that may develop scalable enterprise reporting applications internally which may be cheaper and more customized than our products 

table of contents most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sales of their products than we may 
also  most current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and the ability to leverage a significant installed customer base 
these companies have released and can continue to release competing enterprise reporting software products or significantly increase the functionality of their existing reporting software products  either of which would result in a loss of market share for us 
we expect additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the enterprise reporting application market and new products and technologies are introduced 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  longer sales cycles and loss of market share  any of which would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing their ability to address the needs of our prospective customers 
also our current or future channel partners may have established in the past  or may in the future  establish cooperative relationships with our current or potential competitors  thereby limiting our ability to sell our products through particular distribution channels 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
such competition could harm our ability to obtain revenues from license fees and services from new or existing customers on terms favorable to us 
if we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
intellectual property claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights 
third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe such parties intellectual property rights 
we expect companies in the business intelligence software market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and or competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if the market for enterprise reporting application software does not grow as we expect  our business would be seriously harmed 
the market for enterprise reporting application software products is still emerging and we cannot be certain that it will continue to grow or that  even if the market does grow  businesses will purchase our products 
if the market for enterprise reporting application software products fails to grow or grows more slowly than we expect  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
to date  all of our revenues have been derived from licenses for our enterprise reporting software and related products and services  and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
we have spent  and intend to continue to spend  considerable resources educating potential customers and indirect channel partners about enterprise reporting applications and our products 
however  if such expenditures do not enable our products to achieve any significant degree of market acceptance  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
because the sales cycles of our products are lengthy and variable  our quarterly results may fluctuate 
the purchase of our products by our end user customers for deployment within the customer s organization typically involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources  and is therefore subject to delays that are beyond our control 
these delays can arise from a customer s internal procedures to approve large capital expenditures  budgetary constraints and the testing and acceptance of new technologies that affect key 
table of contents operations as well as general economic and political events 
the sales cycle for initial orders and larger follow on orders for our products can be lengthy and variable 
recently  we have been experiencing longer sales cycles 
additionally  sales cycles for sales of our products to oems tend to be longer  ranging from to months or more and may involve convincing the vendor s entire organization that our products are the appropriate software for the vendor s application 
this time period does not include the sales and implementation cycles of such vendor s own products  which can be longer than our sales and implementation cycles 
certain of our customers have in the past  or may in the future  experience difficulty completing the initial implementation of our products 
any difficulties or delays in the initial implementation by our end user customers or our indirect channel partners could cause such customers to reject our software or lead to the delay or non receipt of future orders for the large scale deployment of our products 
we may make future acquisitions and acquisitions involve numerous risks our business is highly competitive  and as such  our growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products  introduce new products on a timely basis and expand our distribution channels and professional services organization 
one of the ways we have addressed and will continue to address these issues is through acquisitions of other companies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  negative impact to our financial condition and results of operations resulting from combining the acquired company s financial condition and results of operations with our financial statements  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and we cannot assure you that any acquisition will be successful and will not materially harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
if we do not respond to rapid technological changes  our products could become obsolete and our business could be seriously harmed 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changing customer demands and evolving industry standards 
any of these factors can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to support current and future releases of popular operating systems and computer programming languages  databases and software applications  to timely develop new products that achieve market acceptance and to meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
if the announcement or introduction of new products by us or our competitors or any change in industry standards causes customers to defer or cancel purchases of existing products  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
as a result of the complexities inherent in enterprise reporting applications  major new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
in addition  customers may delay their purchasing decisions in anticipation of the general availability of new or enhanced versions of our products 
as a result  significant delays in the general availability of such new releases or significant problems in the installation or implementation of such new releases could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to successfully develop  on a timely and cost effective basis  product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards or customer requirements or such new products and product enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance  our business  operating results and financial condition may be harmed 

table of contents if we do not release new products and enhancements to existing products in a timely manner or if such new products and enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance  our business could be seriously harmed 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on the success of new products and enhancements to our products that we make generally available 
prior to the release of any new products or enhancements  the products must undergo a long development and testing period 
to date  the development and testing of new products and enhancements have taken longer than expected 
in the event the development and testing of new products and enhancements continue to take longer than expected  the release of new products and enhancements will be delayed 
if we fail to release new products and enhancements in a timely manner  our business  operating results and financial condition may be harmed 
in addition  if such new products and enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business  operating results and financial condition may be harmed 
there are management and operational risks associated with our international operations that could seriously harm our business 
a substantial portion of actuate s revenues is derived from international sales 
international operations are subject to a number of risks  any of which could harm our business  operating results and financial conditions 
these risks include the following economic and political instability  including war and terrorism or the threat of war and terrorism  difficulty in managing an organization spread across many countries  multiple and conflicting tax laws and regulations  costs of localizing products for foreign countries  difficulty in hiring employees in foreign countries  trade laws and business practices favoring local competition  dependence on local vendors  compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing government laws and regulations  longer sales cycles  import and export restrictions and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we believe that  over time  an increasing portion of our revenues and costs will be denominated in foreign currencies 
to the extent such denomination in foreign currencies does occur  gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations 
although we may from time to time undertake foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure  we currently do not attempt to cover any foreign currency exposure 
if we are not successful in any future foreign exchange hedging transactions that we engage in  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

table of contents if microstrategy s appeal is successful  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in june  the fairfax county circuit court in fairfax  virginia  ruled in favor of us and two of our employees on all counts in the trade secret lawsuit filed by microstrategy incorporated 
in july  microstrategy filed a notice of leave to appeal with the circuit court and in september  microstrategy filed a petition for appeal with the virginia state supreme court 
in march  the virginia state supreme court agreed to hear a portion of microstrategy s petition for appeal 
if the virginia state supreme court overturns  in whole or in part  the circuit court s ruling  this could have an adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition and result in the following we could be forced to stop selling our products  we could incur substantial legal costs  we may be required to indemnify our customers  we may have to use significant engineering resources to redesign our products  we may be required to enter into a licensing agreement with microstrategy containing terms that are unfavorable to us  and our customer s decision to purchase our products and services could be negatively impacted 
to manage our business  we need to improve and implement our internal systems  procedures and controls 
if we are unable to do so successfully  our business would be seriously harmed 
in  we intend to implement a new financial accounting software system 
also during  we must document  test and as appropriate modify our internal controls and procedures to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
these projects will put a significant strain on our management  information systems and resources 
failure to successfully complete both of these projects in a timely fashion could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
we believe the scope of our operations has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our management  information systems and resources 
any acquisitions made by us will also put a significant strain on our management  information systems and resources 
in addition  we expect that an expansion of our international operations will lead to increased financial and administrative demands associated with managing our international operations and managing an increasing number of relationships with foreign partners and customers and expanded treasury functions to manage foreign currency risks 
if we fail to manage our business effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business and these officers and key personnel may not remain with us in the future 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key engineering  sales  marketing and customer support personnel 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
if we lose the service of one or more of our key employees  or if one or more of our executive officers or key employees decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

table of contents if our product contains material defects  our business could be seriously harmed 
software products as complex as those offered by us often contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced  when new versions or enhancements are released and when configured to individual customer computing systems 
we currently have known errors and defects in our products 
despite testing conducted by us  if additional defects and errors are found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipment  this could result in the loss of revenues or a delay in market acceptance 
the occurrence of any of these events could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if a successful product liability claim is made against us  our business would be seriously harmed 
although license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that such limitation of liability provisions may not be effective as a result of existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions 
the sale and support of our products may entail the risk of such claims  which are likely to be substantial in light of the use of our products in business critical applications 
a product liability claim brought against us could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate  our business could be seriously harmed 
we have a small number of issued and pending us patents and we rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 
for example  we license our software pursuant to shrink wrap or signed license agreements  which impose certain restrictions on licensees ability to utilize the software 
in addition  we seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property  including requiring those persons with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
if our means of protecting our proprietary rights is not adequate or our competitors independently develop similar technology  our business could be seriously harmed 
our common stock price may be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for stockholders 
the market price of shares of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in the economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad  terrorist attacks  war or the threat of war  the announcement of mergers or acquisitions by us or our competitors  developments in ongoing or threatened litigation  
table of contents announcements of technological innovations  new products or new contracts announced by us or our competitors  developments with respect to copyrights or proprietary rights  price and volume fluctuations in the stock market  changes in corporate purchasing of enterprise reporting application software  failure to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act by december adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  and changes in financial estimates by securities analysts 
in addition  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against such company 
if we are involved in such litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
changes in tax rates or negative tax rulings could adversely impact our financial results 
we are taxable principally in the united states and certain jurisdictions in europe and asia pacific 
all of these jurisdictions have in the past and may in the future make changes to their corporate income tax rates and other income tax laws  which could increase our future income tax provision 
while we believe that all material income tax liabilities are reflected properly in our balance sheet  we have no assurance that we will prevail in all cases in the event the taxing authorities disagree with our interpretations of the tax law 
future levels of research and development spending will impact our entitlement to related tax credits  which generally lower our effective income tax rate 
future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have statutory tax rates lower than in the united states 
certain of our charter provisions and delaware law  may prevent or deter a change in control of actuate 
actuate s certificate of incorporation  as amended and restated the certificate of incorporation  and bylaws  as amended and restated bylaws  contain certain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of actuate or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder might consider favorable  including provisions authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock and eliminating the ability of stockholders to act by written consent 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law and our stock option plans may also have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control or unsolicited acquisition proposals 
the anti takeover effect of these provisions may also have an adverse effect on the public trading price of our common stock 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during fiscal years  and  we derived  and  respectively  of our total revenues from sales outside of north america 
in  less than of the worldwide revenues were denominated in foreign currencies 
our exposure to market risk on these receivables with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies is limited 
however  increases in the value of the us dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country and may result in a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in fiscal year was not material 
actuate does not engage in hedging transactions 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shift in the general level of us interest rates we invest in short term securities that have an average maturity of one year or less 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
