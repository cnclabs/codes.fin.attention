item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements contained herein are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
important factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of those financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements 
judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the company s accounting policies in certain areas 
following are some of the areas requiring significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition  accounts receivable  cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets  estimates of the useful lives of intangible assets and insurance reserves 
there are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
we base our critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and various other estimates we believe to be reasonable 
a description of the aforementioned policies follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue from our products when the products are shipped to our customers and when equipment service is performed for our customers who are charged on a time and material basis 
we also sell equipment service contracts with terms of coverage ranging between and months 
we record deferred income on equipment service contracts which is amortized by the straight line method over the term of the contracts 
we record offsets to revenue for allowances  end user pricing adjustments and trade spending 
off invoice allowances are deducted directly from the amount invoiced to our customer when our products are shipped to the customer 
offsets to revenue for allowances  end user pricing adjustments and trade spending are recorded primarily as a reduction of accounts receivable based on our estimates of liability which are based on customer programs and historical experience 
these offsets to revenue are based primarily on the quantity of product purchased over specific time periods 
for our retail supermarket and frozen beverages segments  we accrue for the liability based on products sold multiplied by per product offsets 
offsets to revenue for our food service segment are calculated in a similar manner for offsets owed to our direct customers  however  because shipments to end users are unknown to us until reported by our direct customers or by the end users  there is a greater degree of uncertainty as to the accuracy of the amounts accrued for end user offsets 
additional uncertainty may occur as customers take deductions when they make payments to us 
this creates complexities because our customers do not always provide reasons for the deductions taken 
additionally  customers may take deductions to which they are not entitled and the length of time customers take deductions to which they are entitled can vary from two weeks to well over a year 
because of the aforementioned uncertainties  the process to determine the amount of liability to record is cumbersome and subject to inaccuracies 
however  we feel that due to constant monitoring of the process  any inaccuracies would not be material 
our recorded liability for allowances  end user pricing adjustments and trade spending was approximately  and  at september  and september   respectively 
the increase in our recorded liability resulted from the acquisition of country home bakers as well as other general increases in allowances throughout our businesses 

back to contents accounts receivable we record accounts receivable at the time revenue is recognized 
bad debt expense is recorded in marketing and administrative expenses 
the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our estimate of the accounts receivable amount that is uncollectable 
it is comprised of a general reserve based on historical experience and amounts for specific customer s accounts receivable balances that we believe are at risk due to our knowledge of facts regarding the customer s 
we continually monitor our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts and adjust it monthly 
we usually have to customers with accounts receivable balances of between million to million 
failure of these customers  and others with lesser balances  to pay us the amounts owed could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of earnings and our consolidated statement of cash flows 
accounts receivable due from any of our customers is subject to risk 
our total bad debt expense was   and  for the fiscal years  and respectively 
at september  and september   our accounts receivables were  and  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and asset impairment we completed documentation of our transitional goodwill impairment tests during the quarter ended march  and did not record any transitional goodwill impairment loss as a result of our adoption of sfas goodwill of our restaurant group reporting unit decreased by  in and goodwill of our frozen beverages reporting unit increased by  in we have three reporting units with goodwill totaling  as of september  we utilize historical reporting unit cash flows defined as reporting unit operating income plus depreciation and amortization as a proxy for expected future reporting cash flows to evaluate the fair value of these reporting units 
if the fair value estimated substantially exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit  including the goodwill  if any  associated with that unit  we do not recognize any impairment loss 
we do not engage a third party to assist in this analysis as we believe that our in house expertise is adequate to perform the analysis 
licenses and rights are being amortized by the straight line method over periods ranging from to years and amortization expense is reflected throughout operating expenses 
the gross carrying amount of intangible assets for the fiscal year ended september  increased by  in primarily as a result of the acquisition of  of intangible assets of country home bakers 
long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangibles  are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
cash flow analyses are used to assess impairment 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  economic conditions  competition and consumer preferences 
insurance reserves we have a self insured medical plan which covers approximately  of our employees 
we record a liability for incurred but not yet paid claims based on our historical experience of claims payments and a calculated lag time period 
we maintain a microsoft excel spreadsheet that includes claims payments made each month according to the date the claim was incurred 
this enables us to have an historical record of claims incurred but not yet paid at any point in the past 
we then compare our accrued liability to the more recent claims incurred but not yet paid amounts and adjust our recorded liability up or down accordingly 
our recorded liability at september  and september  was  and  respectively 
considering that we have stop loss coverage of  for each individual plan subscriber  the general consistency of claims payments and the short time lag  we believe that there is not a material exposure for this liability 
because of the foregoing  we do not engage a third party actuary to assist in this analysis 
we self insure  up to loss limits  worker s compensation and automobile liability claims 
accruals for claims under our self insurance program are recorded on a claims incurred basis 
under this program  the estimated liability for claims incurred but unpaid in fiscal year and was  and  respectively 
our total recorded liability for all years claims incurred but not yet paid was  and  at september  and september   respectively 
we estimate the 
back to contents liability based on total incurred claims and paid claims adjusting for loss development factors which account for the development of open claims over time 
we estimate the amounts we expect to pay for some insurance years by multiplying incurred losses by a loss development factor which is based on insurance industry averages and the age of the incurred claims  our estimated liability is then the difference between the amounts we expect to pay and the amounts we have already paid for those years 
loss development factors that we use range from to 
however  for some years  the estimated liability is the difference between the amounts we have already paid for that year and the maximum we could pay under the program in effect for that particular year because the calculated amount we expect to pay is higher than the maximum 
for other years  where there are few claims open  the estimated liability we record is the amount the insurance company has reserved for those claims 
we evaluate our estimated liability on a continuing basis and adjust it accordingly 
due to the multi year length of these insurance programs  there is exposure to claims coming in lower or higher than anticipated  however  due to constant monitoring and stop loss coverage on individual claims  we believe our exposure is not material 
because of the foregoing  we do not engage a third party actuary to assist in this analysis 
in connection with these self insurance agreements  we customarily enter into letters of credit arrangements with our insurers 
at september  and september   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately  and  respectively

sales of frozen juice bars and ices decreased  or to  in from  in even though case sales of frozen juices and ices were down  sales were down only because of reduced trade spending in compared to we believe that our decline in frozen juices and ices sales was in line with industry wide declines in the frozen novelty product category 
the restaurant group sales of our restaurant group  which operates bavarian pretzel bakery and pretzel gourmet retail stores in the mid atlantic region  declined by  primarily due to reduced mall traffic and closings or licensings of unprofitable stores

frozen beverages frozen beverage and related product sales increased  or to  in fiscal beverage sales alone were essentially unchanged for the year

machine sales increased  to  for the year 
sales to one customer accounted for all of the machine sales increase 
consolidated other than as commented upon above by segment  there are no material specific reasons for the reported sales increases or decreases

back to contents acquisitions  liquidity and capital resources in january  we acquired the assets of country home bakers  inc country home bakers  inc  with its manufacturing facility in atlanta  ga  manufactures and distributes bakery products to the food service and supermarket industries 
its product line includes cookies  biscuits  and frozen doughs sold under the names readi bake  country home and private labels sold through supermarket in store bakeries 
this acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and its operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date 
although there are many factors that could impact our operating cash flow  most notably net earnings  we believe that our future operating cash flow  along with our borrowing capacity  is sufficient to fund future growth and expansion 
based on our past levels of operating cash flow  which has averaged  per year over the past three years  and the strength of our consolidated balance sheet  we believe that we have the capability to borrow in excess of  this is management s current opinion  which could change over time depending on future events 
fluctuations in the value of the mexican peso and the resulting translation of the net assets of our mexican frozen beverage subsidiary caused decreases of   and  in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the  and fiscal years  respectively

 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf addressed various issues related to the income statement classification of certain promotional payments  including consideration from a vendor to a reseller or another party that purchases the vendor s products

other variables which in the past have had a significant impact on our change in cash and cash equivalents are payments for the repurchase of common stock  proceeds from borrowings and payments of long term debt 
as discussed in results of operations  our net earnings may be influenced by many factors 
depreciation and amortization of fixed assets is primarily determined by past purchases of property plant and equipment although it could be impacted by a significant acquisition in the current year 
purchases of property  plant and equipment is primarily determined by our ongoing normal manufacturing and marketing requirements but could be increased significantly for manufacturing expansion requirements or large frozen beverage customer needs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following is the company s quantitative and qualitative analysis of its financial market risk interest rate sensitivity the company has in the past entered into interest rate swaps to limit its exposure to interest rate risk and may continue to do so in the future if the board of directors feels that such non trading purpose is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders 
as of september   the company had no interest rate swap contracts 
interest rate risk at september   the company had no long term debt obligations 
the company s most significant raw material requirements include flour  shortening  corn syrup  chocolate  and macadamia nuts 
the company attempts to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements  generally for periods from to months 
futures contracts are not used in combination with forward purchasing of these raw materials 
the company s procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases  but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases 
foreign exchange rate risk the company has not entered into any forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency rate risk as of september  because it does not believe its foreign exchange exposure is significant
