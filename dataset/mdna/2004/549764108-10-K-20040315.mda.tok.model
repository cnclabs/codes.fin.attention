item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview lufkin industries is a global supplier of oil field  power transmission and trailer products 
through its oil field segment  the company manufactures and services artificial reciprocating rod lift equipment and related products  which are used to extract crude oil and other fluids from wells 
through its power transmission segment  the company manufactures and services high speed and low speed speed increasing and reducing gearboxes for industrial applications 
through its trailer segment  the company manufactures and services various highway trailers  including van  float and dump trailers 
while these markets are price competitive  technological and quality differences can provide product differentiation 
the company s strategy is to differentiate its products through additional value add capabilities examples of these capabilities are high quality engineering  customized designs  rapid manufacturing response to demand through plant capacity  inventory and vertical integration  superior quality and customer service  and an international network of service locations 
in addition  the company s strategy is to maintain a low debt to equity ratio in order to quickly take advantage of growth opportunities and pay dividends even during unfavorable business cycles 
in support of the above strategy  during the third quarter of  the company completed two strategic acquisitions that will expand its oil field segment 
the company purchased the remaining shares of lufkin argentina sa  its argentina joint venture with baker hughes  inc  effective july  lufkin argentina manufactures and services oil field pumping units and automation equipment for use in argentina and other south american countries 
the company also purchased the operating assets of basin technical services in midland  texas on july  this acquisition enhances oil field s product and service offerings in the oil field automation marketplace 
also  during the fourth quarter of  the company completed the acquisition on december   of the operating assets and commercial operations of d r oilfield services located in drayton valley  alberta  canada 
this acquisition within the oilfield segment strengthens the company s presence in canada s oil field service business 
in addition  the company expanded its power transmission capabilities through a new gear repair facility in alabama that will service the southeast us and through new high speed gearbox manufacturing capabilities in its french operation 
the company generally monitors its performance through analysis of sales  gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales and net earnings  as well as debt equity levels  short term debt levels  and cash balances 
overall  sales for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the year ended december   or 
sales for were million 
this growth in was primarily driven by increased sales of new oil field equipment  new van trailers and acquisitions 
the oil field market  though  has not returned to the activity levels seen in additional segment data on sales is provided later in this section 
gross margin for the year ended december   decreased to from for the year ended december   and for year ended december  this overall gross margin decline was due to increased price competition in all segments  the impact of reduced volumes on plant efficiency and utilization and reduced pension income 
additional segment data on gross margin is provided later in this section 
the changes in sales and gross margin primarily drove the changes in net earnings 
the company reported net earnings of million or per share diluted for the year ended december   compared to net earnings of million or per share diluted for the year ended december  net income of million or per share diluted was reported for the year ended december  debt equity long term debt net of current portion as a percentage of total equity levels decreased to at december   from at december  short term debt and the current portion of long term debt was million at december   up slightly from million at december  cash balances at december   were million  down from million at december   due to higher capital expenditures  acquisitions and inventory levels in support of the company s strategies as well as certain volume related working capital requirements 
other events in october  the company experienced a two week work stoppage by its unionized workforce at its primary manufacturing facilities in lufkin  texas 
this work stoppage was related to health care and pension benefit differences during contract negotiations 
while certain shipments were delayed during the fourth quarter of  this work stoppage did not have a significant impact on the overall results of the fourth quarter of in the second quarter of  the company incurred a one time severance expense of  for the lay offs and early retirements of certain employees 
these employee reductions were related to modifying the strategy of the trailer branch facilities to focus primarily on parts from parts and service and other targeted cost reductions in areas not achieving profitability goals 
the oil field segment incurred  power transmission incurred  trailer incurred  and corporate incurred  of this severance expense 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table summarizes the company s sales and gross profit by operating segment in thousands of dollars year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease sales oil field power transmission trailer total gross profit oil field power transmission trailer total oil field sales increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the added sales of the acquisitions and the benefit of the stronger canadian dollar in contributed percentage points of this increase 
the balance of the increase  percentage points  is accounted for by increased sales of new pumping units in the us from higher drilling and production activity associated with higher energy prices and increased sales of automation equipment from new product offerings 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in sales of new pumping units into canada from new drilling activity in canada focusing on shallow wells  which use other forms of artificial lift 
oil field s backlog increased to million as of december   from million at december  this backlog increase was primarily from a million benefit from the argentina acquisition  increased bookings of new pumping units in the us small independent market  increasing deep well drilling activity in canada and foundry machine tool orders from a general improvement in the us industrial markets 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the oil field segment increased to for year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   or percentage points 
this margin improvement was primarily the result of higher utilization of manufacturing facilities and continued cost containment efforts 
this was partially offset by the percentage point impact of reduced pension income  which is discussed at the end of this section  and severance expenses 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for oil field increased to million  or  for year ended december    from million for the for year ended december  the additional expenses of lufkin argentina contributed percentage points of this increase 
sales for the company s power transmission segment increased to million  or  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the benefit of the stronger euro on the sales of the french division contributed percentage points of this increase 
the additional percentage points of growth was the result of increased sales in the french operation  in euros  due to the addition of the high speed product line and increased sales in the us from new high speed units to the oil and gas markets and the gear repair expansion in the southeast us these gains were partially offset by a drop in sales in new low speed units to the rubber market due to capital spending restraints from poor market conditions in the tire industry 
the company s power transmission backlog at december   decreased to million from million at december  this backlog decline was from lower orders of new high speed units in the oil and gas market due to short term project delays and price competition and lower orders in the power generation market from limited capital expansion activity 
gross margin for the power transmission segment decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   or percentage points 
this decline was due to lower margins on new high speed units in the us from several large project orders comprising multiple units  which are typically more competitive and price sensitive and the percentage point impact of reduced pension income and severance expenses 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for power transmission increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  of this increase  the stronger euro contributed percentage points 
the balance of the increase was due to higher third party commissions in the us associated with the above mentioned large project orders  higher engineering expenses in france in support of the new high speed product line and increased selling effort in the gear repair market 
trailer sales for the year ended december   increased to million  or  from million for the year ended december  this growth was negatively impacted by percentage points from the change of strategy  implemented in the second quarter of  of its branch locations to focus primarily on parts sales instead of parts and service 
the percentage point increase in other trailer sales was primarily from increased sales of new vans as higher us freight tonnage has led to more orders from freight haulers and increased sales of floats due to the introduction of a new model 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in sales of dump trailers as orders from the construction market have been weak 
backlog for the trailer segment totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the backlog increase was primarily from floats due to the growth in demand for the new model 
trailer gross margin declined to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   or percentage points this margin decline was due to continued pricing pressure on all models of trailers in the depressed freight hauling market and the percentage point impact of reduced pension income and severance expenses 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for trailer increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   due to an increase in general liability insurance claims 
while insurance claim filings cannot be accurately forecasted  this increase is not expected to recur on an ongoing and regular basis 
corporate administrative expenses  which are allocated to the segments primarily based on sales  increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   primarily due to higher legal expenses associated with the echometer trial in september of and the class action trial in december of investment income  interest expense and other income and expense for the year ended december   totaled million of income compared to income of million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the one time gain of almost  on the sale of the company s twenty year old aircraft  partially offset by lower interest income from lower cash balances 
pension income  which is reported as a reduction of cost of sales  declined to million for the year ended december   or  compared to million for the year ended december  this decline was primarily due to lower expected returns on plan assets due to the lower fair market value of the plan assets 
pension income in is expected to increase to approximately million due to higher fair market value of the plan assets increasing the expected return 
in deriving this forecast  the company reviewed its assumptions for and lowered the discount rate to from  the expected long term return on assets to from and the compensation rate increase to from 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table summarizes the company s sales and gross profit by operating segment in thousands of dollars year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease sales oil field power transmission trailer total gross profit oil field power transmission trailer total oil field sales for the year ended december   decreased to million from million in the year ended december  lower energy prices in the first half of caused declines in oil field drilling and production activity  directly impacting the sale of new pumping units 
the higher energy prices seen in the last half of have not translated into higher activity levels 
drilling activity has not increased with the higher energy prices due to uncertainty over both future global demand levels and the stability of the price of oil 
this was also reflected in the backlog of oil field  which declined to million at december   from million at december  gross profit for oil field decreased to million  or  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   due primarily to the decline in sales of oil field products but also due to a decline in the gross margin 
gross margin decreased to in compared to in due to the product mix shifting towards lower margin commercial castings and fixed production costs increasing as a percentage of revenue 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for oil field decreased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower third party sales commissions and lower legal expenses associated with ongoing and routine litigation 
in certain types of legal expenses previously charged directly to oilfield were charged to corporate 
sales for the company s power transmission segment increased to million  or  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  high speed applications serving the oil and gas  refinery and petrochemical markets increased in with some improvement seen in low speed applications for the sugar and marine markets 
however  demand in the power generation  steel and rubber markets continues to remain weak  contributing to the decline in power transmission backlog to million as of december   compared to million as of december  power transmission gross profit increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this improvement did not match the increase in sales  due to a gross margin decline to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  higher margins on sales of high speed gearboxes and parts were offset by a decline in inter segment revenue to the oil field segment  reducing from million in to a more normal level of million in due to the extraordinary demand for pumping units in oil field in  power transmission produced a large number of gearboxes for oil field 
while these gearboxes were sold near cost to oil field  this incremental volume improved plant utilization and fixed cost absorption of power transmission  improving the overall gross margin 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for power transmission increased slightly to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  trailer sales for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the year ended december   due to some improvement in the freight hauling market 
however  the market remained depressed due to a combination of lower shipping volumes  higher fuel costs  higher personnel costs and higher insurance rates 
the continued depressed state of the market is reflected in the decline in backlog from million at december   to million at december  trailer gross profit and margin improved to million and  respectively  for the year ended december   from and  respectively  for the year ended december  this gross margin improvement was primarily due to two factors cost containment efforts and reduced warranty charges 
labor and overhead costs only increased in compared to versus the revenue increase 
warranty charges were lower due to improved quality efforts and a lower pool of trailers under warranty 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for trailer decreased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower insurance claim expenses 
corporate administrative expenses  which are allocated to the segments primarily based on sales  increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   due to costs associated with the settlement of the labor dispute in the fourth quarter of and higher legal expenses associated with ongoing and routine litigation 
other income and expense for the year ended december   totaled million of income versus million of expense for the year ended december  this improvement was due to higher interest income from invested cash  lower interest expense from reduced debt levels and the non recurrence of losses on asset disposals incurred in pension income  which is reported as a reduction of cost of sales in each segment  decreased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decline was because liabilities of the plan increased while the expected return on assets declined from a reduction in the fair market value 
pension income in is expected to decline to approximately million due to further declines in the fair market value of the assets of the plan lowering the expected return 
in conjunction with these market declines  the company reviewed its assumptions for and lowered the discount rate to from  the expected long term return on assets to from and the compensation rate increase to from

significant components of cash provided by operating activities include net earnings adjusted for non cash expenses of million offset by a net increase in working capital of million 
this increase was primarily due to higher inventory and accounts receivable  which consumed million and million  respectively 
oilfield inventory increased due to planned inventory build in anticipation of higher demand 
accounts receivable increased primarily in oil field and power transmission due to higher revenue volumes and the granting of more extended credit terms to various international customers where longer credit terms are customary 
cash used in investing activities included net capital expenditures totaling million  an increase in other long term assets of million and acquisitions of other companies for million 
capital expenditures in were primarily for additions and replacements of production equipment and operating vehicles in the oil field segment  the expansion into the southeast us for repairing power transmission equipment and the replacement of the company s twenty year old aircraft  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the old plane 
capital expenditures for are projected to be approximately to million 
significant components of cash used in financing activities included proceeds from short term notes payable of million  payments on long term debt of million  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million and dividend payments of million or per share

the company believes that its cash flows from operations and its available borrowing capacity under its credit agreements will be sufficient to fund its operations  including planned capital expenditures  dividend payments and stock repurchases  through december  recently issued accounting pronouncements on april   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities under statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas improves the financial reporting by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly  clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows and amends certain other existing pronouncements for more consistent reporting of contracts that derivatives in their entirety or that contain embedded derivatives that warrant separate accounting 
sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the company has adopted sfas and it did not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
on may   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer to transfer assets or to issue equity shares 
sfas is effective for instruments entered into or modified after may   and pre existing instruments as of the beginning of the first interim period that commences after june  the company has adopted sfas and it did not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued financial interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies and the primary objective is to provide guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights 
fin requires an entity to consolidate a vie if the entity has a variable interest or combination of variable interests that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur or both 
this guidance applies immediately to vies created after january   and to vies in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
however  on october   the fasb decided to grant a broader deferral of the implementation of fin pursuant to this deferral  public companies must complete their evaluations of vies that existed prior to february   and the consolidation of those for which they are the primary beneficiary for financial statements issued for the first period ending after december  for calendar year companies  consolidation of previously existing vies will be required in their december   financial statements 
the company has adopted fin and it did not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revision to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this revision requires additional disclosures to those in the original statement about the assets  obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined postretirement plans 
except for certain items  the provisions of the revised statement were effective for fiscal years ending after december   and the company has adopted these disclosure requirements in this annual report on k 
as is permitted in the revised statement  the company has deferred disclosure of estimated future benefit payments  the disclosure of which is effective for fiscal years ending after june  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated statements 
the company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
an allowance for doubtful accounts has been established to provide for estimated losses on receivable collections 
the balance of this allowance is determined by regular reviews of outstanding receivables and historical experience 
as the financial condition of customers change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
revenue is not recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
the criteria to meet this guideline are persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company also recognizes bill and hold transactions when the product is completed and is ready to be shipped and the risk of loss on the product has been transferred to the customer 
the company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers 
on a routine basis  the company uses estimates in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management s estimates are primarily influenced by market activity levels  production requirements  the physical condition of products and technological innovation 
changes in any of these factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
also  the company accounts for a significant portion of its inventory under the lifo method 
the lifo reserve can be impacted by changes in the lifo layers and by inflation index adjustments 
long lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value can be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows  based on expected future operating results 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value and thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws as well as changes in the financial position of the company could also affect the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
if management estimates that some or all of any deferred tax assets will expire before realization or that the future deductibility is not probable  a valuation allowance would be recorded 
the company is subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its businesses and operations 
the company retains a portion of the insured losses that occur through the use of deductibles 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported insured and non insured claims and legal actions and provides for losses through reserves 
as circumstances develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
the company sells certain of its products to customers with a product warranty that provides repairs at no cost to the customer or the issuance of credit to the customer 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product being sold  but ranges from one year to five years 
the company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical warranty claim costs as a percentage of sales multiplied by prior sales still under warranty at the end of any period 
management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or other information becomes available 
the company offers a defined benefit plan and other benefits upon the retirement of its employees 
assets and liabilities associated with these benefits are calculated by third party actuaries under the rules provided by various accounting standards  with certain estimates provided by management 
these estimates include the discount rate  expected rate of return of assets and the rate of increase of compensation and health claims 
on a regular basis  management reviews these estimates by comparing them to actual experience and those used by other companies 
if a change in an estimate is made  the carrying value of these assets and liabilities may have to be adjusted 
differences in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets within reasonably likely ranges would have had the following impact on results thousands of dollars 
percentage point increase 
percentage point decrease effect of change in discount rate on net periodic benefit cost income effect of change in long term rate of return on plan assets on net periodic benefit cost income forward looking statements and assumptions this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements and information  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  that are based on management s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
when used in this report  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect the company s current views with respect to certain events and are subject to certain assumptions  risks and uncertainties  many of which are outside the control of the company 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  i oil prices  ii capital spending levels of oil producers  iii availability and prices for raw materials  iv currency exchange rate fluctuations in the markets in which the company operates  v changes in the laws  regulations  policies or other activities of governments  agencies and similar organizations where such actions may affect the production  licensing  distribution or sale of the company s products  the cost thereof or applicable tax rates  vi costs related to legal and administrative proceedings  including adverse judgments against the company if the company fails to prevail in reversing such judgments and vii general industry  political and economic conditions in the markets where the company s procures material  components and supplies for the production of the company s principal products or where the company s products are produced  distributed or sold 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  believed  estimated or expected 
the company undertakes no obligations to update or revise its forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  invested funds and debt obligations 
the book value of accounts receivable  short term debt and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their fair market value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
the company believes the carrying values of its long term debt obligations approximate fair values because the interest rates on these obligations are comparable to what the company believes it could currently obtain for debt with similar terms and maturities 
the company s accounts receivable are not concentrated in one customer or industry and are not viewed as an unusual credit risk 
the company does not utilize financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes or to hedge exposures to interest rates  foreign currency rates or commodity prices 
due to the low level of current debt exposure  the company does not have any significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
however  if the company drew on its line of credit with its bank facility  the company would have exposure since the interest rate is variable 
in addition  the company primarily invoices and purchases in the same currency as the functional currency of its operations  which minimizes exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
the company is exposed to currency fluctuations with debt denominated in us dollars owed to the company s us entity by its french and canadian entities 
as of december   this inter company debt was comprised of million euros and million canadian dollars 
also  certain assets and liabilities  primarily employee and tax related  denominated in the local currency of foreign operations whose functional currency is the us dollar are exposed to fluctuations in currency rates
