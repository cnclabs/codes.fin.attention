industry background the conversion of analog to digital technology is creating a revolution in audio and video consumer electronics 
digital technology continues to improve the consumer entertainment experience with such products as large screen televisions  multi featured dvd players  home theater systems  navigational systems  digital still cameras  camera enabled cellular phones  and digital camcorders 
technology advancements have enhanced the clarity  color  sound  functionality and convenience of consumer entertainment products 
in particular  the transition from analog to digital formats has allowed audio and video data to be compressed with little or no perceptible audio and image degradation  improving storage and transmission efficiency 
digital formats provide users with several benefits  including greatly expanded content selection  accelerated transmission of video and audio content  random access to data  superior editing capabilities and enhanced security features such as protection against unauthorized copying 
the television  the telephone and the personal computer pc have emerged as the three principal systems that manage digital entertainment and information 
the television and the pc are the principal devices for viewing and manipulating digital content 
digital set top boxes  dvd players and game consoles connected to televisions are emerging as the principal platforms for viewing and listening to entertainment  while pcs remain the principle platform for storing  and manipulating data and accessing the internet 
the cellular phone is emerging as the principal mobile device for viewing and transmitting digital content 
however  because of size limitations for screens and keypads other mobile devices such as pdas  mpeg audio layer mps players  and portable dvd players also enjoy sizable end markets 
increasing advances in semiconductor technology are allowing digital products to converge  resulting in cost savings and added convenience for consumers 
at the same time  advances in communication allow better distribution of information and entertainment content and provide opportunities for further development of multimedia products 
as digital processing and transmission technology improves  we believe additional entertainment products will continue to be introduced 
some of the more significant digital entertainment products available today include dvd players 
dvd players provide significantly higher quality playback than is possible with vcr or vcd technology through the use of motion picture experts group mpeg and mpeg video decoding and high quality digital audio technologies 
video cd players 
vcd players are music cd players that have been modified to display video on a television and typically sell for less than a low end vcr 
vcd offers quality comparable to vcrs  but is limited to approximately minutes of video information  using an mpeg format standard for compression 
the vcd market is divided into the standard vcd market  and the subsequently developed super vcd svcd market 
vcd is popular in many developing countries while svcd is almost exclusively sold in china 
digital set top boxes stbs 
digital stbs enable subscriber based television through cable  terrestrial broadcast  digital subscriber line  or dsl  and satellite transmissions 
digital video recorders dvrs 
dvrs provide local hard disk memory storage and enable storage and playback of live video streams on a real time basis

table of contents technology in taiwan 
we have internally designed and developed our own test software and purchased certain test equipment  which are provided to our test vendors 
see item  factors that may affect future results our products are manufactured by independent third parties 
competition our markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  price reductions and rapid product obsolescence 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  where the customer evaluates alternative design approaches that require integrated circuits 
because of shortened product life cycles  there are frequent design win competitions for next generation systems 
we expect competition to remain intense from existing competitors and from companies that may enter our existing or future markets 
in general  product prices in the semiconductor industry have decreased over the life of a particular product 
the markets for our products are characterized by intense price competition 
as the markets for our products mature and competition increases  we anticipate that prices for our products will continue to rapidly decline 
our existing and potential competitors consist of medium and large domestic and international companies  many of whom have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  greater intellectual property rights  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we have 
our competitors also include a number of smaller and emerging companies 
our principal competitors in the dvd market include mediatek incorporation mediatek  zoran  sony  panasonic  stmicroelectronic  lsi logic  sunplus and cirrus logic 
in addition  we expect that the dvd platform will face competition from other platforms including stbs  as well as multi function game boxes 
some of our competitors may supply chips for multiple platforms  such as lsi logic and stmicroelectronics  each of which makes chips for both dvd players and stbs 
we also face strong competition from sunplus  a competitor in the vcd market 
our competitors in the digital imaging market include omnivision  as well as other emerging companies 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories as well as greater name recognition than we have 
any of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
in addition  as the market for the dhs develops  a number of companies with significantly greater resources than us could attempt to increase their presence in the market by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors resulting in increased competition to us 
in the past years  lsi logic acquired c cube microsystems  cirrus logic acquired luxsonor semiconductors  oak technology acquired teralogic  and zoran acquired oak technology 
proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights

the information concerning compliance with section of the securities exchange act of is incorporated by reference from the section in the proxy statement for the annual shareholders meeting entitled compliance under section a of the securities exchange act of backlog our products are generally sold pursuant to standard purchase orders  which are often issued only days in advance of shipment and are frequently revised to reflect changes in the customers requirements 
product deliveries are scheduled when we receive purchase orders 
generally  these purchase orders allow customers to reschedule delivery dates and cancel purchase orders without significant penalties 
for these reasons  we believe that our backlog  while useful for scheduling production  is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues 
delays in delivery schedules and or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
as of december   our backlog amounted to approximately million

on september   we filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of california case no 
c against mediatek  a taiwanese company  alleging copyright infringement and unfair competition 
the complaint sought damages and an injunction barring importation into the united states of certain mediatek semiconductor chips alleged to infringe our proprietary intellectual property as well as all downstream products  specifically dvd players  incorporating such mediatek chips 
we believed that mediatek unlawfully acquired and copied our proprietary source code and graphical user interface relating to its dvd products  and then used that technology to target our customers and market mediatek s chips in unfair competition 
simultaneous with the complaint  we filed a motion for expedited discovery to force mediatek to turn over the suspected infringing code for expert analysis in support of a temporary restraining order 
mediatek s source code was produced at the end of december on february   mediatek answered the complaint  asserting affirmative defenses and counterclaims for a declaratory judgment of non infringement and for trade secret misappropriation 
on march   we filed a motion for preliminary injunction against mediatek s manufacture  distribution  and importation of dvd chips  or in the alternative  for an expedited trial on our copyright claims 
we also sought a recall order requiring mediatek to recall all dvd chips from its customers  distributors  retailers  and end users 
following mediation  on june   we entered into a license agreement and mutual release the settlement agreement with mediatek 
under the terms of settlement agreement  both sides have terminated all claims against each other and mediatek received a non exclusive worldwide license to our proprietary dvd user interface and other key dvd software 
under the settlement agreement  mediatek paid us a one time license fee of million related to sales of certain dvd products and is required to pay ongoing royalties with a quarterly cap of million and lifetime cap of million 
the maximum total payments under the settlement agreement are million

with respect to these state court derivative actions  we filed a demurrer to the claims and a motion to stay discovery on march  the demurrer and motion to stay discovery were heard on may  the court denied the demurrer  but issued an order staying discovery pending the resolution of the pleading stage in the district court case 
although we believe that we and our officers and directors have meritorious defenses to both actions and intend to defend these suits vigorously  we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits 
our defense against these lawsuits may be costly and may require a significant commitment of time and resources by our senior management 
management believes that these lawsuits are subject to coverage under our directors and officers liability insurance policies  although to date our carriers have reserved their rights with respect to coverage for these claims 
in the event of a determination adverse to us  either with respect to coverage or with respect to the underlying merits of the lawsuits  we may incur substantial monetary liability  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operation and cash flows

overview we are a leading designer  developer and marketer of highly integrated analog and digital processor chips  imaging sensor chips  digital amplifiers  and camera lens modules 
our digital processor chips are the primary processors driving digital video and audio devices  including dvd  vcd  digital cameras  digital camcorders  consumer digital audio players  and digital media players 
our imaging chips utilize advanced cmos sensor technology to capture an image for digital still cameras and cellular camera phone applications 
our camera lens modules are made up of a lens  image sensor chip  housing and flex cable necessary to provide camera capabilities to electronic devices such as cellular phones and pdas 
our digital amplifiers boost the digital sound to a level required to drive loudspeakers  in such applications as dvd and cd players  home theater systems  audio receivers  boom boxes and televisions sets 
we have also developed encoding processors to address the growing demand for dvrs  recordable dvd players  digital still cameras and digital camcorders 
we believe that multi featured dvd  dvr and recordable dvd players will serve as a platform for the dhs  integrating various digital home entertainment and information delivery products into a single box 
we are also a supplier of chips for use in modems  other communication devices  and pc audio products 
our chips use multiple processors and a programmable architecture that enable us to offer a broad array of features and

we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue 
in addition  substantially all of our products are manufactured  assembled and tested by independent third parties in asia 
we also have a limited number of employees engaged in research and development efforts outside of the united states

critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition inventories and inventory reserves goodwill and other intangible assets impairment of long lived assets income taxes legal contingencies in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also cases in which management s judgment is required in selecting appropriate accounting treatment among available alternatives under gaap 
our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is primarily generated by product sales and is generally recognized at the time of shipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  except for products sold to certain distributors with certain rights of return and allowance  in which case  revenue is deferred until such distributor resells the products to a third party 
such deferred revenues related to distributor sales  net of deferred cost of goods sold are included in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets 
we provide for rebates based on current contractual terms and future returns based on historical experiences at the time revenue is recognized as reductions to product revenue 
actual amounts may be different from management s estimates 
such differences  if any  are recorded in the period they become known 
income from mediatek royalties for the sale of products utilizing licensed technology is reported as revenue based on the number of units sold as reported to us by mediatek 
inventories and inventory reserves our inventory is comprised of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  all of which are manufactured by third party contractors 
inventory is valued at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we reduce the carrying value of inventory for estimated slow moving  excess  obsolete  damaged or otherwise unmarketable products by an amount that is the difference between cost and estimated market value based on forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
we evaluate excess or obsolete inventory primarily by estimating demand for individual products within specific time horizons  typically one year or less 
we generally provide a reserve for the cost of products with on hand and committed quantities in excess of the estimated demand after considering factors such as product life cycles 
once established  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory are only released when the reserved products are scrapped or sold 
we also evaluate the carrying value of inventory at the lower of standard cost or market on an individual product basis  and these evaluations are based on the difference between net realizable value and standard cost 
net realizable value is the forecasted selling price of the product less the estimated costs of completion and disposal 
when necessary  we reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value 
the estimates of future demand  forecasted sales prices and market conditions used in the valuation of inventory form the basis for our published and internal revenue forecast 
if actual results are substantially lower than the forecast  we may be required to record additional write downs of product inventory in future periods and this may have a negative impact on gross margins 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which addresses the accounting that must be applied to goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and instead  be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually 
we completed an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
we have goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions of netridium communications  inc netridium in  silicon analog systems sas in  and pictos and divio in in accordance with sfas  we reclassified acquired workforce intangible assets  which were previously recognized apart from goodwill  as goodwill and ceased amortization of goodwill as of january  
table of contents impairment of long lived assets pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review the recoverability of our long lived assets based upon our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the long lived assets and will reserve for impairment whenever such estimated future cash flows indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of timing differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
us deferred income taxes are not provided on all un remitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are considered permanently invested 
assumptions underlying recognition of deferred tax assets and non recognition of us income tax on un remitted earnings can change if our business plan is not achieved or if congress adopts changes in the internal revenue code of  as amended 
legal contingencies from time to time  we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of patents  trademarks  copyrights and other intellectual property rights and other claims arising out of the ordinary course of business 
further  we are currently engaged in certain shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits 
these contingencies require management judgment in order to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new vies created or acquired after january  for arrangements entered into with vies created prior to february   the provisions of fin were originally effective as of july   however  the fasb subsequently delayed the effective date of this provision until the first interim or annual period ending after december  in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin to address certain implementation issues 
the adoption of fin and revised fin did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  sab which supersedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked question and answers issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents results of operations our consolidated financial information presents the net effect of the discontinued operation separately from the results of our continuing operations

percentage of net revenues for years ended december  dvd vcd digital imaging recordable consumer digital media communication and other pc audio total 
table of contents dvd revenue includes revenue from sales of dvd decoder chips 
dvd revenues were million in  a decrease of million  or  from to  primarily due to lower unit sales and lower average selling price asp per unit 
unit sales decreased by and asp per unit decreased by 
we believe this decrease resulted from the entry in the third quarter of of mediatek  a then new competitor based in taiwan  who introduced to the marketplace a dvd chip that we believed infringed our intellectual property rights 
we filed a lawsuit in the united states against mediatek requesting both damages and an injunction to stop the importation into the united states of dvd players containing products we believe infringed our intellectual property rights 
on june   we entered into the settlement agreement with mediatek relating to the lawsuit we had filed relating to this activity 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  both sides terminated all claims against each other and mediatek received a non exclusive worldwide license of our proprietary dvd user interface and other key dvd software 
in conjunction with the settlement agreement  mediatek paid us a one time license fee of million related to sales of certain dvd products and is required to pay ongoing royalties with a quarterly cap of million and lifetime cap of million 
despite the settlement agreement  we believe that we have lost market share among some china based oems 
we sold approximately million units of our dvd chip products in as compared to approximately million units sold in vcd revenue includes revenue from sales of vcd and svcd chips 
vcd revenues were million in  a decrease of million  or  from to  primarily due to lower asp per unit 
asp per unit decreased by while unit sales increased by 
the changes were primarily due to the change in the product mix of the vcd group from to beginning in  the vcd chipsets were being phased out and replaced by visba integrated chips 
as a result  unit sales of the visba increased significantly while the unit sales of the vcd chipsets declined 
however  asp per unit of the visba was lower than the asp per unit of the vcd chipsets 
therefore  the overall asp per unit dropped 
we sold approximately million units of our vcd chip products in as compared to approximately million units sold in we continue to target the market for this product line by lowering our product costs 
digital imaging revenue includes revenue from sales of image sensor chips and image processor chips 
digital imaging revenues were million in and in digital imaging revenues derived from the sale of products of pictos  a company that we acquired in june we sold approximately million units of digital imaging chip products in recordable revenue includes revenue from sales of integrated encoder and decoder chips  and encoder and decoder chips sold together as a chipset 
recordable revenues were million in and in the revenue of the encoding products of divio  which we acquired in august  was approximately of the total recordable revenues 
we sold approximately million units of recordable chip products in consumer digital media revenue includes revenue from sales of consumer digital media chips 
consumer digital media revenues were million in  an increase of million  or from to  primarily due to higher unit sales 
the consumer digital media products were introduced during the fourth quarter of the revenue of million was classified as communication and other revenue in we sold approximately million units of consumer digital media chip products in as compared to less than million units sold in communication and other revenues were million in  a decrease of million  or  from to  primarily due to lower unit sales and lower asp per unit 
unit sales decreased by and asp per unit decreased by  from to we are no longer emphasizing this product line  which is a mature market characterized by unit price declines 
we sold approximately million units of communication and other chip products in as compared to approximately million units sold in pc audio revenues were million  a decrease of million in  or  from to  primarily due to lower unit sales 
unit sales decreased by from to we are no longer emphasizing this product line  which is a declining market as this technology is being incorporated into the pc s central processor chip 
we sold approximately million units of pc audio chip products in as compared to approximately million units sold in 
table of contents international revenues accounted for approximately of net revenues in both and our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
we expect that international sales will continue to remain a high percentage of our net revenues in the future 
gross margin gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross margins were in and in the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower volume in our dvd business in  and a higher volume of lower margin vcd and digital imaging products  partially offset by a net decrease in the provision for excess and obsolete inventories of approximately million  and million of mediatek royalty revenue at gross margin 
excess and obsolete reserves released during the twelve months ended december  amounted to million  compared to million of reserves provided during the twelve months ended december  the released reserves were a result of the sale of products that had previously been fully reserved 
as a result of intense competition in our markets  we expect the overall asp per unit for our existing products to decline their product lives  and in overall gross margins may continue to shrink 
we believe that in order to maintain or increase gross profit in  we must achieve higher unit volume in shipments  reduce costs  add new features as well as introduce new products at higher asp 
research and development research and development expenses were million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues in research and development expenses increased by million  or  from to  primarily due to the research and development expenses of pictos of million and divio of million  which we acquired in june and august  respectively

the selling  general and administrative expenses in included the amortization of intangibles of million and million for pictos and divio respectively 
in  the amortization of intangibles is estimated to be million and million for pictos and divio respectively 
non operating income  net net non operating income was million in and million in in  net non operating income consisted primarily of net license income of million from mediatek settlement  interest income of million and rental income of million from vialta  partially offset by the million write off of investment in broadmedia and a million fee paid to mediatek for the successful application for exemption from the taiwan withholding tax on the million of license income from mediatek

provision for benefit from income taxes our effective tax rate was for compared to a effective tax rate for the primary reason for the increase in our effective tax rate for was an accrual of income taxes for the mediatek license fee and royalty payments 
our tax rate for was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate of primarily as a result of a release of tax reserves related to the expiration of the statute of limitations on our return offset in part by nondeductible expenses 
our tax rate for was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate primarily as a result of the lower foreign tax rate on earnings from our foreign subsidiary  which were considered to be permanently reinvested  and tax credits

net income loss net income was million in and million in net income decreased by million from to  primarily due to lower sales  lower gross margin and higher operating expense  partially offset by the license income from mediatek 
comparison of twelve months ended december  and december  net revenues net revenues were million in and million in net revenues increased by million  or  from to primarily due to the growth of our dvd business  partially offset by the decrease in the asp of our vcd chips and the decline in revenues of our pc audio and communication products 
the following table summarizes revenues by our major product categories percentage of net revenues for years ended december  dvd vcd communication and other pc audio total dvd revenue includes revenue from sales of dvd decoder chips 
dvd revenues were million  an increase of million  or  from to  primarily due to higher unit sales  partially offset by lower asp per unit 
while unit sales increased by  asp per unit decreased by from to 
table of contents although unit sales in were higher than in  unit sales in the third and fourth quarter of were lower than expected 
we believe this decrease resulted from the entry in the third quarter of of mediatek  a then new competitor based in taiwan  who introduced to the marketplace a dvd chip that we believed infringed our intellectual property rights 
we filed a lawsuit in the united states against mediatek requesting both damages and an injunction to stop the importation into the united states of dvd players containing products we believed infringed our intellectual property rights 
on june   we entered into the settlement agreement with mediatek relating to the lawsuit we had filed related to this activity 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  both sides terminated all claims against each other and mediatek received a non exclusive worldwide license of our proprietary dvd user interface and other key dvd software 
mediatek then paid us a one time license fee of million related to sales of certain dvd products and would is required to pay ongoing royalties with a quarterly cap of million and lifetime cap of million 
despite the settlement agreement  we believe that we have lost market share among some china based oems 
we sold approximately million units of our dvd chip products in vcd revenues were million  a decrease of million  or  from to  primarily due to a decrease in the asp per unit  partially offset by an increase in unit sales

unit sales decreased by  from to  as we are no longer emphasizing this product line  which is a declining market as this technology is being incorporated into the pc s central processor chip 
we sold approximately million units of our pc audio chip products in international revenues accounted for approximately of net revenues in and of net revenues in our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
we expect that international sales will continue to remain a high percentage of our net revenues 
gross margin gross profit increased to million in from million in gross margins were in and in the increase in gross margin was primarily due to the growth of our dvd business in  substantially offset by reduced sales and profitability of our other product categories 
although gross profit and margins increased in as compared to the preceding year  in the third quarter of  we began experiencing increasing competition and pricing pressures for both our dvd and vcd products 
as a result  overall gross margins of over reported in the first and second quarters of decreased to in the fourth quarter 
we expect that gross margins will remain significantly below the levels experienced in the fiscal year at least until such time as new products  with higher asps are introduced  achieve market acceptance  and are sold in volume 
as a result of intense competition in our markets  we expect the overall asp per unit for our existing products to decline over their product lives 
we believe that in order to maintain or increase gross profit  we must achieve higher unit volume in shipments  reduce costs  add new features and introduce new products 
research and development research and development expenses were million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in research and development expenses decreased by million  or  from to  primarily due to the decrease in amortization expenses of

to date  we have not declared or paid cash dividends to our shareholders and do not anticipate paying any dividend in the foreseeable future due to a number of factors  including the volatile nature of the semiconductor industry and the potential requirement to finance working capital in the event of a significant upturn in business

factors that may affect future results our business is highly dependent on the expansion of the consumer electronics market 
since the second half of  we have shifted our primary focus from the pc audio business to developing products primarily for the consumer electronics market  including the consumer digital home entertainment market 
currently  our sales of video system processor chips to the dvd and vcd including vcd and svcd player markets account for a majority of our net revenues 
we expect these products will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
further  we continue to invest in new product lines such as our digital imaging products that target the consumer electronics market 
however  our strategy in this market may not be successful 
given the current economic environment and other consumer electronics products  consumer spending on dvd players and other home electronics may not increase as expected or may even weaken or fall 
if the markets for these products and applications decline or fail to develop as expected  or we are not successful in our efforts to market and sell our products to manufacturers who incorporate integrated circuits into these products  our financial results will be harmed 
in addition  the potential decline in consumer confidence and consumer spending that may be occasioned by terrorist attacks or armed conflict could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations that may cause volatility or a decline in the price of our stock 
historically  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly 
our future quarterly operating results will likely fluctuate from time to time and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and 
table of contents investors in a particular future period 
the price of our common stock could decline due to such fluctuations 
the following factors may cause significant fluctuations in our future quarterly operating results changes in demand for our products  changes in the mix of products sold and our revenue mix  charges related to excess inventory  charges related the net realizable value of inventory  seasonal customer demand  increasing pricing pressures and resulting reduction in the asp of any or all of our products  gain or loss of significant customers  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the timing of our and our competitors new product announcements and introductions and the market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our and our customers products  the timing of significant customer orders  most of our orders are on a turns basis  which makes back log a poor indicator of the next quarter s revenue  orders are normally received with little lead time for customer deliveries  which makes it difficult to predict sales until the end of the quarter  availability and cost of raw materials  significant increases in expenses associated with the expansion of operations  availability and cost of foundry capacity  a shift in manufacturing of consumer electronic products away from china  and loss of key employees which could impact sales or the pace of product development 
in addition  sales for any future quarter may vary and accordingly be inconsistent with our plans 
we manufacture products based on a combination of limited  firm order requirements and forecasts of our customer demands 
products are typically shipped within one to eight weeks following receipt of an order 
customers may cancel or reschedule orders without significant penalty 
product sales are also difficult to forecast because the consumer electronics market is rapidly evolving and our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in one or more future quarters  our results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 
we often purchase inventory based on sales forecasts and if anticipated sales do not materialize  we may continue to experience significant inventory charges 
we currently place non cancelable orders to purchase our products from independent foundries on an approximately three month rolling basis  while our customers generally place purchase orders frequently with short lead times with us that may be cancelled without significant penalty 
if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter are cancelled or do not occur as quickly as expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and we may be required to record significant inventory charges in our statement of operations in a particular period 
as our business grows  we may increasingly rely on distributors  which may further impede our ability to accurately forecast product orders 
we have experienced significant inventory charges in the past and we may continue to experience these charges in future periods 

table of contents our research and development investments may fail to enhance our competitive position 
we invest a significant amount of time and resources in our research and development activities to maintain and enhance our competitive position 
technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and the commitment of extensive engineering resources 
we incur substantial research and development costs to confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product that in the end may not be successful 
if we are not able to successfully complete our research and development projects on a timely basis  we may face competitive disadvantages 
there is no assurance that we will recover the development costs associated with these projects or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future research and development efforts 
one of our significant projects is the development of a next generation dvd processor chip that will incorporate three independent processors and allow us to support additional features  including the linux  pocketpc formerly wince and vxworks operating systems 
this will require a new architecture and a complete system on a chip design  which is extremely complex and may not be ultimately feasible 
if we are unable to successfully develop this next generation dvd processor chip  or complete other significant research and development projects  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may need to acquire other companies or technologies to successfully compete in our industry and we may not be successful acquiring key targets or integrating these acquisitions with our business 
we will continue to regularly consider the acquisition of other companies or the products and technologies of other companies to complement our existing product offerings  improve our market coverage and enhance our technological capabilities 
there may be technologies that we need to acquire or license in order to remain competitive 
however  we may not be able to identify and consummate suitable acquisitions and investments or be able to acquire them at costs that are competitive 
acquisitions and investments carry risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including the failure to integrate with existing products and corporate culture  the inability to retain key employees from the acquired company  diversion of management attention from other business concerns  the potential for large write offs  the failure of the acquired products or technology to attain market acceptance  the failure to leverage the acquired products and technology to attain market acceptance  issuances of equity securities dilutive to our existing shareholders  the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities  and our ability to properly access and maintain an effective internal control environment over an acquired company  in order to comply with the recently adopted and pending public reporting requirements 
our sales may fluctuate due to seasonality and changes in customer demand 
since we are primarily focused on the consumer electronics market  we are likely to be affected both by changes in consumer demand and by seasonality in the sales of our products 
historically  over half of consumer electronic products are sold during the holiday seasons 
consumer electronic product sales have historically been much higher during the holiday shopping season than during other times of the year  although the manufacturers shipments vary from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including retail levels and retail promotional activities 
in addition  consumer demand often varies from one product to another in consecutive holiday seasons  and is strongly influenced by the overall state of the economy 
because the consumer electronic market experiences substantial seasonal fluctuations  seasonal 
table of contents trends may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly and our inability to forecast these trends may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in  for example  we did not experience as much of a seasonal demand for our dvd chips as we expected 
we believe that this was due in part to the entry of a new competitor  but also in part to lower than expected consumer demand for dvd players  which experienced strong sales during the holiday seasons 
in the future  if the market for our products is not as strong during the holiday seasons  whether as a result of changes in consumer tastes or because of an overall reduction in consumer demand due to economic conditions  we may fail to meet expectation of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to fall 
our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures 
the markets for most of the applications for our chips are characterized by intense price competition 
the willingness of oems to design our chips into their products depends  to a significant extent  upon our ability to sell our products at cost effective prices 
we expect the asp of our existing products particularly our dvd decoder chip products to decline significantly over their product lives as the markets for our products mature  new products or technology emerges and competition increases 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in product prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher margins  our gross margins may decline 
we may lose business to competitors who have significant competitive advantages 
our existing and potential competitors consist  in part  of large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  greater intellectual property rights  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we have 
our competitors also include a number of independent and emerging companies who may be able to better adapt to changing market conditions and customer demand 
in addition  some of our current and potential competitors maintain their own semiconductor fabrication facilities and could benefit from certain capacity  cost and technical advantages 
we expect that market experience to date and the predicted growth of the market will continue to attract and motivate more and stronger competitors 
dvd and vcd players face significant competition from video on demand  vcrs and other video formats 
in addition  we expect that the dvd platform for the dhs will face competition from other platforms including stbs  as well as multi function game boxes being manufactured and sold by large companies 
some of our competitors may be more diversified than us and supply chips for multiple platforms 
a decline in dvd sales may have a disproportionate effect on us as it is currently our most important product line 
any of these competitive factors could reduce our sales and market share and may force us to lower our prices  adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is dependent upon retaining key personnel and attracting new employees 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of fred sl chan  our chairman of the board  and robert l 
blair  our president and ceo 
in the past  mr 
chan has served as our president and chief executive officer in addition to being our chairman of the board 
mr 
chan is critical to maintaining many of our key relationships with customers  suppliers and foundries in asia 
the loss of the services of mr 
chan  mr 
blair  or any of our other key executives could adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to retain these key personnel and searching for their replacements could divert the attention of other senior management and increase our operating expenses 
we currently do not maintain any key person life insurance 
additionally  to manage our future operations effectively  we will need to hire and retain additional management personnel  design personnel and software engineers 
we may have difficulty recruiting these employees or integrating them into our business 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly design personnel and software engineers  could make it difficult to implement our key business strategies  such as timely and effective product introductions 

table of contents we rely on a single distributor for a significant portion of our revenues and if this relationship deteriorates our financial results could be adversely affected 
sales through our largest distributor dynax electronics a hong kong based company were approximately  and of our net revenues in  and dynax electronics is not subject to any minimum purchase requirements and can discontinue marketing any of our products at any time 
in addition  dynax electronics has rights of return for unsold product and rights to pricing allowances to compensate for rapid  unexpected price changes  therefore we do not recognize revenue until dynax electronics sells through to our end customers 
if our relationship with dynax electronics deteriorates  our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly as we experience short term disruption to our sales and collection processes  particularly in light of the fact that we maintain significant accounts receivable from dynax electronics 
as our business grows  we may increasingly rely on distributors  which may reduce our exposure to future sales opportunities 
although we believe that we could replace dynax electronics as our distributor for the hong kong and china markets  there can be no assurance that we could replace dynax electronics in a timely manner or if a replacement were found that the new distributor would be as effective as dynax electronics in generating revenue for us 
our customer base is highly concentrated  so the loss of a major customer could adversely affect our business 
a substantial portion of our net revenues has been derived from sales to a small number of our customers 
during  sales to our top five end customers including end customers that buy our products from our largest distributor dynax electronics were approximately of our net revenues 
we expect this concentration of sales to continue along with other changes in the composition of our customer base 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers or the loss of one or more major customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more key customers could harm our financial condition 
we may continue to expand into new businesses and product lines in which there may be a concentrated customer base and for which we may be required to purchase custom inventory to meet our customers needs 
we have in the past and will continue to regularly consider the expansion into new businesses and product lines  by acquisition or otherwise 
as a result of our prior expansions into new businesses and new product lines  we continue to sell our products to a highly concentrated customer base 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers or the loss of one or more major customers in these new businesses or product lines  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of our recent acquisitions  such as pictos  we currently purchase custom inventory from certain of our product lines such as image sensor modules for camera enabled cellular phones 
this custom inventory is highly tailored to each customer s specifications 
in the event that these customers reduce or cancel their orders for these products  we may not be able to re sell the custom inventory to any of our other customers 
we may also be forced to write off such custom inventory which may result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use and we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
to protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures 
as of december   we had patents granted in the united states 
these patents will expire over time commencing in and ending in in addition  as of december   we had corresponding foreign patents  which are going to expire over time commencing in and ending in we cannot assure you that patents will be issued from any of our 
table of contents pending applications or applications in preparation or that any claims allowed from pending applications or applications in preparation will be of sufficient scope or strength 
we may not be able to obtain patent protection in all countries where our products can be sold 
also  our competitors may be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken to protect our intellectual property will adequately prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions 
litigation by or against us could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a favorable determination for us 
any claim  even if without merit  may require us to spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or cross licensing arrangements  which may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
we may be required to pay substantial damages or cease the use and sale of infringing products  or both 
in general  a successful claim of infringement against us in connection with the use of our technologies could adversely affect our business 
for example  if we lose the townshend modem case  our results of operations could be significantly harmed 
we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation our business could be materially harmed 
we have significant international sales and operations that are subject to the special risks of doing business outside the united states 
substantially all of our sales are to customers in hong kong  taiwan  china  korea  japan and the czech republic 
during  sales to customers in hong kong  taiwan and china were in excess of of our net revenues 
if our sales in one of these countries  such as hong kong  were to fall  our financial condition could be materially impaired 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenues 
in addition  substantially all of our products are manufactured  assembled and tested by independent third parties in asia 
there are special risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states  including unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements and related compliance problems  political  social and economic instability  lack of adequate protection of our intellectual property rights  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  including changes in most favored nations trading status  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles and greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse tax consequences  including withholding in connection with the repatriation of earnings and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  difficulties in obtaining export licenses for technologies  language and other cultural differences  which may inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our us and foreign counterparts  and currency exchange risks 
our products are manufactured by independent third parties 
we rely on independent foundries to manufacture all of our products 
substantially all of our products are currently manufactured by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  ltd  united microelectronics 
table of contents corporation and other independent asian foundries in asia 
our reliance on these or other independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the possibility of an interruption or loss of manufacturing capacity  reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs  and the inability to reduce our costs as rapidly as competitors who perform their own manufacturing and who are not bound by volume commitments to subcontractors at fixed prices 
any failure of these third party foundries to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers and harm our sales and financial results 
to address potential foundry capacity constraints in the future  we may be required to enter into arrangements  including equity investments in or loans to independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  joint ventures to own and operate foundries  or take or pay contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
these arrangements could require us to commit substantial capital or to grant licenses to our technology 
if we need to commit substantial capital  we may need to obtain additional debt or equity financing  which could result in dilution to our shareholders 
because we are dependent upon a limited number of suppliers  we could experience delivery disruptions or unexpected product cost increases 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers to obtain adequate supplies of quality raw materials on a timely basis 
we do not generally have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
if we have difficulty in obtaining materials in the future  alternative suppliers may not be available  or if available  these suppliers may not provide materials in a timely manner or on favorable terms 
if we cannot obtain adequate materials for the manufacture of our products  we may be forced to pay higher prices  experience delays and our relationships with our customers may suffer 
in addition  we license certain technology from third parties that is incorporated into many of our key products 
if we are unable to obtain or license the technology on commercially reasonable terms and on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver products to our customers on competitive terms and in a timely manner and our relationships with our customers may suffer 
we have extended sales cycles  which increase our costs in obtaining orders and reduce the predictability of our earnings 
our potential customers often spend a significant amount of time to evaluate  test and integrate our products 
our sales cycles often last for several months and may last for up to a year or more 
these longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources prior to the generation of revenues and subject us to greater risk that customers may not order our products as anticipated 
in addition  orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of customers purchase decisions 
any cancellation or delay in ordering our products after a lengthy sales cycle could adversely affect our business 
our products are subject to recall risks 
the greater integration of functions and complexity of our products increase the risk that our customers or end users could discover latent defects or subtle faults in our products 
these discoveries could occur after substantial volumes of product have been shipped  which could result in material recalls and replacement costs 
product recalls could also divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development needs and could adversely impact our customer relationships 
in addition  we could be subject to product liability claims that could distract management  increase costs and delay the introduction of new products 

table of contents the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand  the timing  length and volatility of which are difficult to predict 
downturns in the industry have been characterized by abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of asp 
upturns in the industry have been characterized by rising costs of goods sold and lack of production capacity at our suppliers 
these cyclical changes in demand and capacity  upward and downward  could significantly harm our business 
our quarterly net revenue and gross margin performance could be significantly impacted by these cyclical variations 
a prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that the market will improve from a cyclical downturn or that cyclical performance will stabilize or improve 
we may need additional funds to execute our business plan  and if we are unable to obtain such funds  we may not be able to expand our business  and if we do raise such funds  your ownership in ess may be subject to dilution 
we may be required to obtain substantial additional capital to finance our future growth  fund our ongoing research and development activities and acquire new technologies or companies 
to the extent that our existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations are insufficient to fund our activities  we may need to seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time 
if our performance or prospects decrease  we may need to consummate a private placement or public offering of our capital stock at a lower price than you paid for your shares 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance of new securities at a lower price than you paid for your shares  you will be subject to additional dilution 
further  such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us when needed or  if available  it may not be available on terms favorable to us 
our success within the semiconductor industry depends upon our ability to develop new products in response to rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards and product obsolescence 
our success is highly dependent upon the successful development and timely introduction of new products at competitive prices and performance levels 
the success of new products depends on a number of factors  including anticipation of market trends  timely completion of product development  design and testing  market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers  offering new products at competitive prices  meeting performance  quality and functionality requirements of customers and oems  and meeting the timing  volume and price requirements of customers and oems 
our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards  however we have no control of future modifications to these standards 
manufacturers may not continue to follow the current standards  which would make our products less desirable to manufacturers and reduce our sales 
our success is highly dependent upon our ability to develop new products in response to these changing industry standards 
we operate in highly competitive markets 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological changes  price reductions and short product life cycles 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  when customers evaluate alternative design approaches requiring integrated circuits 
because of short product life cycles  there are frequent design win competitions for next generation systems 

table of contents we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with products that may be provided at lower costs or provide higher levels of integration  higher performance or additional features 
advancements in technology can change the competitive environment in ways that may be adverse to us 
for example  today s high performance central processing units in pcs have enough excess computing capacity to perform many of the functions that formerly required a separate chip set  which has reduced demand for our pc audio chips 
the announcements and commercial shipments of competitive products could adversely affect sales of our products and may result in increased price competition that would adversely affect the asp and margins of our products 
the following factors may affect our ability to compete in our highly competitive markets the timely shipment of our new vcd chip  the visba iv  the price  quality and performance of our products and the products of our competitors  the timing and success of our new product introductions and those of our customers and competitors  the emergence of new multimedia standards  the development of technical innovations  the ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity and sources of raw materials  the rate at which our customers integrate our products into their products  the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  and the protection of our intellectual property rights 
the value of our common stock may be adversely affected by market volatility 
the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly 
many factors influence the price of our common stock  including future announcements concerning us  our competitors or our principal customers  such as quarterly operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations  or litigation  the liquidity within the market for our common stock  sales by our officers  directors  other insiders and large shareholders  investor perceptions concerning the prospects of our business and the semiconductor industry  market conditions and investor sentiment affecting market prices of equity securities of high technology companies  and general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions or international currency fluctuations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes which may lead to changes in the market values of our investments 
foreign exchange risks we fund our operations with cash generated by operations  the sale of marketable securities and short and long term debt 
as we operate primarily in asia  we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  which could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  our product sales and all of our arrangements with our foundries 
table of contents and test and assembly vendors are denominated in us dollars 
we have not entered into any currency hedging activities 
interest rate risks we also invest in short term investments 
consequently  we are exposed to fluctuation in rates on these investments 
increases or decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of these investments 
in addition  the credit worthiness of the issuer  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument  and other general market conditions may affect the fair values of interest rate sensitive investments 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in interest rates  we invest in highly liquid governmental notes and bonds with contractual maturities of less than two years 
all of the investments have been classified as available for sale  and at december   the fair value of our investments approximated their costs
