item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview and environment tessco technologies incorporated is a leading provider of integrated product plus supply chain solutions to the professionals that design  build  run  maintain and use wireless voice  data  messaging  location tracking and internet systems 
although we sell products to customers in over countries  over of our sales are made to customers in the united states 
we have operations and office facilities in both hunt valley  maryland and reno  nevada 
we offer a wide range of products that are classified into three business segments network infrastructure  mobile devices and accessories  and installation  test and maintenance 
network infrastructure products  which are sold to our commercial sell to and sell through customers  are used to build  repair and upgrade wireless telecommunications  computing and internet networks 
sales of traditional network infrastructure products are in part dependent on capital spending in the wireless communications industry 
however  we have also been growing our offering of wireless broadband and in building products  which are not as dependent on the overall capital spending of the industry 
mobile devices and accessory products include cellular telephones  pagers and two way radios and related accessories 
mobile devices and accessory products are widely sold to commercial sell to and sell through customers and consumers 
commercial customers include retail stores  value added resellers and dealers 
consumers are primarily reached through our affinity partnerships  where we offer services including customized order fulfillment  outsourced call centers  and building and maintaining private label internet sites 
installation  test and maintenance products  which are sold to our commercial sell to and sell through customers  are used to install  tune  maintain and repair wireless communications equipment 
approximately half of all of our installation test and maintenance sales are generated from the sales of replacement parts and materials for original equipment manufacturers such as nokia  inc the other portion of this segment is made up of sophisticated analysis equipment and various frequency  voltage and power measuring devices  as well as an assortment of tools  hardware and supplies required by service technicians 
both our repair and replacement parts sales and consumer sales through our affinity partnerships are reliant on relationships with a small number of vendors 
the emerging wireless communications distribution industry is competitive and fragmented  and is comprised of several national distributors 
in addition  many manufacturers sell direct 
barriers to entry for distributors are relatively low  particularly in the mobile devices and accessory market  and the risk of new competitors entering the market is high 
in addition  the agreements or arrangements with our customers or vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions  including those with t mobile  our largest affinity partner  and nokia  are typically of limited duration and are terminable by either party upon several months notice 
accordingly  our ability to maintain these relationships is subject to competitive pressures and challenges 
we believe  however  that our strength in service  the breadth and depth of our product offering  our information technology system  our large customer base and purchasing relationships with approximately manufacturers provide us with a significant competitive advantage over new entrants to the market 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues from mobile devices and accessories products increased  network infrastructure sales increased  and revenues from installation  test and maintenance products decreased 
network infrastructure  mobile devices and accessories  and installation  test and maintenance products accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of fiscal revenue  as compared to  and  respectively  of fiscal revenues 
revenues across all customer categories increased 
the largest increase was experienced in our consumer category 
commercial sell to customers  commercial sell through customers and consumers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of fiscal revenues  as compared to  and  respectively  of fiscal revenues 
in fiscal  sales of mobile devices and accessories through our affinity consumer direct sales channel represented of our total revenues  but because a significant portion of these sales relate to lower margin handset sales as described below  gross profit from this channel represented only of our total gross profit 
the increase in mobile devices and accessories revenues was primarily due to strong growth in our affinity consumer direct sales channel  as well as growth in our commercial business 
the significant increase in affinity consumer direct revenues is attributed to increased volumes from our ongoing t mobile affinity relationship 
this relationship is an e commerce  complete supply chain relationship 
we sell and deliver wireless telephones and accessories to consumers and other end users 
we purchase the telephones and accessories  record orders via internet ordering tools and hotlines  and then serialize  package and kit the telephones and accessories for delivery to the end user 
handset and accessory revenues from this affinity relationship with t mobile collectively accounted for approximately of total revenues in fiscal year  however  gross profit generated through the t mobile relationship represents a significantly smaller percent of our total gross profit 
commercial revenues for mobile devices and accessories increased over the prior year  due in part to enhanced merchandising and packaging programs and an increase in data product sales 
we believe that pent up demand for improved mobile phone coverage and new broadband technologies led to increased capital spending compared to the prior year  which resulted in the increase in sales of our network infrastructure products 
we also believe that increased spending in homeland security and public safety at the federal  state and local levels have contributed to increased network infrastructure sales 
although we see signs that the market for infrastructure products is stabilizing  there can be no assurances that this trend will continue 
the decline in installation  test and maintenance revenues is primarily attributable to a significant decrease  driven by market conditions  in the selling prices of repair and replacement parts pursuant to our relationship with nokia  inc  under which we supply these materials to nokia inc 
s authorized service centers in the united states 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit margin decreased to from in our network infrastructure segment and decreased to from in our installation  test and maintenance segment 
generally  our gross margins by product within these segments have been sustained and these minor variations are related to sales mix within the segment product offerings 
gross profit margin in our mobile devices and accessories segment decreased to from 
this decrease is wholly attributable to a decrease in gross profit margin for our consumer sales  and was partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin for our commercial sales 
the decrease in gross profit margin for our consumer sales was due to significantly increased volume of lower margin handset sales attributable to our affinity relationship with t mobile 
the minor increase in commercial gross profit margin is attributable to sales mix within the product offering 
we account for inventory at the lower of cost or market  and as a result  write offs write downs occur due to damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in prices and other causes 
our on going ability to earn revenues from customers and vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions  including t mobile and nokia inc  is dependent upon a number of factors 
the terms  and accordingly the factors  applicable to each affinity relationship often differ 
among these factors are the strength of the customer s or vendor s business  the supply and demand for the product or service  including price stability  and our ability to support the customer or vendor and to continually demonstrate that we can improve the way they do business 
we believe that in order to achieve our stated goal of increasing market share through these and our other vendor and customer relationships  we must focus on achieving a higher share of current product categories purchased by our customers  both large and small  on expanding the product categories purchased by these customers  and on continuing to acquire and sell more customers  on a monthly basis 
in addition  the agreements or arrangements on which these affinity relationships are based  including our arrangements with t mobile  which accounted for of our revenues in fiscal  are typically of limited duration  and are terminable by either party upon several months notice 
these affinity relationships could also be affected by wireless carrier consolidation 
we are conscious of these possibilities and are dedicated to superior performance and quality and consistency of service in an effort to maintain and expand these relationships 
thus far  we believe that we have been successful in these efforts  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in this regard in the future or that events beyond our control will not have a negative impact on our ability to maintain or to continue to derive revenue from these relationships 
total selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal due to the increase in revenues and productivity gains discussed below  total selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal  from in fiscal the largest factor for the increase in total selling  general and administrative expenses was increased fulfillment costs associated with the large growth in consumer revenue 
primarily because of the continued success of our affinity relationships  the number of orders we delivered in fiscal grew compared to fiscal these consumer orders are typically smaller in size and weight and many items are delivered to residences  not typical places of business 
the resulting freight charges we pay to third party common carriers with whom we contract for those deliveries are greater  as a percentage of revenue  than larger commercial shipments 
marketing  sales promotion and compensation for commercial business generation also increased in fiscal although our employee count declined slightly from fiscal  the number of employees involved in business generation activities increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal increased compensation expenses are also attributable to approximately  of expense related to a stock option repurchase program completed on june  corporate expenses also increased as a result of increased insurance premiums and increased bad debt expense as noted below  which was primarily a result of increased consumer orders 
we continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve  based on this evaluation 
we also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such prospects based on this evaluation 
accordingly  we recorded a provision for bad debts of  and  for the years ended march  and march   respectively 
the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were partially offset by the results of our productivity and profitability program  which was initiated at the beginning of the third quarter 
this program was designed to improve profitability at current revenue levels and to strengthen our foundation for future profitable growth  and included a restructuring of our organization  policies and processes  and a consolidation of facilities 
selling  general and administrative expense savings were primarily a result of a people count reduction  due to the termination of employees  facility consolidation  and other productivity improvements 
we expect most of these cost savings to continue in future periods  however  a portion of these savings will be offset by expenditures for future growth initiatives 
also related to the productivity program  we recorded million in restructuring charges during the third quarter of fiscal this charge consisted of  in severance pay and other minor costs to implement the productivity and profitability program discussed above and a million charge relating to the consolidation of our distribution facilities from three to two 
the facility consolidation portion of the charge is based on current assumptions  and represents exit costs  including asset write offs  as well as the present value of a continuing facility lease obligation 
due to current real estate market conditions and the short remaining lease term  we currently do not expect to be able to sub lease the vacated facility 
beginning in the fourth quarter  we realized and we expect to continue to realize selling  general and administrative expenses savings of approximately  per quarter relating to this facility consolidation 
however  beginning in june of fiscal  we expect these savings to be offset by additional rent expense discussed in the following paragraph 
restructuring charges related to the present value of the continuing facility obligation will be paid monthly through march  and will be funded from cash flow from operations  if available  or from our revolving credit facility 
we currently have a million liability for the present value of continuing lease obligations related to this vacated facility on our consolidated balance sheet 
certain selling  general and administrative expenses have also been affected as a result of the october  disaster  described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
depreciation expense increased slightly in fiscal most of the assets destroyed in the disaster were replaced toward the end of the third quarter as our global logistics center rebuild was completed 
this increased depreciation was partially offset by depreciation savings from assets destroyed in the disaster  which were written off and are no longer being depreciated 
depreciation also increased due to the opening of our reno  nevada facility in june in fiscal  we expect depreciation expense to increase over fiscal  as there will be a full year of depreciation on both the rebuilt hunt valley facility and the new reno facility 
also  as a result of the october  disaster  we relocated our sales  marketing and administrative offices to a subleased location nearby our global logistics center 
beginning in june of fiscal  we will be incurring approximately  per quarter in rent and related expenses associated with this leased facility  which will be charged to operations 
the rent for this facility was funded by insurance proceeds through may  and therefore was not included in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal see note to the financial statements and summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
also relating to the disaster  we recorded a benefit from insurance proceeds during fiscal of million  representing the final settlement of insurance claims 
we recorded a benefit from insurance proceeds during fiscal of million 
each of these benefits resulted in increased operating income as reported in our consolidated income statements for the applicable periods 
as a result of the factors described above  income from operations increased by  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the operating income margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net interest  fees and other expense increased by  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased credit card fees due to increased sales to consumers 
income before the provision for income taxes decreased  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a result of the factors described above 
the effective tax rates in fiscal and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year increased due to minor changes in the relationship between non deductible expenses and taxable income 
net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal decreased and  respectively  compared to fiscal results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues from mobile devices and accessories products increased significantly  network infrastructure sales decreased  and revenues from installation  test and maintenance products remained flat 
network infrastructure  mobile devices and accessories and installation  test and maintenance products accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of fiscal revenue  as compared to  and  respectively  of fiscal revenues 
revenue increases in the consumer and commercial sell through categories were offset by a decrease in the commercial sell to category 
commercial sell to customers  commercial sell through customers and consumers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of fiscal revenues  as compared to  and  respectively  of fiscal revenues 
we believe that fiscal revenues from all categories were negatively affected by the disaster that occurred in our global logistics center on october  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the recovery efforts delayed the launch of and affected numerous commercial proactive marketing and sales initiatives 
during fiscal  we came to a partial and interim settlement with our insurance carrier on our third quarter business interruption claim in the amount of million 
this amount was recorded as a benefit from insurance proceeds in the consolidated income statements 
because the remainder of our third quarter business interruption claim had not been settled  and since the timing and amount of proceeds from any other future claims for business interruption insurance were uncertain  we were not able to estimate or accrue additional amounts during fiscal we recorded a million insurance receivable on our balance sheet associated with this disaster 
the components of the receivable are million of disaster related expenses  plus million representing the book value of assets destroyed in the disaster  plus the million interim and partial settlement discussed above  less insurance advances from our insurance carrier of million as of march the significant increase in revenues from mobile devices and accessories in fiscal is attributed to increased volumes from our ongoing t mobile affinity relationship  partially offset by the affect of the disaster on our commercial business 
this relationship is an e commerce  complete supply chain relationship 
we sell and deliver wireless telephones and accessories to consumers and other end users 
we purchase the telephones and accessories  record orders via internet ordering tools and hotlines  and then serialize  package and kit the telephones and accessories for delivery to the end user 
the decline in revenues of network infrastructure products during fiscal can be attributed in part to the tight capital markets  as well as to the disaster 
many of our customers were then experiencing difficulty in obtaining consistent and continuing access to capital  thus resulting in decreased capital expenditures and delayed deployment of new technologies and  correspondingly  reduced purchases of our products 
revenue for installation  test and maintenance products was essentially flat from fiscal to fiscal we supply repair and replacement materials to authorized service centers for nokia inc nokia in the united states 
sales of the nokia repair and replacement materials accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal although sales of these products in fiscal increased over fiscal  this increase was offset by a decrease in sales of high value test equipment  which can also be attributed to the disaster and the difficulties described in the above paragraph 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in revenues 
the gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit margin for mobile devices and accessories decreased significantly on significantly increased volume  gross profit margin for installation  test and maintenance products decreased slightly  while gross profit margin for network infrastructure products increased slightly 
the decrease in mobile devices and accessories gross profit margin was attributable to growth in lower margin handset sales related to the expansion of the existing mobile devices and accessories relationship with t mobile  as discussed above 
we account for inventory at the lower of cost or market  and as a result  write offs write downs occur due to damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in prices and other causes 
total selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal total selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal  from in fiscal this increase in total selling  general and administrative expenses was incurred in an effort to drive future growth  as well as in support of the large increase in consumer sales 
we continue to increase our investment in operations and technology personnel 
as of march   we employed people compared to as of march  because of the continued success of our affinity relationships  the number of orders we delivered in fiscal grew significantly compared to fiscal these consumer orders are typically smaller in size and weight and many items are delivered to residences  not typical places of business 
the resulting freight charges we pay to third party common carriers with whom we contract for those deliveries is greater  as a percentage of revenue  than larger commercial shipments 
our information technology support costs  including depreciation  increased this fiscal year as we continue to develop  build  maintain and host private labeled web sites for our affinity partners  as well as continuing to develop tessco 
com and other internal systems 
effective april   in accordance with fas  we no longer amortize goodwill see note to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill expense of  was included in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal we continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve  based on this evaluation 
we also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such prospects based on this evaluation 
accordingly  we recorded a provision for bad debts of  and  for the years ended march  and march   respectively 
as a result of the factors described above  and partially offset by the receipt of a million benefit from insurance proceeds  income from operations decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the operating income margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net interest  fees and other expense decreased by  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease is due to decreased levels of borrowing under our revolving credit facility and lower interest rates  partially offset by increased credit card fees 
income before the provision for income taxes decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a result of the factors described above 
the effective tax rates in fiscal and were and  respectively 
net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal decreased and  respectively  compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources working capital increased to million as of march   from million as of march  shareholders equity increased to million as of march   from million as of march  we generated million of net cash from operating activities in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  our cash flow from operations was driven largely by net income plus depreciation and amortization  a significant increase in trade accounts payable and a significant decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets  partially offset by significant increases in both accounts receivable and product inventory 
the decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily a result of million in cash proceeds received from our insurance carrier related to the disaster 
the large increase in accounts payable is largely a result of increased inventory purchases 
these inventory purchases were necessary to support increased sales volumes and are related to all lines of business  but primarily to the consumer mobile devices and accessories business 
in most cases  we have negotiated open payment terms with our vendors and manufacturers 
we negotiate the duration of these payment terms when establishing and or renewing relationships with vendors and manufacturers and attempt to balance the payment terms with other factors such as pricing  availability of competitive products and anticipated demand 
the timing of payments related to past purchases and the amount of future inventory purchases will create periodic increases and decreases in the accounts payable balance 
trade accounts receivable grew significantly due to increased sales to our customers  many of whom maintain accounts with open terms 
capital expenditures totaled million in fiscal  primarily related to the rebuilding of the global logistics center and investments in information technology 
in fiscal  capital expenditures totaled million  comprised primarily of investments in information technology and improvements made to the americas logistics center 
we used  of net cash from financing activities in fiscal compared to a net usage of million in fiscal during fiscal  pursuant to our stock buyback program   shares of our outstanding common stock were purchased for  or an average price of per share 
the board of directors has authorized the purchase of up to  shares 
we expect to fund any future purchases from working capital and or our revolving credit facility 
also  on june   we completed a stock option repurchase program at which time options for  shares were repurchased and cancelled  in exchange for a cash payment of  see note to the financial statements 
effective september   we established a million revolving line of credit facility with wachovia bank  national association and suntrust bank  replacing our previously existing million revolving credit facility with another lender 
this new facility has a three year term expiring september  is unsecured and interest is payable monthly at the libor rate plus an applicable margin  which ranges from to 
the facility is subject to a borrowing base and certain financial covenants  conditions and representations 
we were in compliance with these covenants at march  there was no outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit facility at march   and we only took minimal draws throughout fiscal we had a note payable to a bank in the amount of million at march   with a scheduled maturity date of june  in june  we received a commitment letter to refinance this note with other financial institutions 
this refinanced note will now be due june  to minimize interest expense  our policy is to use excess available cash to pay down any balance on our revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue when product is shipped to the customer 
our current and potential customers are continuing to look for ways to reduce their inventories and lower their total costs  including distribution  order taking and fulfillment costs  while still providing their customers excellent service 
some of these companies have turned to us to implement supply chain solutions  including purchasing inventory  assisting in demand forecasting  configuring  packaging  kitting and delivering products and managing customer relations  from order taking through cash collections 
in performing these solutions  we assume varying levels of involvement in the transactions and varying levels of credit and inventory risk 
as our solutions offerings continually evolve to meet the needs of our customers  we constantly evaluate our revenue accounting based on the guidance set forth in accounting standards generally accepted in the united states 
when applying this guidance  we look at the following indicators whether we are the primary obligor in the transaction  whether we have general inventory risk  whether we have latitude in establishing price  the extent to which we change the product or perform part of the service  whether we have supplier selection  whether we are involved in the determination of product and service specifications  whether we have physical inventory risk  whether we have credit risk  and whether the amount we earn is fixed 
each of our customer relationships is independently evaluated based on the above guidance and revenue is recorded on the appropriate basis 
if applying this revenue recognition guidance resulted in recording revenue on a different basis from which we have previously concluded  or if the factors above change significantly  revenues could increase or decrease  however  our gross profit would remain constant 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
write offs write downs occur due to damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in prices and other causes 
inventory obsolescence reserves are maintained based on our estimates  historical experience and forecasted demand for our products 
a material change in these estimates could adversely impact our results from operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we use estimates to determine the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts necessary to reduce accounts receivable and unbilled receivables to their expected net realizable value 
we estimate the amount of the required allowance by reviewing the status of past due receivables and analyzing historical bad debt trends 
actual collection experience has not varied significantly from estimates  due primarily to credit policies  collection experience and the company s stability as it relates to its customer base 
typical payments from commercial customers are due days from the date of the invoice 
we charge off receivables deemed to be uncollectible to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable balances are not collateralized 
although we believe that the current allowance is sufficient to cover existing exposures  there can be no assurance against the deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or against defaults that are higher than what has been experienced historically 
if our estimate of this allowance is understated  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
impairment of long lived and indefinite lived assets 
our consolidated balance sheet includes goodwill of approximately million 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  operational performance and legal factors 
based on our valuations of goodwill completed during the fiscal year  we determined that goodwill was not impaired 
future events  such as significant changes in cash flow assumptions  could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value of goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets is impaired 
had the determination been made that the goodwill asset was impaired  the value of this asset would have been reduced by an amount up to million  which would have resulted in a charge to operations 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability 
this review is based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
based on this review  we have not established a valuation allowance 
if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets  resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results 
additional risk factors we are not able to identify or control all circumstances that could occur in the future that may adversely affect our business and operating results 
in addition to risk elsewhere discussed in this annual report on form k  included among the risks that could lead to a materially adverse impact on our business or operating results are failure of our information technology system or distribution system  third party freight carrier interruption  increased competition from competitors  including manufacturers or national and regional distributors of the products we sell and the absence of significant barriers to entry which could result in pricing and other pressures on profitability and market share  technology changes in the wireless communications industry  which could lead to significant inventory obsolescence and or our inability to offer key products that our customers demand  loss of significant customers or relationships  including affinity relationships  the strength of the customers  vendors and affinity partners business  the termination or non renewal of limited duration agreements or arrangements with our vendors and affinity partners which are typically terminable by either party upon several months notice  economic conditions that may impact customers ability to fund purchase of our products and services  our dependence on a relatively small number of suppliers and vendors  which could hamper our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and meet customer demand  the possibility that  for unforeseen reasons  we may be delayed in entering into or performing  or may fail to enter into or perform  anticipated contracts or may otherwise be delayed in realizing or fail to realize anticipated revenues or anticipated savings  inability to protect certain intellectual property  including systems and technologies on which we rely  and consolidation among large wireless service carriers and others within the wireless communications industry
