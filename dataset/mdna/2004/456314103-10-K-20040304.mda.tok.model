the following discussion and analysis contains certain financial predictions  forecasts and projections which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
actual results could differ materially from those financial predictions  forecasts and projections and there can be no assurance that such financial predictions  forecasts and projections will be achieved 
factors that could affect financial predictions  forecasts and projections include the fluctuations in the commodity price index and any conditions internal to the major customers of the registrant  including loss of their accounts 
general the registrant continued to pursue a growth strategy in the waste management services arena servicing over  customer locations throughout the united states  canada  and puerto rico and building a base of approximately  vendors 
this strategy will allow for diversity of business opportunities so that the registrant is not as dependent upon the operating results of the recycling division 
this diversity has helped to stabilize revenues and gross profit during a period of time when commodity prices fluctuate and affect the ferrous and non ferrous markets 
much of management s focus and attention now and in the future is directed towards the growth of the management services business segment through expansion in the existing markets and through an acquisition strategy 
the registrant is also focused on technology enhancements that can be provided to the new and existing customer base to further solidify customer relationships 
additionally  the regist rant is exploring strategic alliances and relationships that will enable it to effectively execute its growth and acquisition strategy 
it is management s plan to expand the management services segment in at the same time  the registrant will be seeking more operational cost control  increased efficiency in the information technology area and emphasize sales and marketing efforts 
management continues to maintain and grow the recycling business within its existing structure and is not actively seeking any further acquisitions or mergers 
it is the plan of management to maximize profits through the reduction of surplus inventory and fixed assets 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the registrant held cash and cash equivalents of  the registrant currently maintains a million senior revolving credit facility with the branch banking and trust company bb t 
indebtedness under this credit facility accrues interest at bank s prime rate 
the maturity date under this agreement is june management plans to request bb t to extend the maturity date of this agreement in the first quarter of the credit line is collateralized by all assets of the registrant 
as of december   there were no borrowings against the line of credit compared to  as of december  the terms of the revolving credit agreement place certain restrictive covenants on the registrant  including maintenance of a specified tangible net worth  debt to net worth and ebitda ratio 
consequently  these covenants restrict the ability of the registrant to incur as much additional debt as it may desire for future growth 
at december   the company was in compliance with all r estrictive covenants 
during  the registrant committed approximately  for fixed asset additions 
in the recycling segment approximately  was committed for the purchase of a hidroeuropa baler  a trailer and several open top containers

existing cash flow from operations and available credit under the existing credit facilities are expected to be sufficient to meet the registrant s cash needs in critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management believes that it consistently applies judgments and estimates and such consistent application results in financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on the registrant s statement of operations and financial conditions 
critical accounting policies  as defined by the securities and exchange commission  are those that are most important to the portrayal of the registrant s financial condition and results of operations and re quire management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the registrant s critical accounting policies and areas that require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements to be income taxes and depreciation the registrant is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the registrant operates 
this process involves estimating the registrant s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the registrant s consolidated balance sheet 
the registrant must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that the registrant believes recovery is not likely  the registrant must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the registrant establishes a valuation allowance in a period  the registrant must include an expense with the tax provision in the statement of operations 
the registrant has not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of recorded deferred tax assets representing future deductions  as the registrant believes it will have sufficient taxable income in the future to realize these deductions 
land is carried at cost 
premises and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization

estimated useful lives are up to years for buildings and leasehold improvements  to years for office and operating equipment  and years for rental equipment 
maintenance and repairs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
gains and losses on disposition of premises and equipment are included in gain loss on sale of assets

inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not and is not expected to have a significant impact on the registrant s operation in the near term 
the registrant has no long term fixed price contracts and the registrant believes it will be able to pass through most cost increases resulting from inflation to its customers 
the registrant is susceptible to the cyclical nature of the commodity business 
in response to these economic conditions  the registrant has focused on the management consulting area of the business and is working to liquidate inventories while efforts are made to enhance gross margins 
impact of recently issued accounting standards fasb interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised in december  changes the accounting model for consolidation from one based on consideration of control through voting interests to a different model 
whether to consolidate an entity will now also consider factors such as whether that entity has sufficient equity at risk to enable it to operate without additional financial support  whether the equity owners in that entity have any obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive residual returns of the entity  or whether voting rights in the entity are not proportional to the equity interest and substantially all the entity s activities are conducted for an investor with few voting rights 
this interpretation changes the rules of consolidation of when to consolidate by changing to a focus on who would incur the expected losses or receive the expected residual returns 
no longer is ownership of over of voting interests the sole criterion for determining whether an entity should be consolidated 
the registrant adopted interpretation  as revised  in the adoption of this statement had no impact on our net results of operation 
in april  the fasb issued statement  rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
statement changes the accounting for debt extinguishments and some minor technical corrections 
debt extinguishments were previously considered extraordinary items 
under this statement  they are part of income from continuing operations and not shown net of tax 
statement also addresses modifications of capital leases 
if a capital lease is modified to become an operating lease  it will be accounted for as a sale leaseback  instead of being accounted for as a new lease 
statement applies for years beginning after may  we adopted statement in the adoption of this statement had no impact on our net results of operation 
the fasb has a project on equity based compensation 
the fasb has tentatively concluded that the fair value based method of accounting is appropriate for stock based employee compensation  which includes stock options 
the proposed statement would be effective for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled in for calendar year end companies 
as of the effective date  compensation cost related to the non vested portion of awards outstanding as of that date would be based on the grant date fair value as calculated under the original provisions of statement the proposed statement is expected to be issued for comment in the first quarter of on february   the registrant announced a two for one stock split with a record date of march  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk there is market risk in our recycling segment  since it is driven by fluctuating commodity prices
