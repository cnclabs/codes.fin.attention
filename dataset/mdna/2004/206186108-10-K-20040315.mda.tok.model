item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a software company that provides a solution to enterprise customers  managed service providers and telecommunication carriers 
our solution  the ehealth suite of products  maps it services to business needs  measures the actual end user experience and manages application  system and network infrastructure 
for the fiscal year ended december   we increased our revenue and profitability year over year 
our total revenues are generated from license revenue and service revenue 
in  total revenues were million  up from million in our diluted earnings per share improved to per share in from per share in fiscal after the low point in  the gradual economic recovery  which started in the second quarter of  continued throughout we generated million in operating cash during the year and finished with million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities after the issuance of million of convertible senior notes 
we sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force  channel partners and other resellers 
we have sales offices in countries  including the united states and we have customers in countries 
last year  we grew our business by improving our core technology  solidifying our existing customer base  and investing in sales and customer support 
first  we improved our core technology the ehealth suite by extending our management capabilities to voip  and strengthening our wireless solution 
second  we significantly expanded our presence in the installed base  most of our license revenue came from existing customers returning to buy new ehealth capabilities 
third  we expanded sales management and customer support staff allowing us to improve the level of service provided to potential and current customers 
in  we took steps to augment our product portfolio by licensing technology from tavve software company tavve and by acquiring and beginning to integrate netviz 
on july   we entered into a license agreement with tavve whereby we licensed components of tavve s technology 
we licensed tavve s root cause analysis and discovery of layer and network topology to build upon our current position in optimizing application availability and performance across networks and systems 
the transaction  valued at million  included million of prepaid maintenance and million of in process research and development 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on july   we completed the acquisition of privately held netviz 
netviz s software enables users to visualize business processes and allows them to map relationships within the supporting technology infrastructure through data driven icons 
consideration for the acquisition totaled million  including transaction costs of million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on december   we raised gross proceeds of million in a convertible debt offering which significantly increased our cash reserves 
we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes and potentially for future acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the coming year  we expect to further integrate our acquired technologies of tavve and netviz  strengthen sales of new and enhanced product offerings and increase profitability through revenue growth 
accomplishing our first goal integrating acquired technologies will provide customers the ability to map their it to business needs  measure the business service in terms of end users experience and manage the entire it infrastructure systems  applications and network 
our second goal is to strengthen sales of new and enhanced products 
to accomplish this  we are enhancing our application partner program  planning several new product releases and developing an overlay application management bsm sales team focused on the application centric portion of our business 
our third goal is to increase profitability by continuing to closely manage our expenses  while focusing on increasing revenue growth 

table of contents critical accounting policies  significant estimates and judgments the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of this annual report on form k and which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by us gaap 
we believe that the policies  significant estimates and judgments discussed below are the most critical to our financial statements and the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
a revenue recognition our revenues consist of software license revenues and service revenues 
software license revenues are recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
software license revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery of the software has occurred  provided that the license fee is fixed or determinable  collection is considered reasonably assured and no customer acceptance clauses exist 
if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  revenue recognition occurs upon the earlier of a receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized when the fees become due 
if collection is not considered reasonably assured  revenue is recognized upon the receipt of cash 
revenues under multiple element arrangements  which typically include software products  services  maintenance and sometimes undelivered specified software upgrades sold together  are allocated to each element using the residual method in accordance with sop under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized when these elements are delivered  the remainder of the arrangement consideration is allocated to the software 
we have established sufficient vendor specific objective evidence for professional services  training  maintenance  customer support services and specified software upgrades based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
accordingly  software license revenues are recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with professional services  training  maintenance  customer support services and specified software upgrades 
service revenues include professional services  training and maintenance and customer support fees 
professional services are not essential to the functionality of the other elements in an arrangement and are accounted for separately 
service revenues are recognized as the services are performed  provided evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered reasonably assured 
we license our software to end users  resellers and oem s 
revenue recognition is centralized at our corporate headquarters  located in the united states 
our arrangements with customers do not generally include provisions involving acceptance of our products by our customers 
however  if a customer arrangement includes an acceptance provision  revenue recognition occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
with respect to revenues from our channel partners and other resellers  we recognize revenue upon delivery of our software to the channel partner or reseller 
we do not offer any right of return  price protection or similar rights to our channel partners and other resellers 

table of contents for all sales  in the absence of a signed license agreement  we use either a purchase order or purchase order equivalent as evidence of an arrangement 
if a signed license agreement is obtained  we use either the license agreement or the license agreement and a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
sales to resellers are usually evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
sales to oem s are usually evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with a shipping report on a transaction by transaction basis 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier and the delivery terms are fob concord 
in the case of arrangements with resellers or oems  revenue is recognized upon delivery to the reseller or oem 
most of these arrangements involve a sell through by the reseller or oem to an end user 
for a reseller  evidence usually comes in the form of a purchase order typically identifying the end user 
for an oem  evidence of sell through usually comes in the form of a shipping report  which usually identifies the ship to location 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are usually to days from invoice date  depending upon the region  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue upon receipt of cash 
concord s channel partners and other resellers are responsible to the company upon delivery 
for arrangements with multiple elements for example  undelivered maintenance and support or undelivered specified software upgrades  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
this means that we defer revenue from the fee arrangement equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
we determine fair values for ongoing maintenance and support obligations using our internal pricing policies for maintenance and by referencing the prices at which we have sold separate maintenance contract renewals to our customers 
we determine fair value of services  such as training or consulting  by referencing the prices at which we have separately sold comparable services to our customers 
for specified undelivered software upgrades  we determine fair value of these upgrades by referencing the prices at which we sell upgrades separately to our customers 
the majority of our sales transactions are completed using standard terms and conditions  however  there are agreements that contain non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple obligations arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to recognize the revenue for each element 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverable elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized for the transaction 
b accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
thus  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 

table of contents c accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
to do this  we estimate our actual current tax liabilities  while also assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue and expense accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
to the extent we reverse any portion of the valuation allowance  we must recognize a benefit within the tax provision in the statement of operations or to additional paid in capital for the benefit of deductions for stock option exercises 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
the company has reserved for its deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance 
the resulting net deferred tax asset of million at december  is based on the company s estimate of future taxable income it expects to generate  all other tax assets have been reserved 
the remaining valuation allowance of million is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
this amount relates to stock option deductions and will be credited to additional paid in capital when released 
if we continue to be sufficiently profitable in  the reserve will be released in in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance 
establishing new or additional valuation allowances could materially adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
d accounting for acquisitions and acquired in process research and development we have completed our acquisition of netviz  which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  which has resulted in recording significant goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition  as determined by management and  with respect to the identifiable intangible assets  an appraisal 
our accounting for the netviz acquisition involves significant judgments and estimates regarding primarily  but not limited to the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which are based on projections of future revenues and cash flows  assumptions regarding discount factors  royalty rates  tax rates  amortization methodologies and related useful lives  as well as the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies and deferred income taxes 
the completed technology software  reseller relationships  maintenance relationships and trade name trademarks will be amortized at the greater of a the ratio that current revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated future revenues or b the straight line method over their respective remaining useful lives 
the contractor agreements will be amortized using the straight line method over their useful lives 
the values of the completed technology  reseller relationships  maintenance relationships  contractor agreements and trade name trademarks were determined using the income approach 
the income approach requires a projection of revenues and expenses specifically attributed to the intangible assets 
the discounted cash flow dcf method is then applied to the potential income streams after making necessary adjustments with respect to such factors as the wasting nature of the identifiable intangible assets and the allowance of a fair return on the net tangible assets and other intangible assets employed 
there are several variations on the income approach  including the relief from royalty method  the avoided cost method and the lost profits method 
the relief from royalty method was used to value the trade name trademarks 
the relief from royalty method is used to estimate the cost savings that accrue to the owner of the intangible assets that would otherwise have to pay royalties or licensee fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset 
the royalty rate used in the analysis is based on an analysis of empirical  market derived royalty rates for guideline intangible assets 
typically  revenue is projected over the expected remaining useful life of the intangible asset 
the market derived royalty rate is then applied to estimate the royalty savings 
the key assumptions used in 
table of contents valuing the trade name trademarks are as follows royalty rate  discount rate  tax rate and estimated average economic life of years 
the avoided cost method was used to value the reseller relationships and contractor agreements 
the avoided cost method considers the concept of avoided cost as an indicator of value 
the avoided cost method is appropriate for estimating the fair value of an asset where reliable data for sales of comparable property are not available and where the property does not directly produce an income stream 
the key assumptions used in valuing the reseller relationships are as follows tax rate and estimated average economic life of years 
the key assumptions used in valuing the contractor agreements are as follows tax rate and estimated average economic life of years 
the completed technology software was valued using the income approach without variation 
the key assumptions used in valuing the completed technology are as follows discount rate  tax rate and estimated life of years 
the key assumptions used in valuing the maintenance relationship are as follows discount rate  tax rate and estimated average economic life of years 
deferred income taxes and any valuation allowances are based in part on future estimated profitability of the company 
as a direct result of the netviz acquisition  the company has estimated that future profitability will increase and therefore released million of the valuation allowance 
we have also completed our accounting of the license agreement with tavve whereby concord licensed components of tavve s technology 
our accounting for the tavve license as in process research development involved significant judgments and estimates regarding primarily  but not limited to assessing if the acquired technology has reached technological feasibility and if the acquired technology has no alternative future use 
technological feasibility is established when either of two sets of criteria is met a the detail program design has been completed  documented  and traced to product specifications and its high risk development issues have been resolved  or b a working model of the product has been finished and determined to be complete and consistent with the product design 
upon acquiring the licensed components of tavve s technology  concord did not have a completed product design at the time of the purchase as it had not completed  documented  and traced the detail program design to product specifications 
concord also did not have the high risk development issues resolved 
a working model is defined as an operative version of the computer software product that is completed in the same software language as the product to be ultimately marketed  performs all the major functions planned for the product  and is ready for initial customer testing usually identified as beta testing 
upon acquiring the licensed components of tavve s technology  concord did not have a working model as defined 
in addition  the purchased source code has no alternative future use  ie  concord will not use the source code for any other purpose than described above 
the detail program design for the integration of tavve s technology into concord ehealth suite of products has not been completed  thus  the exact costs and efforts required for completion of this integration has not been determined 
based on management s initial estimates  an integrated product based on tavve s technology will be introduced in the next to months 
however  as with any major software development project  actual introduction may vary 
failure to successfully market and sell our integrated product may adversely impact our business 
e valuation of long lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the long lived tangible assets are fixed assets  which are depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the long lived intangible assets are completed technology software  reseller relationships  maintenance relationships  contractor agreements  
table of contents and trade name trademarks which are amortized over their estimated useful lives following the greater of the pattern in which the expected benefits will be consumed or otherwise used up or on a straight line basis 
goodwill is not amortized 
at each quarter end  the carrying value of the completed technology software is compared to its net realizable value nrv 
nrv is the estimated future gross revenues from products that incorporate the software reduced by the estimated future costs of disposal 
if nrv is less than the carrying value  the excess is written off and the then current nrv becomes the new carrying value of the software 
we assess the potential impairment of other identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment of such assets  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying value  including goodwill 
when the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than fair value  the unit s goodwill may be impaired  and the second step must be completed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment charge  if any 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount is greater than the implied fair value  the carrying value of the goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value 
we operate in one reporting unit and  therefore  will conduct future goodwill impairment test on an enterprise wide level 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill might be impaired 
we plan to perform the annual assessment at june of each fiscal year 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment of goodwill  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the useful lives of our intangible assets  determining what reporting units exist and assessing when events or circumstances would require an interim impairment analysis of goodwill or other long lived assets to be performed 
changes in events or circumstances  including but not limited to technological advances or competition which could result in shorter useful lives  additional reporting units which may require alternative methods of estimating fair value  or economic or market conditions which may affect previous assumptions and estimates  could have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position through accelerated amortization expense or impairment charges

the resulting net deferred tax asset of million is based on the company s estimate of future taxable income it expects to generate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a market and interest rate risk most of concord s current export sales are denominated in united states dollars 
to the extent that a majority of our international sales continue to be denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could make our products and services more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in international markets 
substantially all of our business outside the united states is conducted in us dollar denominated transactions  whereas our operating expenses in our international branches are denominated in local currency 
we believe that the operating expenses of our foreign operations are immaterial  and therefore any associated market risk is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents all of the company s investments are in investment grade securities with high credit ratings of relatively short duration that trade in highly liquid markets and are carried at fair value on the company s books 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe we have minimal market risk 
the company s investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
b foreign currency exchange rate risk we use forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies held until such receivables are collected 
a forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates 
these forward contracts  to qualify as hedges of existing assets  are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying foreign currency receivables are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date that approximate the value and expected settlement date  respectively  of the underlying transactions 
for contracts that are designated and effective as hedges  unrealized gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period  resulting from changes in the fair value of these contracts  are recognized in earnings in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying foreign denominated receivables are recognized and generally offset 
we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes  and we only enter into contracts with highly rated financial institutions 
at december   we had no forward contracts outstanding 
we plan to continue to utilize forward contracts and other instruments in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations from accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies  and we may not be able to do this successfully 
accordingly  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
also  as we continue to expand our operations outside of the united states  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could increase
