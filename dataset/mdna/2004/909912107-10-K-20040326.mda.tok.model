in strategies designed to hedge overall market risk  the company may sell commo n stock short or participate in put and or call options

amounts due under th e guaranty are reduced by the scheduled principal payments under the mortgage 
th e guaranty is enforceable upon the occurrence of certain events  including a default as defined in the mortgage and expires upon satisfaction of the loan i n april pursuant to the operating agreement  any payments made under th e guaranty would increase the guarantors ownership interest 
the company believe s that the collateral of the underlying hotel is sufficient to repay the mortgag e without requiring enforcement of the guaranty 
accordingly  the fair value o f the guarantee was determined to be insignificant and  therefore  no liabilit y has been recorded

critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance wit h accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of americ a requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions tha t affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  an d related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain of th e estimates and assumptions required to be made relate to matters that ar e inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
while management believe s that the estimates and assumptions used were the most appropriate  actua l results could differ significantly from those estimates under differen t assumptions and conditions 
the following is a description of those accountin g policies believed by management to require subjective and complex judgment s which could potentially affect reported results 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable real estate investmen t and management the company leases substantially all of its properties to tenants under ne t leases which are accounted for as operating leases 
under this type of lease the tenant is obligated to pay all operating costs of the property includin g real estate taxes  insurance and repairs and maintenance 
revenue is recognize d as it is earned and deemed collectible 
gains on the sale of real estate asset s and equity investments are recorded when the gain recognition criteria unde r generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america hav e been met 
certain lease agreements provide for additional rent based on a percentage o f tenants sales 
these percentage rents are recorded once the required sale s levels are achieved 
income on leveraged leases is recognized by a method that produces a constan t rate of return on the outstanding investment in the lease  net of the relate d deferred tax liability in the years in which the net investment is positive 
accounts receivable are recorded at the outstanding amounts net of the allowanc e for doubtful accounts 
the company makes estimates of the uncollectibility o f its accounts receivable related to base rents  tenant escalations  expens e reimbursements and other revenues 
the company analyzes accounts receivable an d historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economi c trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
i n addition  tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made i n connection with the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims the company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate of th e collectibility of accounts receivable 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable engineered products in general  sales are recorded when products are shipped  title has passed an d collection is reasonably assured 
management believes that adequate controls ar e in place to ensure compliance with contractual product specifications  a substantial history of such performance has been established and historica l returns and allowances have not been significant 
if actual sales returns an d allowances exceed historical amounts  the company s sales would be adversel y affected 
accounts receivable are recorded at the outstanding amounts net of the allowanc e for doubtful accounts 
estimates are used in determining the company s allowanc e for doubtful accounts based on historical collections experience  curren t economic trends and a percentage of its accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages  the company looks at historical write offs o f its receivables 
the company also looks at the credit quality of its custome r base as well as changes in its credit policies 
the company continuousl y monitors collections and payments from its customers 
while credit losses hav e historically been within expectations and the provisions established  th e company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credi t loss rates that it has in the past 
the company s net income is directl y affected by management s estimate of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
marketable securities the company determines the appropriate classification of marketable securitie s at the time of purchase and reassesses the appropriateness of the classificatio n at each reporting date 
at december  and  all marketable securitie s held by the company have been classified as either available for sale or tradin g and  as a result  are stated at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses o n available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component o f stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities a s well as unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities  as determine d on a first in  first out basis  are included in the consolidated statements o f income 
the company reviews its investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether o r not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value if it is believed that an other than temporary decline exists  the company wil l write down the investment to market value and record the related write down as a loss on investments in the consolidated statements of income 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s classification o f marketable securities as well as its determination of whether a n other than temporary decline in the value of its investments exist 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market  cost bein g determined on a first in  first out basis 
the company regularly review s inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolet e inventory based primarily on existing and anticipated design and engineerin g changes to its products as well as forecasts of future product demand 
th e company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate of th e realizability of inventories 
real estate land  buildings and improvements and equipment are recorded at cost  les s accumulated depreciation and amortization 
expenditures for maintenance an d repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
significant renovations an d replacements  which improve the life of the asset  are capitalized an d depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation is computed utilizing the straight line method over the estimate d useful lives of five to thirty nine years for buildings and improvements an d five to seven years for equipment 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fai r value less costs to sell and depreciation is discontinued 
property sales o r dispositions are recorded when title transfers 
upon disposition  the relate d costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts 
an y gain or loss on sale or disposition is recognized in accordance with accountin g principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in the norma l course of business  the company receives offers for the sale of properties either solicited or unsolicited 
for those offers that are accepted  th e prospective buyer usually requires a due diligence period before consummation o f the transaction 
it is not unusual for matters to arise that result in th e withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process 
if circumstances aris e that previously were considered unlikely and  as a result  management decide s not to sell a property classified as held for sale  the property is reclassifie d as held for rental 
a property that is reclassified is measured and recorde d individually at the lower of its carrying amount before being classified as hel d for sale  adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognize d had the property been continuously classified as held for rental or its fai r market value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives o f its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflec t on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company adjust th e expected useful life of a particular asset  it would be depreciated over th e adjusted years  and result in a revised depreciation expense and net income 
discontinued operations the company is required to make certain subjective assessments utilizing th e provisions of sfas no 
in determining whether a long lived asset to b e disposed of should be reclassified as discontinued operations 
commencing i n  the company considered real property to be held for sale and reported a s discontinued operations if management committed to a plan to sell the asse t under usual and customary terms and believes such sale will be completed withi n one year 
in such event  the financial results associated with these assets ar e reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
althoug h operating income  income from continuing operations and income from discontinue d operations is directly affected by management s assessments  th e reclassification has no impact on net income 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators tha t the value of its long lived assets may be impaired 
an asset s value i s considered impaired only if management s estimate of current and projecte d operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the asse t over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the asset such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operatin g income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition an d other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying amount of th e asset would be written down to an amount to reflect the fair value of the asset the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there ar e impairments in the value of its long lived assets and other investments 
th e company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate o f impairments 
in determining impairment  if any  the company has adopted sfas no pension plan pension plans can be a significant cost of doing business  but represen t obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and therefore ar e subject to estimates 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognitio n of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based o n the terms of the plan and the investment and funding decisions made by th e company 
the company is required to make assumptions regarding such variables a s the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied t o determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expens e for the year 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance wit h sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
 whic h requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on a n actuarial basis 
sfas no 
generally reduces the volatility of future incom e expense from changes in pension liability discount rates and the performanc e of the pension plan s assets 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension incom e expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on pla n assets will be for and as compared to for based on th e company s existing and forecasted asset allocation and related long ter m investment performance results  the company believes that its assumption o f future returns of is reasonable 
the assumed long term rate of return o n assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes change s in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner 
this produces th e expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income expense 
th e difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets i s deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculate d value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income expense 
durin g and  the plan assets have earned a rate of return less than 
thi s decline was due  in large part  to general declines in the market value o f investments 
during  the company s pension plan investments experienced a n approximate rate of return 
a basis point change in the expecte d long term rate of return on plan assets would have changed fiscal pensio n expense by  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from th e potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result o f fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodit y prices 
derivative financial instruments are used by the company principally i n the hedging of overall market risks and the management of its interest rat e exposure 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserv e principal and maximize yields without significantly increasing market risk 
t o achieve this  management maintains a portfolio of cash equivalents an d investments in a variety of securities  primarily us investments in bot h common and preferred equity issues 
funds of the company in excess of that needed for working capital  purchasin g real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested b y the company in corporate equity securities  corporate notes  certificates o f deposit  government securities and other financial instruments 
changes in u 
s interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cas h equivalent balances and other interest bearing investments 
given the level o f cash currently held by the company and the decline in us interest rates ove r the past several years  the company s earnings have been negatively impacted 
the company s marketable securities consist of us investments in both commo n and preferred equity issues and are subject to the fluctuations in us stoc k markets 
most of the company s mortgages payable are fixed rate and sel f amortizing from the net cash flow of the underlying properties 
the company s derivative instruments primarily consist of put and or call options 
suc h derivatives are subject to the fluctuations in us stock markets 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and mexico and sell s its products in those markets as well as europe  south america and asia 
as a result  the company s operating results could be affected by factors such a s changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in th e foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
most of th e company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
a portion of the company s receivables are denominated in euros and are exposed to changes in exchang e rates with the us dollar 
when the us dollar strengthens against the euro the value of the nonfunctional currency sales decreases 
when the us dolla r weakens against the euro  the functional currency amount of sales increases overall  the company is a net receiver of euros and  as such  benefits from a weaker dollar  but is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to th e euro 
the company s manufacturing operations utilize various metal commoditie s principally stainless steel in the manufacturing process 
while key metal s purchased from foreign entities are generally denominated in us dollars fluctuations in the suppliers local currencies may impact pricing

the success of our engineered products segment depends in large part on genera l business conditions of our customers and general economic conditions 
if th e economy slows either in the united states or in foreign countries in which w e sell our products  some of our current and prospective customers may decreas e spending on engineered products and accordingly may postpone  reduce or eve n forego the purchase of our products 
if forecasted orders are not received  w e may have large inventories of slow moving or unusable parts 
this could resul t in an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  liquidity an d financial position 
our markets are highly competitive 
the markets for our engineered products are highly competitive 
we cannot assur e that we will be able to successfully compete or that our competitors will no t develop new technologies and products that are more commercially effective tha n our own 
some of our competitors have financial  technical  marketing  sales an d distribution resources greater than ours 
reliance on significant customers 
the company sells its engineered products to many customers throughout th e world 
historically  a small number of customers accounted for significan t portions of these sales 
for the year ended december   sales by th e engineered products to its largest customer accounted for of the segment s sales 
the loss of this customer or one or more of other significant customer s could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
protection of our intellectual property is limited  we are subject to the ris k of third party claims of infringement 
our engineering business relies in large part upon our proprietary scientifi c and engineering know how and production techniques 
historically  patents hav e not been an important part of our protection of our intellectual propert y rights 
we rely upon the laws of unfair competition  restrictions in licensin g agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property we limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth wil l depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology an d operate without infringing upon the rights of others 
our operations are subject to environmental regulation and environmenta l problems which are possible and can be costly 
our engineered products segment is subject to a variety of local  state an d federal governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardou s substances used to manufacture our products 
we believe that we are currently i n compliance in all material respects with such regulations and that we hav e obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business nevertheless  the failure to comply with current or future regulations coul d result in the imposition of fines  suspension of production  alteration of ou r manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of th e environment require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate t o investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances at such property

our performance is subject to risks associated with the real estate industry 
although the company s leases are generally long term and may be below market real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and ar e relatively illiquid 
several factors may adversely affect the economi c performance and value of our properties 
these factors include changes in th e national  regional and local economic climate  the attractiveness of ou r properties to tenants  competition from other available property owners an d changes in market rental rates 
our performance also depends on the financia l condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rent from tenants and to pa y for adequate maintenance  insurance and other operating costs  including rea l estate taxes  which could increase over time 
also  the expenses of owning an d operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such a s market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property
