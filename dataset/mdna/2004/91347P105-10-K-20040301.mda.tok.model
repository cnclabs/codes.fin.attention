item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled selected financial data in this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes to this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully discussed in the section below entitled risk factors 
overview we are a leader in the research  development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode  or oled  technologies for use in a variety of flat panel display and other applications 
since  we have been exclusively engaged  and expect to continue to be exclusively engaged  in funding and performing research and development activities relating to oled technologies and materials  and in attempting to commercialize these technologies and materials 
our revenues are generated through contract research  sales of development and commercial chemicals  development and technology evaluation agreements and license fees 
during  we recognized our first commercial chemical sales and license fee revenues 
also in  we entered into an expanded technology development contract with a longstanding partner and recognized revenue from that and other similar contracts 
although these events show the progress we have made in introducing our oled technologies and materials into the marketplace  there can be no certainty that these trends will continue 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of december  moreover  we expect our losses to continue for the foreseeable future and until such time  if ever  as we are able to achieve  from the commercial licensing of our oled technologies and the sale of our oled materials  sustained licensing and chemical sales revenues that are sufficient to support our ongoing research and development activities and other operations 
we anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations for the foreseeable future due to uncertainty regarding o the timing of our receipt of license fees and fees for future technology development and evaluation  o the timing and volume of sales of our oled materials for both commercial usage and evaluation purposes  o the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development activities  and o the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may  under different assumptions and conditions  differ significantly from our estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred license fees  valuation of acquired technology and stock based compensation as described below  are our critical accounting policies as contemplated by the securities and exchange commission 
these policies are discussed in greater detail below 
revenue recognition and deferred license fees contract research revenues represent reimbursements by the us government for all or a portion of the research and development expenses we incur related to our government contracts 
revenues are recognized proportionally as research and development expenses are incurred or as defined milestones are achieved 
in order to ascertain the revenues associated with these contracts for a period  we estimate the proportion of related research and development expenses incurred and whether defined milestones have been achieved 
different estimates would result in different revenues for the period 
we also receive non refundable advance payments under certain of our development and technology evaluation agreements 
these payments are deferred until a license agreement is executed or negotiations have ceased and there is no likelihood of executing a license agreement with the other party 
if a license agreement is executed  these revenues will be recorded over the expected life of the licensed technology  otherwise  they will be recorded at the time negotiations with the other party show no further likelihood of success 
if we estimate differently the expected life of this licensed technology  reported revenue during the relevant period will differ 
to date  no deferred license fees have been recognized as revenue 
as of december    was recorded as deferred revenue 
valuation of acquired technology we regularly review our acquired oled technologies for events or changes in circumstances that might indicate the carrying value of these technologies may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could cause impairment include  among others  significant changes in our anticipated future use of these technologies and our overall business strategy as it pertains to these technologies  particularly in light of patents owned by others in the same field of use 
as of december   we believe that no revision of the remaining useful lives or write down of our acquired technology was required for  nor was such a revision needed in or if such a write down is required in the future  it could be for up to  the net book value of the acquired technology as of december  valuation of stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  under which no compensation cost is recognized for options issued to employees at fair market value on the date of grant 
in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
sfas establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans 
sfas requires that a company s financial statements include certain disclosures about stock based employee compensation arrangements regardless of the method used to account for the plan 
we account for our stock option and warrant grants to non employees in exchange for goods or services in accordance with sfas and emerging issues task force no 
eitf 
sfas and eitf require that we account for our option and warrant grants to non employees based on the fair value of the options and warrants granted 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options we have granted for purposes of making the disclosure required by sfas in order to calculate the fair value of the options  assumptions are made for certain components of the model  including risk free interest rate  volatility  expected dividend yield rate and expected option life 
although we use available resources and information when setting these assumptions  changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to the valuation 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per share for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss attributable to holders of our common stock was primarily due to o an increase in total revenue  as described below  and o a decrease of non cash expense relating to the debt conversion and extinguishment of convertible promissory notes we issued in august  and a decrease in non cash interest expense see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to o additional payments under technology development and evaluation agreements and additional purchases of materials by our development partners  and o providing oled material to a customer for its use in the manufacture of commercial oled displays under an arrangement entered into in we earned  from sales of our oled materials for evaluation purposes for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly due to an increased volume of oled materials purchased for evaluation by potential oled display manufacturers  including our current development partners 
we entered into an arrangement in the third quarter of under which we began supplying one of our proprietary oled materials to a customer for use in the manufacture of commercial passive matrix oled displays 
as a result  we earned  in commercial chemical revenue and  in license fees in connection with this arrangement for the year ended december  there were no such arrangements in effect during we recognized  in technology development revenue for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase related to new and continuing technology development and evaluation agreements in we earned  in contract research revenue from the us government for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the dollar value and the number of our government contracts remained relatively constant during and  and several of these contracts are expected to continue into we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of o an increase of  in non cash operating expense associated with our development and license agreement with ppg industries  due to the increased price of our common stock  o an increase of  in costs associated with the increased number of patents filed in as compared to  o an increase of  in costs for the further development and operation of our facility in ewing  new jersey  and o stock performance bonuses of  to research and development employees 
no such bonuses were awarded in the increase was offset by a  decrease in costs associated with our scientific advisory board  due to the timing of payments 
we incurred general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was a result of an increase of  in costs associated with new and existing personnel and stock performance bonuses of  awarded to employees 
there were no such stock performance bonuses issued in in september   of the  in convertible promissory notes that we had issued in august the notes were converted into shares of our common stock  with the remaining amount being repaid in cash 
as of the date of conversion and repayment  the  face value of the notes exceeded their then carrying value due to an unamortized original issuance discount oid and beneficial conversion feature bcf on the notes 
as a result  upon the conversion and repayment of the notes  we recognized a non cash debt conversion and extinguishment expense of  related to the unamortized portion of the oid and bcf and the intrinsic value of the notes repurchased 
during  there were no such expenses see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we had no interest expense for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the retirement and conversion of the notes in september and the fact that there was no debt in  which compares to in which we recorded the amortization of oid and bcf of the notes see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  the conversion price of the series b convertible preferred stock we issued to motorola  inc in september was adjusted in accordance with the certificate of designations for this stock 
we accounted for this adjustment as a contingent beneficial conversion feature cbcf 
as a result  we recorded the cbcf as a deemed dividend in the amount of  in  the adjustment resulted in a deemed dividend of  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in august  we completed an offering that was deemed dilutive under the terms of certain warrants we had previously issued and resulted in a reduction of the exercise prices of some of these warrants and an increase in the number of shares issuable under certain of these warrants 
we treated and recorded this occurrence as a deemed dividend in the amount of  no such dividends were recorded in the weighted average anti dilution provisions of these warrants will be triggered in the future if we issue additional shares below the various exercise prices of these warrants 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per share for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to o an increase in cash and non cash research and development expenses  as described below  and o an increase in non cash interest expense on the notes we issued in august  as well as our incurring non cash expense relating to the conversion and extinguishment of the notes see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  we earned  in contract research revenue from the us government in  compared to  in the increase was primarily due to our commencement of work under six new government contracts in  with work under four of these contracts beginning in the third and fourth quarters of in  contract revenue was derived from three government contracts  one of which was completed in the third quarter of we earned  from our sales of oled materials for evaluation purposes in  compared to  in the increase was mainly due to an increased volume of oled materials purchased for evaluation by potential oled display manufacturers  including our technology development and evaluation partners 
we commenced sales of oled materials for evaluation purposes in during  we received non refundable cash payments of  in the aggregate in connection with our technology development and evaluation and license agreements  compared to  in similar cash payments we received in of the cash payments we received in  we recognized revenues of  as fees for technology development and evaluation  with the remainder being recorded as unearned revenue 
the increase in cash payments received resulted from our entering into new technology development and evaluation and license agreements in  as well as from our receiving additional payments under agreements of this nature that were in place during during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax net operating losses nols to new jersey under the technology tax certificate transfer program 
we received  for the sale of these nols and recorded it as other revenue 
we did not sell any of our nols prior to  but may do so in the future 
we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly attributable to the following o an increase of  in costs associated with increased salaries and costs incurred in connection with  and as a result of  the expansion of our facility in ewing  new jersey  o an increase of  in costs associated with an increased number of patents filed in as compared to  and o an increase of  in non cash charges in connection with our development and license agreement with ppg industries see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase was offset by a  decrease in costs associated with our scientific advisory board  relating to the valuation of warrants received for compensation 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly due to increased salaries and costs incurred in connection with  and as a result of  the expansion of our facility in ewing  new jersey 
we also experienced an increase in marketing costs  including costs relating to public relations and shareholder services 
in september   of the  in notes that we had issued were converted into shares of our common stock  with the remaining amount being repaid by us in cash 
as of the date of conversion and repayment  the  face value of the notes exceeded their then carrying value due to an unamortized oid and bcf on the notes 
as a result  upon the conversion and repayment of the notes  we recognized a non cash debt conversion and extinguishment expense of  related to the unamortized portion of the oid and bcf and the intrinsic value of the notes repurchased 
in the same period in  there were no such expenses see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our interest expense was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to amortization of the oid and bcf of the notes see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  the conversion price of the series b convertible preferred stock we issued to motorola in september was adjusted in accordance with the certificate of designations for this stock 
we accounted for this adjustment as a cbcf 
as a result  we recorded the cbcf as a deemed dividend in the amount of  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  short term investments of  and investments in certificates of deposit and other liquid instruments with an original maturity of more than one year of  this compares to cash and cash equivalents of  short term investments of  and investments in certificates of deposit and other liquid instruments with an original maturity of more than one year of  as of december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments of  was primarily due to an increase in funds from our registered direct offering in  less cash used in operations  as detailed below 
during  cash used in operating activities was  as compared to  in the increase was mainly due to a decrease in non refundable cash payments received in as compared to in  we received  in the aggregate in connection with our new and existing technology development and evaluation and license agreements  of which  was recognized as revenue in this compares to  in aggregate payments that we received in in connection with similar agreements  of which  was recognized as revenue in this decrease was offset in part by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
in august  we completed a registered direct offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the offering resulted in proceeds to us of  net of  in costs associated with completion of the offering 
in august  we completed a registered direct offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
in september  we completed a subsequent registered direct offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
these offerings resulted in aggregate proceeds to us of  net of  in costs associated with completion of the offerings 
working capital increased to  as of december   from working capital of  as of december  the net increase was due primarily to the completion of the august registered direct offering of our common stock 
our net cash used in operating activities was  in and  in non cash expenses related to the issuance of our common stock  warrants and options to purchase our common stock  and the amortization of discounts relating to the issuance  conversion and repayment of convertible debt see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements were  in and  in we anticipate  based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations including  among others  assumptions regarding our working capital requirements  the progress of our research and development efforts  the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work  and the timing and costs associated with the preparation  filing  prosecution  maintenance and enforcement of our patents and patent applications  that we have sufficient cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to meet our obligations into we believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long term and short term borrowings  public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of warrants and options 
we have an effective shelf registration statement that would enable us to offer  from time to time  up to  of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and other securities  subject to market conditions and other factors 
it should be noted  however  that substantial additional funds will be required in the future for research  development and commercialization of our oled technologies and materials  to obtain and maintain patents respecting these technologies and materials  and for working capital and other purposes  the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain 
for example  under our research agreement with princeton university  we are required to pay princeton university  per year through july there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual commitments payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years more than years long term debt operating lease obligations     capital lease obligations   purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap other obligations sponsored research obligation    minimum royalty obligation      year total     year under our amended license agreement with princeton university and the university of southern california  we are obligated to pay princeton university minimum royalties of  per year until such time as the agreement is no longer in effect 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or similar arrangements serving as credit  liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets  or obligations including contingent obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or that engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
recently issued accounting pronouncements the adoption of sfas nos 
  and and fasb interpertation nos 
and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 which provides accounting guidance for customer solutions where delivery or performance of products  services and or performances may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
companies are required to adopt this consensus for fiscal periods beginning after june  we believe the adoption of eitf issue no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the following factors  as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition  could cause our actual future results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected 
we do not expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future  and may never be profitable 
since inception  we have generated limited revenues while incurring significant losses 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and until such time  if ever  as we are able to achieve sufficient levels of revenue from the commercial exploitation of our oled technologies and materials to support our operations 
you should note  however  that o oled technologies may never become commercially viable  o markets for flat panel displays utilizing oled technologies may be limited  and o we may never generate sufficient revenues from the commercial exploitation of our oled technologies and materials to become profitable 
even if we find commercially viable applications for our oled technologies and materials  we may never recover our research and development expenses 
if we do not receive additional financing in the future  we might not be able to continue the research  development and commercialization of our oled technologies and materials 
our capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
substantial additional funds will be required in the future for research  development and commercialization of our oled technologies and materials  to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights in these technologies and materials  and for working capital and other purposes  the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain 
our cash on hand may not be sufficient to meet all of our future needs 
when we need additional funds  such funds may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we cannot obtain more money when needed  our business might fail 
additionally  if we attempt to raise money in an offering of shares of our common stock  preferred stock  warrants or depositary shares  or if we engage in acquisitions involving the issuance of such securities  the issuance of these shares will dilute our then existing shareholders 
if our oled technologies and materials are not feasible for broad based product applications  we may never generate revenues sufficient to support ongoing operations 
before display manufacturers will agree to utilize our oled technologies and materials for wide scale commercial production  they will likely require us to demonstrate to their satisfaction that our oled technologies and materials are feasible for broad based product applications 
this  in turn  will require substantial advances in our research and development efforts in a number of areas  including o device reliability  o the development of long lived oled materials for full color oled displays  and o issues related to scalability and cost effective fabrication technologies for product applications 
our efforts may never demonstrate the feasibility of our oled technologies and materials for broad based product applications 
our research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging and innovative technologies  including  without limitation  unanticipated technical or other problems and the possible insufficiency of funds for completing development of these products 
technical problems may result in delays and cause us to incur additional expenses that would increase our losses 
if we cannot complete research and development of our oled technologies and materials successfully  or if we experience delays in completing research and development of our oled technologies and materials for use in potential commercial applications  particularly after incurring significant expenditures  our business may fail 
even if our oled technologies are technically feasible  they may not be adopted by display manufacturers 
the potential size  timing and viability of market opportunities targeted by us are uncertain at this time 
market acceptance of our oled technologies will depend  in part  upon these technologies providing benefits comparable to cathode ray tube  or crt  display and lcd technologies the current standard display technologies at an appropriate cost  and the adoption of these technologies by consumers  neither of which has been achieved 
also  there may be a number of additional technologies that display manufacturers need to utilize to be used in conjunction with our oled technologies in order to bring oled displays and products containing them to the market 
many potential licensees of our oled technologies manufacture flat panel displays utilizing competing technologies  and may  therefore  be reluctant to redesign their products or manufacturing processes to incorporate our oled technologies 
moreover  even if our oled technologies are a viable alternative to competing technologies  if additional technologies are required to be used in conjunction with our oled technologies to bring oled displays and products containing them to the market and display manufacturers are unable to obtain access to these technologies  they may not utilize our oled technologies 
there are numerous potential alternatives to oleds for flat panel displays  which may limit our ability to commercialize our oled technologies and materials 
the flat panel display market is currently  and will likely continue to be for some time  dominated by displays based on lcd technology 
numerous companies are making substantial investments in  and conducting research to improve characteristics of  lcds 
several other flat panel display technologies have been  or are being  developed  including technologies for the production of field emission  inorganic electroluminescence  gas plasma and vacuum fluorescent displays 
advances in lcd technology or any of these technologies may overcome their current limitations and permit them to become the leading technologies for flat panel displays  either of which could limit the potential market for flat panel displays utilizing our oled technologies and materials 
this  in turn  would cause display manufacturers to avoid entering into commercial relationships with us  or to terminate or not renew their existing relationships with us 
other oled technologies may be more successful than ours 
our competitors have developed oled technologies that differ from or compete with our oled technologies 
these competing oled technologies entered the marketplace prior to ours and may become entrenched in the flat panel industry before our oled technologies have a chance to become widely utilized 
moreover  our competitors may succeed in developing new oled technologies that are more cost effective or have fewer display limitations than our oled technologies 
if our oled technologies  and particularly our phosphorescent oled technology  are unable to capture a substantial portion of the oled display market  our business strategy may fail 
many of our competitors have greater resources  and it may be difficult to compete against them 
the flat panel display industry is characterized by intense competition 
many of our competitors have better name recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing  personnel and research capabilities than us 
because of these differences  we may never be able to compete successfully in the oled display market 
the flat panel display industry has historically experienced significant downturns  which may adversely affect the demand for and pricing of our oled technologies and materials 
the flat panel display industry has experienced significant periodic downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by lower product demand  production overcapacity and erosion of average selling prices 
our business strategy is dependent on display manufacturers building and selling displays that incorporate our oled technologies and materials 
industry wide fluctuations and downturns in the demand for flat panel displays  and oled displays in particular  could cause significant harm to our business 
if our research partners fail to make advances in their research  or if they terminate or elect not to renew their relationships with us  we might not succeed in commercializing our oled technologies and materials 
research and development of commercially viable applications for our oled technologies and materials depend substantially on the success of the work conducted by our research partners 
we cannot be certain that our research partners will make additional advances in the research and development of these technologies and materials 
moreover  although we fund oled technology research  the scope of and technical aspects of this research and the resources and efforts directed to this research are in large part subject to the control of our research partners 
our most significant research and development relationships are with princeton university and the university of southern california 
our research agreement with princeton university expires in july and both this agreement and our amended license agreement with princeton university and the university of southern california the agreement under which we license our key oled technology patents can be terminated for various reasons 
for example  the research agreement provides that if dr 
stephen r 
forrest  the principal investigator for our research program with princeton university  is unavailable to continue to serve in this capacity  because he is no longer associated with princeton university or for any other reason  and a successor acceptable to both us and princeton university is not available  princeton university has the right to terminate the research agreement without impacting the amended license agreement 
termination of the research agreement or the amended license agreement would materially and adversely affect our ability to research  develop and commercialize our oled technologies and materials 
if we cannot form and maintain lasting business relationships with oled display manufacturers  our business strategy will fail 
our business strategy ultimately depends upon our development and maintenance of commercial licensing and material supply relationships with high volume manufacturers of oled displays 
as of december   we had entered into only two such relationships  one with dupont displays  inc and one with tohoku pioneer corporation 
all of our other relationships with display manufacturers currently are limited to technology development and the evaluation of our oled technologies and materials for possible use in commercial production 
some or all of these relationships may not succeed or  even if they are successful  may not result in the display manufacturers entering into commercial licensing and material supply relationships with us 
under our existing technology development and evaluation agreements  we are working with display manufacturers to incorporate our technologies into their products for the commercial production of oled displays 
however  these technology development and evaluation agreements typically last for limited periods of time  such that our relationships with the display manufacturers will expire unless they continually are renewed 
the display manufacturers may not agree to renew their relationships with us on a continuing basis 
in addition  we regularly continue working with display manufacturers evaluating our oled technologies and materials after our existing agreements with them have expired while we are attempting to negotiate contract extensions or new agreements with them 
should our relationships with the display manufacturers not continue or be renewed  our business would suffer 
our ability to enter into additional commercial licensing and material supply relationships  or to maintain our existing technology development and evaluation relationships  may require us to make financial or other commitments 
we might not be able  for financial or other reasons  to enter into or continue these relationships on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on us 
we rely solely on ppg industries to manufacture the oled materials we use and sell to display manufacturers 
our business prospects depend significantly on our ability to obtain proprietary oled materials for our own use and for sale to display manufacturers 
our current development and license agreement with ppg industries  inc provides us with a source for these materials for research  development and evaluation purposes  and our current supply agreement with ppg industries provides us with a source for these materials for commercial purposes 
however  the development and license agreement expires at the end of and the supply agreement expires at the end of our inability to continue obtaining these oled materials from ppg industries or another source would have a material adverse effect on our revenues from sales of these materials  as well as on our ability to perform research and development work and to support those display manufacturers currently evaluating our oled technologies and materials for possible commercial use 
if we cannot obtain and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property rights protection for our oled technologies and materials  our business will suffer 
the value of our oled technologies and materials is dependent on our ability to secure and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property rights protection 
although we own or license many patents respecting our oled technologies and materials that have already been issued  there can be no assurance that additional patents applied for will be obtained  or that any of these patents  once issued  will afford commercially significant protection for our oled technologies and materials  or will be found valid if challenged 
moreover  we have not obtained patent protection for some of our oled technologies and materials in all foreign countries in which oled displays or materials might be manufactured or sold 
in any event  the patent laws of other countries may differ from those of the united states as to the patentability of our oled technologies and materials and the degree of protection afforded 
we may become engaged in litigation to protect or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights  or in international trade commission proceedings to abate the importation of goods that would compete unfairly with those of our licensees 
in addition  we may have to participate in interference or reexamination proceedings before the us patent and trademark office  or in opposition  nullity or other proceedings before foreign patent offices  with respect to our patents or patent applications 
all of these actions would place our patents and other intellectual property rights at risk and may result in substantial costs to us as well as a diversion of management attention 
moreover  if successful  these actions could result in the loss of patent or other intellectual property rights protection for the key oled technologies and materials on which our business depends 
if our oled technologies or materials are found to infringe the rights of others  we may not be able to commercially license or sell them 
other companies and institutions may independently develop oled technologies and materials that are equivalent or superior to ours  and may obtain patent or similar rights with respect to these technologies 
there are a number of other companies and organizations that have been issued patents and are filing additional patent applications relating to oled technologies and materials  including eastman kodak company  fuji film co  ltd  canon  inc  pioneer corporation  semiconductor energy laboratories co 
and mitsubishi chemical corporation  all of whom have patent rights related to oled technologies and materials 
there can be no assurance that the utilization of our oled technologies or the sale of our oled materials  including technologies and materials developed by or licensed from princeton university  the university of southern california  ppg industries or motorola  inc  will not infringe on the patent or other intellectual property rights of others 
in this event  we or our partners may be required to obtain licenses  pay damages  modify our products or methods of operation  or be prohibited from making  using  selling or offering to sell some or all of our oled materials or products incorporating our oled technologies 
we also might not have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent infringement action  and the licensors of our licensed patents might not enforce or defend such an action in a timely manner 
if our oled materials or products incorporating our oled technologies are found to infringe on the patent or other intellectual property rights of others  it could have a material adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to license our oled technologies or to sell our oled materials to display manufacturers 
the us government has rights to our oled technologies that might prevent us from realizing the benefits of these technologies 
the us government  through various government agencies  has provided and continues to provide funding to us  princeton university and the university of southern california for research activities related to certain aspects of our oled technologies 
because we have been provided with this funding  the government has rights to these oled technologies that could restrict our ability to market them to the government for military and other applications  or to third parties for commercial applications 
moreover  if the government determines that we have not taken effective steps to achieve practical application of these oled technologies in any field of use in a reasonable time  the government could require us to grant licenses to other parties in that field of use 
any of these occurrences would limit our ability to obtain the full benefits of our oled technologies 
if we cannot keep our key employees or hire other talented persons as we grow  our business might not succeed 
our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services of senior management and other key personnel  and on our ability to offer competitive salaries and benefits to our employees 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our management or other key personnel 
additionally  competition for highly skilled technical  managerial and other personnel is intense 
we might not be able to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate the highly skilled managers and employees we need to be successful 
if we fail to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel  our business will suffer and might fail 
we can issue shares of preferred stock that may adversely affect your rights as a shareholder of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation authorize us to issue up to  shares of preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of our common stock 
for example  an issuance of shares of preferred stock could o adversely affect the voting power of the shareholders of our common stock  o make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us  o discourage bids for our common stock at a premium  or o otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our board of directors has designated and issued two series of preferred stock that were outstanding as of december  a  shares of series a nonconvertible preferred stock  all of which are held by an entity controlled by members of the family of sherwin seligsohn  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and b  shares of series b convertible preferred stock that are held by motorola

if the price of our common stock goes down  we may have to issue more shares than are presently anticipated to be issued under our agreement with ppg industries 
under our development and license agreement with ppg industries  we are required to issue to ppg industries shares of our common stock for services rendered by it 
if  at the time of issuance  the price of our common stock has declined materially since the date of the development and license agreement  we would be required to issue to ppg industries more shares of our common stock than were initially anticipated 
this increase in the number of shares available for public sale could cause people to sell our common stock  including in short sales  which could drive down the price of our common stock  thus reducing its value and perhaps hindering our ability to raise additional funds in the future 
in addition  such an increase in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock would further dilute existing holders of this stock 
our executive officers and directors own a large percentage of our common stock and could exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval  including takeover attempts

the market price of our common stock might be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock might be highly volatile  as has been the case with our common stock in the past as well as the securities of many companies  particularly other small and emerging growth companies

factors such as the following may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock in the future o our expenses and operating results  o announcements by us or our competitors of technological developments  new product applications or license arrangements  and o other factors affecting the flat panel display and related industries in general 
the issuance of additional shares of our common stock could drive down the price of our stock 
the price of our common stock can be expected to decrease if o other shares of our common stock that are currently subject to restriction on sale become freely salable  whether through an effective registration statement or based on rule under the securities act of  or o we issue additional shares of our common stock that might be or become freely salable  including shares that would be issued upon conversion of our preferred stock or the exercise of outstanding warrants and options 
our past use of arthur andersen llp as our independent auditor limits the ability of shareholders to seek potential recoveries from them related to their work 
on july   we announced that we had appointed kpmg llp to replace arthur andersen llp arthur andersen as our independent public auditor 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the years ended december  through were audited by arthur andersen 
after reasonable efforts  we were unable to obtain arthur andersen s consent to the incorporation by reference into this document of its report with respect to our financial statements 
under these circumstances  rule a under the securities act of allowed us to file this document without a written consent from arthur andersen 
the absence of this consent may limit recovery on certain claims by investors in our common stock on certain claims 
in particular  and without limitation  investors will not be able to assert claims against arthur andersen under section of the securities act of in addition  the ability of arthur andersen to satisfy any claims including claims arising from arthur andersen s provision of auditing and other services to us will be limited as a practical matter due to events regarding arthur andersen 
this means that if an investor in our common stock were to assert a claim under section of the securities act relating to its investment  that investor would not be able to seek damages from arthur andersen 
thus  as compared to a hypothetical investor in the stock of another company whose inclusion of financial statements in its annual report was consented to by that company s independent auditor  an investor in our common stock would have fewer alternatives in seeking damages relating to its investment
