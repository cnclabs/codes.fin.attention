overview sources of revenue our primary source of revenues is the acquisition and distribution of exclusive dvd programming in north america  which accounted for of our overall net sales in fiscal we market  sell and self distribute our programming to retail chains  mass merchants including clubs  video and music distributors  specialty dvd outlets  video rental chains and internet retailers 
these customers buy our new and previously released programming from our library of exclusive programming 
to a lesser extent  we also generate revenues from the domestic sales of exclusive programming in our growing cd and declining vhs formats 
we have recently entered into revenue sharing agreements with domestic video rental stores and dvd clubs  although revenue generated under those agreements has not  to date  been material 
internationally  we primarily rely on sublicensees  including bmg  to distribute our exclusive dvd content 
we receive revenues in the form of recoupable advances and royalty income 
we also rely on our exclusive sales agent nbd to sell our exclusive content for broadcast  and we receive revenues from its broadcast sales  net of sales commissions 
cost structure our most significant costs and cash expenditures relate to acquiring content for exclusive distribution and  more recently  the funding of content production or co production for exclusive distribution 
we generally base our offer of upfront royalties or for distribution agreements net profit payments on the expected success of a title s performance at retail  the actual cost of the production  and competition for the title s exclusive distribution rights 
with the popularity of dvd growing  the cost of acquiring content for exclusive distribution is also growing 
additionally  the cost of product placement  co op advertising and market development funds provided our retail customers is also increasing 
our financial focus is on achieving long term  sustainable growth and profitability 
we also seek to improve our cash flow position in order to continue licensing or entering into exclusive distribution agreements for high quality dvd and other entertainment programming and funding operations 
competition we continue to face increasing competition from major motion picture studios  music labels and other independent distribution companies for programming  retailer open to buy dollars and limited retail shelf space 
home video rights to most motion pictures are owned by major studios  record labels continue to increase titles released through their own labels  and obtaining quality dvd programming at reasonable prices is becoming more challenging 
available open to buy dollars allocated by retailers to purchase programming are becoming more scarce  since they are often devoted to high profile new releases from major studios 
our exclusive programming competes for a finite amount of shelf space  against a growing supply of entertainment programming 
we believe our expenses to provide market development funds and cooperative advertising dollars to our retail customers will continue to increase  and availability of opportunities will continue to decrease 
acquisition strategy our acquisition strategy has expanded to include dvd programming categories such as urban  youth culture lifestyle  extreme sports  comedy  and classic television programming 
we intend to maintain our focus on genres that have been successful in the past  as well as to seek out early trend opportunities in advance of mainstream acceptance in an effort to keep acquisition costs lower by bringing titles to market before spikes in demand 
for example  our success in the urban video market with titles such as thug angel  beef and jamie foxx i might need security has led to a recent multi title agreement with hip hop impresario russell simmons simmons lathan entertainment which  along with our output agreement with quincy jones iii s qd entertainment  should continue to provide us with high quality urban programming 
we also have a successful track record of releasing television programming on dvd  with our success on titles such as the twilight zone  the richard pryor show and the dick van dyke show resulting in new opportunities to release popular television shows such as pee wee s playhouse  combat  saved by the bell the college years and the nick jessica variety hour 
our comedy titles include stand up comedy shows for both the dvd and broadcast markets  including new shows from comedians larry the cable guy and a classic show from jeff foxworthy  and upcoming shows from bill engvall and ron white 
collectively  these blue collar comedians represent millions of audio cds sold through third party labels  one of the biggest comedy tours of all time in  and a recently announced network tv series for the group 
multi title deals with national lampoon and jamie foxx s laffapalooza series should also drive future new release sales in this genre 
our music dvd business should remain robust in an increasingly competitive market  with upcoming releases from macy gray  the ramones  mc  the vans warped tour and dion 
other new initiatives include the development of multi cultural niches including latin hispanic product  asian titles such as hong kong cinema and japanese anime animation  and bollywood films from india 
we are also seeking to expand our sales of audio cd programming  with titles such as show me how by lorrie morgan  the cast album of the grammy nominated broadway musical nine  starring antonio banderas  this year s cast album of fiddler on the roof  starring alfred molina  the cast album for stephen sondheim s multi tony award winning assassins  ronnie milsap live  the live at billy bob s texas country music series  and audio soundtrack companions to our video releases 
we also recently signed an agreement with the source magazine to distribute their hip hop hits series  as well as the th anniversary of hip hop 
sales and marketing initiatives in order to deal with increasing competition more effectively  we are developing new marketing initiatives  including revenue growth related incentives to encourage retailers to carry our titles 
we are also adjusting our price points on new release programming and selectively repricing and repositioning our secondary and tertiary catalogue programming  which  when coupled with specific promotions  should help to drive revenues 
for example  while retailers are sometimes hesitant to bring in new individual titles  we believe they are more receptive to newly designed box sets 
these compilations have a higher perceived value among retailers and consumers  making both shelf space and retail sales easier to obtain 
repackaging existing product in this manner also typically creates higher margins 
accordingly  we have created and released additional box sets to better exploit our existing catalogue  such as the endless summer collection 
other box sets scheduled for upcoming release include a newly remastered collection of rod serling s classic television series the twilight zone  windows media high definition remastered titles originally created for exhibition in imax theaters  and cult horror favorites from the something weird collection 
we will continue seeking high quality programming to market and distribute in all genres

the increase was primarily due to the growth in fiscal fourth quarter exclusive revenues over fiscal at march   our cash on hand was down to  as compared to million at march   while our net receivables were higher 
at march   our royalties and distribution fee advances and inventory balances are comparable to those at march  capital expenditures were approximately million for fiscal  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we incurred expenditures for distribution system enhancements  information technology infrastructure improvements and oracle financial and order management modules 
our working capital currently comes from two sources operating cash flows  and availability under our revolving line of credit and term loan facilities with wells fargo foothill  inc at march   we had cash of  and borrowing availability of  and  respectively  under our revolving credit and term loan facilities with foothill 
our working capital requirements vary primarily with the level of our program acquisition  production and distribution activities 
recurring principal uses of working capital in our operations are for acquiring exclusive programming royalty payments  including advance payment against future royalties to program suppliers  advance payments under exclusive distribution agreements  music publishing payments  manufacturing and production costs  costs of acquiring finished programming for exclusive distribution  selling  general and administrative expenses and debt service 
availability of sufficient working capital is a substantial factor in our ability to acquire popular new programming upon which our continued success depends 
therefore  maximizing available working capital is critical to our business operations 
we face increasing competition in securing exclusive rights from other independent distribution companies as well as major motion picture studios and music labels 
without sufficient working capital  we may not be able to remain competitive with advance offers from competitors who are willing to pay more or who have greater financial resources 
we will continue to focus on effectively managing our capital resources and seeking appropriate financing in order to acquire rights to the programming we desire in order to fully execute on our growth plans 
in order to most efficiently manage our cash flow  we strive to conservatively value the sales potential of a given title by polling retailers  comparing like titles  quantifying the relevance of the content and generally summarizing the sales potential based on our experience and expertise 
by identifying trends in advance  keeping acquisition costs in line with sales projections  and avoiding higher profile shows whose owners demand excessive advances  we seek to focus our limited resources on acquiring and promoting opportunities that will be profitable and produce a continued revenue stream upon recoupment 
we believe that projected cash flows from operations  borrowing availability under our revolving line of credit  cash on hand  and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to meet our projected cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
should we be in a position to acquire significantly higher profile content or library of content for exclusive distribution  or should we find an attractive synergistic corporate acquisition  we would need to seek additional debt or equity financing in order fund the transactions 
we believe any such financing could come in the form of vendor debt financing or convertible debt  convertible preferred stock or straight equity issuance through a private investment in public equity investor  however there are no assurances that such financing would be available  or available on terms acceptable or favorable to us 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at march   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands contractual obligations payments due by period thereafter total long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations licensing and exclusive distribution agreements employment agreements total advances and guarantees included in the table above  under licensing and exclusive distribution agreements  are recoupable against future royalties and distribution fees earned by our exclusive program suppliers in connection with revenues generated by those rights 
as we have historically  we expect to fund these commitments through recoupment of existing advances  existing bank lines of credit  and other working capital 
we do not expect our obligations for property and equipment expenditures  including information technology related expenditures  to exceed million per year 
lease guarantee 
in connection with the asset sale of dvdplanet  planet entertainment assumed the obligations under dvdplanet s leases for its retail store and various other liabilities related to the assets being acquired and its parent infinity resources guaranteed planet entertainment s obligations 
we remain a guarantor in the event that planet entertainment and infinity default on their financial obligations under the lease 
the remaining payments under the lease total approximately  through december long term debt 
long term debt at march  and march   consisted of the following in thousands march  march  subordinated note payable ritek taiwan note payable to bank current portion of long term debt long term debt less current portion other debt instruments and related covenants 
our loan agreements with foothill require us to comply with minimum financial and operating covenants 
we received consecutive waivers of our noncompliance with financial covenants contained in our revolving credit and term loan facilities as of and for the quarters ended june  september  and december  the waivers of our noncompliance were for failing to meet a minimum quarterly ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined in the loan agreement and a minimum tangible net worth  as defined 
our failure to meet the covenant minimums was primarily due to the negative impact of dvdplanet operations and loss on its sale  the negative impact upon consolidated financial performance of the slower than expected transition of european distribution of our exclusive programming to bmg  intense competition  and losses during the nine months ended december  at our request  foothill waived our compliance with both covenants for prior periods and  effective as of december   amended our loan and security agreement dated december   as follows the tangible net worth covenant was redefined  decreasing the minimum required levels that we must maintain quarterly  and the ebitda covenant was redefined  decreasing the minimum required levels measured on a stand alone quarterly basis 
at march   again at our request  foothill further amended the minimum stand alone quarterly ebitda covenant changing the measurement to a cumulative quarterly minimum level 
the quarterly ebitda minimums  as amended in december  were not changed 
the first ebitda measurement was for the march quarter 
the second will be for the six months ending june  the third will be for the nine months ending september  the fourth will be for the twelve months ending december  thereafter  the measurement will be a rolling twelve months ebitda 
as of march   we were in compliance with all covenants  as amended  and believe that we will be able to achieve the minimum requirements going forward 
in the event of any future covenant noncompliance  however  should foothill not provide a waiver  our outstanding borrowings would become immediately due and the default would cause cross default on other debt agreements 
we believe that we would be able to secure replacement asset based financing should this occur  but can give no assurance that we would be successful  or that  if successful  the terms would be as favorable 
relocation of company headquarters 
on january   we entered into a new corporate office lease to relocate our two existing corporate office facilities totaling  square feet located in chatsworth  california 
the new office facility consists of approximately  square feet in a multi tenant building in chatsworth 
the initial cost of the new office space is per square foot on a gross basis and increases approximately annually 
the new office lease has an initial year term with two five year options 
the start date of the new lease will be around july   when the landlord is expected to complete the approximately million in tenant improvements for which the landlord is responsible  except for a potential  charge which is currently under discussion 
our existing office leases at oso avenue and oso avenue terminate on july   and august   respectively 
the rent for our current office space is per square foot on a triple net basis  which has equated to approximately to 
per square foot on a gross basis over the prior two fiscal years 
accordingly  our cash outlay will initially increase by approximately  per month above current costs  including rent for the increased square footage  utilities  insurance  taxes  building and common area maintenance 
we anticipate that relocation related expenses such as cabling and wiring  furniture  computers  phone system will be approximately million  which will be capitalized to the extent allowable by us gaap and amortized over the useful life of the related assets  or the lease term if a leasehold improvement and if the lease term is shorter than the useful life of the improvement 
we are currently attempting to finance a portion of these costs under our capital expenditures facility with foothill 
infrastructure improvements 
during the year ended march   we made significant investments in information technology personnel  hardware  software and consulting services 
much of our capital expenditures have been used in connection with two information technology initiatives 
the first has been the replacement of our aging  legacy qantel applications system with oracle enterprise applications software to improve scalability  security  internal controls  integration  reporting and provide the ability to enhance our business processes 
we successfully converted our finance  purchasing and inventory control systems in november the cumulative cost to implement the initial phase of oracle applications including software cost totaled approximately  over the last two fiscal years through may to complete the migration to oracle  we are working to convert existing order management and production creative services tracking systems by late calendar we expect the final phase of the migration to oracle to cost approximately  primarily in consulting fees  of which  has been spent through may we expect to finance these expenditures through working capital and our existing bank line of credit 
the second initiative has been technology infrastructure 
expenditures towards improvements in system security  policies procedures  email  file storage and networking will continue through we are also automating returns processing operations in our las vegas distribution center 
coordinated investments in hardware  software and consulting services are being applied with the goal of reducing labor costs  increasing customer service and streamlining operating procedures related to returns processing 
we expect this initiative to cost approximately  and be completed in through may  we have spent  of this total 
we were unable to finance these expenditures through bank of america in nevada due to the high proportion of soft costs such as consulting fees 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
significant sources of working capital for fiscal retirement of iic convertible subordinated note payable 
in march  we reached an agreement with image investors co 
iic to retire early the remaining balance due under our convertible subordinated note payable to iic with a combination of cash and common stock 
iic is our largest shareholder  and is owned and controlled by john w 
kluge and stuart subotnick 
to retire the obligation early  we paid  in cash  plus accrued interest of  we issued  shares of our common stock at per share to satisfy the remaining  in principal due 
in connection with the partial conversion of the balance due under the note into common stock  we issued iic a five year warrant to purchase up to  more shares at per share 
the warrant has been exercisable since march  the restricted stock will be unregistered and subject to rule under the securities act of  as amended 
iic will have limited registration rights 
we recorded a charge of  as a component of other expenses  in the accompanying statement of operations for fiscal for the estimated fair value of the warrant valued using the black scholes valuation model royalty advance from bmg 
under the january agreement with bmg  we received a million royalty advance in march  fully recoupable by bmg against quarterly royalties due under the agreement 
see transition of international sales to bmg below 
we used the funds to pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with foothill 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from those estimates 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that involve significant uncertainties  require judgments or estimates that are more difficult for management to determine or that may produce materially different results when using different assumptions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon meeting all the recognition requirements of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting by producers or distributors of films and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from home video distribution  net of an allowance for estimated returns  as well as related costs  in the period in which the product is available for sale by our customers at the point that title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  which is generally upon receipt by the customer  and in the case of new releases after street date restrictions lapse 
we recognize revenues from domestic and international broadcast licensing and home video sublicensing  as well as associated costs  when the programming is available to the licensee and other recognition requirements of sop are met 
we defer fees received in advance of availability  usually in the case of advances received from bmg  other international sublicensees and for programming broadcast  until other revenue recognition requirements have been satisfied 
in all instances  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable are provided at the time of sale 
as of march   deferred revenue totaled  royalty and distribution fee advances for each reporting period  we estimate the total revenues to be received throughout a title s exclusive license or distribution period from exploitation of that title in multiple home entertainment formats 
while we charge royalty and distribution fee advances to operations as related revenues are earned  estimates of ultimate revenues are important in determining whether we should record additional royalty and distribution fee expense as cost of sales in any given reporting period 
we amortize royalty and distribution fee advances to expense in the same ratio that the current period revenues for a title or group of titles bear to the estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenues for that title 
additionally  in circumstances required by sop  we recognize additional amortization to the extent that capitalized advance royalty and distribution fees exceed their estimated fair value in the period when estimated 
we base our estimates of ultimate revenue for each title on the historical performance of that title and of similar titles 
we update such estimates based upon the actual results of each format s exploitation 
estimates of ultimate revenues on a title by title basis are subject to substantial uncertainty 
factors affecting future actual performance include focus from the sales and marketing department including advertising  promotions and price reductions  availability of retail shelf space  retail customer product placement and advertising  maintenance of adequate inventory levels  concert touring by the artist in the case of music dvds and cds  retail sell through  and ultimately continued end use consumer demand 
overestimation of ultimate revenues would cause unamortized costs to be amortized at a slower rate or a delay in adjusting costs to their fair value until such time estimates are reduced  causing unamortized costs to be overstated and increased amortization of costs in a later period 
underestimation of ultimate revenues would cause unamortized costs to be amortized more quickly until ultimate revenue estimates are increased  causing unamortized costs to be understated and decreased amortization of costs in a later period 
inventory valuation for each reporting period  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by title and by format  and projections of future demand 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete or overstocked 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost or market value  and result in a new basis in such inventory until sold 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory writedowns may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
future demand will be dependent upon the continued retail customer acceptance of the programming  future demand by end use consumer  unplanned future promotions  market conditions either favorable or unfavorable and future warehouse storage limitations 
should projections of future inventory demand be overstated  the value of inventory would be overstated and current cost of sales understated with future cost of sales overstated 
conversely  should projections of future demand be understated  the value of inventory would be understated and the current cost of sales overstated with future cost of sales understated 
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts receivable for each reporting period  we evaluate product sales and accounts receivable to estimate their effect on revenues due to product returns and delinquent accounts 
our estimates of product sales that will be returned and the amount of receivables that will ultimately be collected require the exercise of judgment  and affect reported revenues and net earnings 
in determining the estimate of product sales that will be returned  we analyze historical returns quantity of returns and time to receive returned product  historical pricing and other credit memo data  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products  including reorder activity 
based on this information  we reserve a percentage of each dollar of product sales where the customer has the right to return such product and receive either a pricing or credit memo 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 
estimates of future sales returns and other credits are subject to substantial uncertainty 
factors affecting actual returns include retailer financial difficulties  the perception of comparatively poor retail performance in one or several retailer locations  limited retail shelf space at various times of the year  inadequate advertising or promotions  retail prices being too high for the perceived quality of the content  the near term release of similar titles  and poor responses to package designs 
underestimation of product sales returns and other credits would result in an overstatement of current revenues and lower revenues in future periods 
conversely  overestimation of product sales returns would result in an understatement of current revenues and higher revenues in future periods 
similarly  we evaluate accounts receivables to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgments and estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for our larger customers and an analysis of the length of time receivables have been past due 
based on the information  we reserve an amount that we believe to be doubtful of collection 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsened  additional allowances may be required in the future 
underestimation of this allowance would cause accounts receivable to be overstated and current period expenses to be understated 
overestimation of this allowance would cause accounts receivable to be understated and current period expenses to be overstated 
valuation of deferred income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that it is more likely than not that all  or a portion  of such deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the establishment  or increase  of a valuation allowance increases income tax expense for such year 
discontinued operations sale of dvdplanet on september   our wholly owned subsidiary dvdplanet sold substantially all of its assets  marking our departure from the direct to consumer retail distribution business 
in fiscal  we incurred a loss of  on the sale  and we expensed approximately  in severance related compensation liability in connection with the sale 
as of march   our remaining liability for severance related compensation is  and will be paid in equal monthly installments through december dvdplanet s business did not meet our financial objectives 
the dvdplanet asset sale allows us to focus on our core business  which has a stronger potential to increase our exclusive programming revenues and reach our near term goal of consistent profitability 
unless otherwise noted  the remainder of this md a relates only to results from continuing operations 
all periods presented reflect the classification of dvdplanet s financial results as discontinued operations 
establishment of valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets during our third quarter ended december   we established a valuation allowance against of our net deferred tax assets  which are composed primarily of net operating loss nol carryforwards  resulting in the recording of an income tax expense equal to the net deferred tax assets as of march  the valuation allowance was recorded in the third quarter primarily as a result of operating losses sustained during our normally seasonally strong third quarter as well as its then expected impact on the full fiscal year results of operations 
income tax expense relating to our establishment of a valuation allowance totaled  for the year ended march  even though we have fully reserved these net deferred tax assets for book purposes  we would still be able to utilize them to reduce future income taxes payable  should we have future earnings 
to the extent such deferred tax assets relate to nol carryforwards  the ability to use such nols against future earnings will be subject to applicable carryforward periods 
transition of international sales to bmg as of march   we substantially completed our international transition from various local  third party international subdistributors to bmg music international service  gmbh bmg 
beginning in march for new releases and april for catalogue programming  bmg commenced distribution of our programming throughout the same and some additional european territories under a sublicense agreement 
although comparative revenues are primarily lower as a result of the accounting under this new distribution arrangement described below  we no longer have the expenses associated with direct distribution to the european territories  such as manufacturing packaging  shipping  music publishing  selling and advertising expenses and several salaries for full time employees previously dedicated to our former international efforts 
bmg has strategically reintroduced our programming throughout the european territories to ultimately maximize sales  and management believes our available programming is fully represented for sale throughout the european territories 
we received a million initial royalty advance under the bmg agreement in march  fully recoupable from revenues generated by bmg against quarterly royalties due to image under the agreement 
based upon actual quarterly sales of our programming in the territories  bmg recoups quarterly royalties from the million previously advanced 
bmg provides additional quarterly royalty advances such that for the first three years of the agreement term  the outstanding royalty advance to image at any given time will be a constant million 
we used the million initially received to pay down our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
during the first three quarters of the fourth year of the term  bmg will reduce  through recoupment  the outstanding royalty advance to million 
once the entire royalty advance is recouped  bmg will continue to pay quarterly royalties based on revenue generated 
during the fourth quarter of the fourth year  bmg may recoup the entire remaining balance of million by not re advancing royalties quarterly 
the agreement contains a formula to pay an additional lesser advance at the beginning of the fifth and final year of the term which is to be recouped by bmg during that year 
we must repay any outstanding unrecouped royalty advance within days following the final bmg reporting at the conclusion of bmg s sell off period after expiration of the five year term  but at this time we do not expect any such unrecouped balance 
our accounting for international revenues differs under the bmg agreement because revenues are generated under a sublicense agreement  rather than the subdistribution agreements previously in place 
under our previous subdistribution agreements  we recorded net revenues based upon the selling price of its programming sold to our distribution network customers 
we recorded as cost of sales  the actual manufacturing packaging cost  shipping cost  royalties distribution fees and music publishing 
under the bmg agreement  we record royalty income as revenue based upon royalties we receive from bmg 
revenue is recorded in the period in which the product is sold by bmg 
we report as cost of goods sold the royalties or distribution fees we owe our licensors or program suppliers as calculated against the royalties we receive from bmg 
the majority of international selling and marketing expenses are now borne by bmg 
additionally  bmg is responsible for manufacturing and packaging costs as well as music publishing 
results of operations revenue over of consolidated net revenues were generated from the sale of dvd programming 
based on consumer buying trends in the industry  we anticipate that our sales of vhs will continue to decline  and our sales of dvd and cd will continue to rise 
the following table presents consolidated net revenues by reportable business segment for the years ended march   and  respectively change change in thousands in thousands net revenues domestic international consolidated fiscal compared to domestic revenue the increase in domestic net revenues for the year ended march   was primarily due to the comparative strength of our exclusive dvd programming  offset almost entirely by a combination of reduced nonexclusive dvd revenues  reduced vhs revenues  increased market development funds provided customers recorded as a reduction of revenues in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products and an increased allowance for sales returns and credits  as compared to fiscal the increase in our allowance for sales returns and credits in fiscal was due in part to a change in our customer mix which has increased the lag time between sale and return 
international revenue the reduction in international net revenues is primarily a result of the change in our method of european distribution  specifically transitioning international distribution of our exclusive programming from local subdistributors to bmg through our sublicense 
in the prior fiscal years  revenue was recorded at the higher selling price to our subdistributors 
during fiscal  we recorded the lower royalty income received from bmg as our revenues 
in addition  during fiscal  bmg strategically reintroduced our programming throughout its territories in an effort ultimately to maximize revenues 
all of our dvd programming is now fully represented within bmg territories 
our ability to continue to acquire programming that will be successful internationally will have a direct effect on future international revenue growth 
as long as we continue to supply bmg and our other sublicensees with commercially successful programming  and as bmg becomes more adept with our product catalogue  we believe our international revenues will grow 
broadcast sales decreased to  for the year ended march   compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
we continue to place less of an emphasis on acquiring broadcast rights for music programming  due to the high cost of music clearance in relation to the fees broadcasters are willing to pay to air the programming 
fiscal compared to domestic revenue we primarily attribute the growth in domestic revenues in fiscal to continued unit sales growth of our dvd catalogue and the overall growth in dvd s popularity 
international revenue the reduction in comparative international net revenues was primarily due to an additional allowance for sales returns recorded for then estimated subdistributor returns as a result of the impending change of european distribution from a network of independent subdistributors to bmg 
although broadcast revenues were higher in fiscal than  we began to place less of an emphasis on broadcast rights

fiscal compared to domestic gross margins the reduction in domestic gross margins for fiscal was primarily due to increased charges to segment cost of sales from increased amortization of royalty advances and adjustments to fair value as a result of lower ultimate revenue forecasts for some of our exclusive programming 
additionally  the increased market development funds we provide to our retail customers  recorded by us as a reduction to revenues  and writedowns of some inventory titles to the lower of cost or market value  also contributed to the decrease in segment gross margins 
we are establishing a dedicated group within our sales department to focus exclusively on our extensive library of previously released programming in an effort to increase catalogue revenues in fiscal international gross margins gross margins as a percentage of net revenues for our international segment decreased for fiscal royalties and distribution fees accrued to program suppliers on sublicense and broadcast revenues are higher than those on subdistribution revenues 
for fiscal  gross margins were not only generated from sublicense and broadcast revenues  but also from subdistribution revenues 
cost of sales of this segment in fiscal was primarily impacted by fluctuations in the royalties and distribution fees  the primary components of fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales for this segment in fiscal was impacted not only by fluctuations in royalties and distribution fees  but also by manufacturing costs  music publishing fees and market development funds provided to subdistributors for marketing

international gross margins gross margins for our international segment increased by for fiscal as compared to the prior year 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment writedown of  for the advance royalties paid for the international distribution rights to a line of programming 
the writedown was to the estimated fair value based on lower revised estimated ultimate revenues 
fiscal gross margins were negatively affected by adjustments resulting from the change in our method of international video distribution 
we expensed approximately  to cost of sales for additional sales returns we expect to receive from subdistributors as well as a charge to cost of sales of  for inventory lower of cost or market writedowns 
also  contributing to lower fiscal gross margins were nonaccountable advertising and promotional allowances offered to our international subdistributors during fiscal we recorded these allowances as a reduction of net revenues in accordance with eitf during fiscal  advertising and promotional expenses were only deducted from purchases after review and approval by the company and  accordingly  were classified as selling expenses rather than a reduction of revenues

we expect advertising and promotional expenditures to continue to increase  as retailers insist on marketing support for our programming once they have committed to purchasing it 
print and co op advertising are all increasingly important to creating consumer awareness of our products 
the likelihood of placing product in significant quantity is enhanced with a convincing outlay of marketing funds to increase product awareness and sales 
it is common and increasingly more necessary to spend from seventy cents to in excess of one dollar per unit in order to effectively promote the availability of a higher profile title at retail 
international selling expenses international selling expenses for fiscal were lower than fiscal primarily due to expense savings from the closing of the offices of aviva international  llc  our controlled joint venture that ceased operations at the end of our third fiscal quarter ended december  additional segment expense reductions came from the repurposing of employees previously classified as international selling to the program acquisitions and business development department  classified as general and administrative expenses 
we have significantly reduced marketing and promotion expenditures during fiscal as a result of the bmg sublicense agreement 
the majority of expenses relating to international dvd selling activities  including marketing and promotion which were our expenses in fiscal  were borne by bmg as our sublicensee for fiscal fiscal compared to domestic selling expenses several of the more significant factors contributing to the increase in absolute dollar domestic segment selling expenses for fiscal  as compared to fiscal are as follows image incurred  higher personnel costs from adding regional sales personnel and exclusive brand managers during fiscal as well as annual salary increases 
the regional sales managers were added to seek new customer accounts and more efficiently handle specific territories 
the exclusive brand managers were added to focus on marketing specific brands we exclusively acquire and distribute 
the increase in selling expenses for fiscal was partially offset by a  reduction in annual advertising expense 
our advertising expenditures  on a specific title and line of programming basis  depend on the titles in release and the programs created by the marketing department 
international selling expenses selling expenses for our international segment decreased for fiscal  and as a percentage of segment net revenues  selling expenses were down by from fiscal we incurred reduced expenses generated by aviva totaling  primarily from lower personnel costs and trade show related expenses

accordingly  related increased personnel costs of approximately  previously classified as international segment selling and general and administrative expenses and domestic selling expenses  are now included in this domestic segment general and administrative expenses 
we also increased our personnel costs including recruitment  consulting and temporary labor expenses in our accounting and finance departments to handle the increased workload associated with the accounting and reporting requirements of the exclusive distribution agreements added during the current year as well as in the area of credit and collections 
we incurred higher general and administrative expenses in these areas during fiscal as compared to fiscal as follows accounting and finance department personnel costs of  additional headcount  outside labor  including consulting and recruitment  of  we have incurred increased across the board insurance premium costs  which were higher by  for the year ended march   and increased legal expenses  primarily associated with our efforts to protect our rights to our exclusive programming from infringers  which were higher by  for the year ended march  the increased expenses described above as well as general wage increases of  were the primary reasons for the increase in segment general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  the trend of higher segment general and administrative expenses is expected to continue for the foreseeable future due to the nature of our initiatives

income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that it is more likely than not that all  or a portion  of such deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the establishment  or increase  of a valuation allowance increases income tax expense for such year 
in assessing the realizability of a deferred tax asset  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires that all available evidence  both positive and negative  be considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 
sfas no 
further provides that cumulative losses in recent years are significant pieces of negative evidence to overcome when determining whether it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized in the future by reducing future income taxes payable 
such cumulative losses from prior years must be considered on a pretax consolidated basis from all operations 
in addition to current year pretax losses for both continuing and discontinued operations  we also incurred aggregate net pretax losses for fiscal years and accordingly  during the current fiscal year we established a valuation allowance against of our net deferred tax assets  which are composed primarily of operating loss carryforwards  resulting in a current year tax expense of  the valuation allowance was recorded in the third quarter primarily as a result of operating losses sustained during our normally seasonally strong third quarter as well as its then expected impact on the full fiscal year results of operations 
even though we have fully reserved our net deferred tax assets for book purposes  we would still be able to utilize them to reduce future income taxes payable  should we have future earnings 
to the extent such deferred tax assets relate to nol carryforwards  the ability to use such nols against future earnings will be subject to applicable carryforward periods 
we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of  for fiscal year included as a component of income tax expense is a provision for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of  the valuation allowance fully reserved foreign tax credit carryforwards which have a year carryforward period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations 
at march   approximately million of our outstanding borrowings are subject to changes in interest rates  however  we do not use derivatives to manage this risk 
this exposure is linked to the prime rate and libor 
we believe that moderate changes in the prime rate or libor would not materially affect the operating results or financial condition of the company 
for example  a change in interest rates would result in an approximate  annual impact on pretax income loss based upon those outstanding borrowings at march  foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
at march   approximately  of our accounts receivable related to international distribution and were denominated in foreign currencies subject to future foreign exchange rate risk 
we distribute some of our licensed dvd and vhs programming for which we have international distribution rights internationally through international subdistributors and sublicensees 
additionally  we exploit international broadcast rights to our licensed entertainment programming for which we have international broadcast rights 
we believe that moderate changes in the foreign exchange rates will not materially affect our operation results or financial condition 
for example  a change in exchange rates would result in an approximate  impact on pretax income loss based upon those outstanding receivables at march  to date  we have not entered into foreign currency exchange contracts
