critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
table of contents the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by the company 
financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to various market risks  including certain livestock  interest rates  grain and feed costs  natural gas and other commodities used in the normal course of operations 
the company may also hold positions for which hedge accounting  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as amended  is not applied 
derivative financial instruments must be marked to market as of the end of each quarter in which the positions exist 
as the commodities underlying the company s derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations  any requirement to mark to market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 
could result in volatility in the company s results of operations 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s 
contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to wage and hour labor  livestock procurement  securities  environmental  product  taxing authorities and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
these reserves may change in the future due to changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond the company s control 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accrued self insurance insurance expense for health and welfare  workers compensation  auto liability and general liability risks are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
the assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management 
however  actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s market risks market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
to address certain of these risks  the company enters into various derivative transactions as described below 
if a derivative instrument is a hedge  as defined by sfas no 
 as amended  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the instrument will be either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of an instrument s change in fair value  as defined by sfas no 
 as amended  will be immediately recognized in earnings as a component of cost of sales 
additionally  the company holds certain positions  primarily in grain and livestock futures which do not meet the criteria for sfas no 
hedge accounting 
these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date 
the changes in market value of derivatives used in the company s risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales 
the changes in market value of derivatives used in the company s risk management activities surrounding forward sales contracts are recorded in sales 
the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities 
sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions management may take to mitigate the company s exposure to changes  nor do they consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity 
actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 
commodities risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  such as corn  soybeans  livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations 
the company uses commodity futures to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity 
however  as the commodities underlying the company s derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations  any requirement to mark to market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 
could result in volatility in the company s results of operations 
generally  contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation 
contracts that are designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting 
the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of in market prices as of october   and september   respectively  on fair value of open positions 
the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices 
the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and non hedge positions
