item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading less than truckload multi regional motor carrier providing timely one to five day service among five regions in the united states and next day and second day service within these regions 
through our four branded product groups  od domestic  od expedited  od global and od technology  we offer an expanding array of innovative products and services 
at year end  we provided full state coverage to of the states that we serve directly within the southeast  south central  northeast  midwest and west regions of the country 
through marketing and carrier relationships  we also provide service to and from the remaining states as well as international services around the globe 
we plan to increase our direct coverage to states and our full state coverage to states in the first half of  as we continue to expand our markets 
historically  over of our revenue is derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers  whose demand for our services is generally tied to the overall health of the us domestic economy 
we combine the rapid transit times of a regional carrier with the geographic coverage of an inter regional carrier 
we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors and we are highly competitive with our principal regional competition 
in analyzing the components of our revenue  we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight this measurement reflects our pricing policies  which are influenced by competitive market conditions and our growth strategies 
changes in the class  packaging of the freight and length of haul of the shipment can also affect this average  as light  bulky freight will be priced at higher revenue per hundredweight levels than dense freight 
ltl weight per ltl shipment fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the class  or mix  of freight we receive from our customers as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment 
generally  increases in ltl weight per ltl shipment indicate higher demand for our customers products and overall increased economic activity 
average length of haul we consider lengths of haul less than miles to be regional traffic  lengths of haul between miles and  miles to be inter regional traffic  and lengths of haul in excess of  miles to be national traffic 
by segmenting our revenue into lengths of haul  we can determine our market share and the growth potential of our service products in those markets 
ltl revenue per ltl shipment this measurement is primarily determined by the three metrics listed above and is used  in conjunction with the number of ltl shipments we receive  to calculate total ltl revenue 
our primary revenue focus is to increase shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure  generally referred to as increased density  thereby maximizing asset utilization and labor productivity 
we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center  linehaul load factor  pickup and delivery p d stops per hour  p d shipments per hour and platform pounds per hour 
we believe continued improvement in density is a key component in our ability to sustain profitable growth 
the majority of direct costs associated with our business are driver and service center wages and benefits  operating supplies and expenses  and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities 
we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio  a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue  which also allows industry wide comparisons with our competition 
we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs 
this technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our systems  while providing key metrics from which we can monitor our processes 
we believe our non union workforce gives us a significant advantage over our unionized ltl competition 
advantages of our workforce include flexible hours and the ability of our employees to perform multiple tasks  which we believe result in greater productivity  customer service  efficiency and cost savings 
we focus on communication and the continued education  development and motivation of our employees to ensure that our relationships remain excellent 
market fluctuations in the cost of key components of our cost structure  such as diesel fuel affect our profitability 
our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels 
we are also subject to market changes in insurance rates  and we continue to evaluate our balance of excess insurance coverage and self insurance to minimize that cost 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations revenue from operations salaries  wages and benefits purchased transportation operating supplies and expenses depreciation and amortization building and office equipment rents operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims communication and utilities general supplies and expenses miscellaneous expenses  net total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to we produced a increase in revenue in coupled with a increase in net income for the year 
revenue increased to  from  in  our second consecutive year of double digit revenue growth and the eleventh in the thirteen years since our initial public offering in our operating ratio decreased to from and net income for was  compared to  in most of our growth in can be attributed to market share gains in existing areas of our operations  which increased our density and resulted in lower incremental operating costs 
revenue per service center increased  despite opening additional service centers in these openings accounted for less that of our increase in revenue in  but enabled us to offer full state coverage to all points in arkansas  louisiana and missouri and increase our full state coverage from to of the states in which we provide direct service 
our ltl shipments increased over and ltl tonnage increased  both indicators of increased market share and an improving domestic economy 
we also continued to benefit from the september   bankruptcy of consolidated freightways  a major national ltl carrier and one of our competitors 
our average length of haul increased to miles from in  which is consistent with the longer haul freight that became available after the closure of consolidated freightways 
ltl revenue per ltl shipment increased to from in  an increase of 
this was due to a combination of a increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight  partially offset by a 
decrease in weight per shipment 
approximately of our revenue is generated from public tariffs  which are generally reviewed on an annual basis with the most recent general price increase occurring on july  the remaining revenue base is generated from contractual agreements  typically one to two years in length  which are renegotiated as they near expiration 
while the average ltl weight per ltl shipment was lower in  we have seen consecutive monthly increases in this measurement since april and we believe this is yet another indicator of an improving economic climate as our customers are moving larger shipments through our network 
our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels 
this surcharge is recorded as additional revenue and is intended to offset significant fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel  which is one of the larger components of our operating supplies and expenses 
because of average higher fuel prices in  the fuel surcharge increased to of revenue from in the market share increases we experienced in generated operating efficiencies and productivity gains throughout our operations  which is reflected in a decrease in our operating ratio to from in the benefits of increased freight density was particularly evident in the reduction in salaries  wages and benefits  which decreased to of revenue in from in p d wages decreased to of revenue from in a portion of these savings resulted from the rollout of our driver hand held computers  which was completed by year end these handheld computers provide direct communication between our drivers  service center personnel and other old dominion systems  which results in more efficient routings of our p d fleet and increased productivity 
for the comparable years  p d shipments handled per hour increased and p d wages per shipment decreased slightly  despite an average hourly wage increase of approximately 
platform wages decreased to of revenue in from for the prior year 
this reduction was due to increased dock productivity partially due to the implementation of our dock yard management system at most of our major facilities by year end this system utilizes barcode technology to improve freight visibility throughout our systems and allow for faster and more efficient handling of freight 
ltl weight per platform hour and ltl shipments per platform hour  both measures of dock productivity  increased and  respectively  in while platform wages per ltl hundredweight increased only against an average hourly wage increase of reductions in p d and platform wages were partially offset by an increase in linehaul wages to of revenue from in linehaul miles increased  due to increased business levels and a longer average length of haul  and average linehaul wages per mile increased 
slight improvements in our linehaul load factor  the weight of shipments loaded onto trailers for each linehaul dispatch  was not sufficient to offset these additional costs 
our fringe benefit costs increased to of payroll in from for the prior year due primarily to increases in workers compensation expenses 
we self insure workers compensation claims in a range between  and  depending upon the plan year and the state in which we are operating 
we also carry excess coverage for claims in excess of these deductibles 
in  the combination of claims expense and insurance premiums was of payroll compared to in  primarily due to anticipated settlement costs for our self insured portion 
diesel fuel costs  excluding fuel taxes  increased over due to a increase in consumption and increased costs per gallon 
we currently do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments  therefore  we are subject to market price fluctuations 
we believe that our fuel surcharges  which decrease or are eliminated as fuel prices approach base levels  have effectively offset the increases in diesel fuel prices in net capital expenditures in were  which included  for purchases of tractors and trailers in addition to  for purchases of service center facilities or capital improvements to existing service center facilities 
these capital expenditures included the purchase of eleven service center facilities auctioned as a result of the september bankruptcy of consolidated freightways 
as a result  depreciation and amortization expenses increased to of revenue from in as these properties replaced leased facilities  our building and office equipment rents decreased to of revenue from for the prior year 
insurance and claims expense  primarily consisting of premiums and self insured costs for auto liability and cargo claims  decreased to of revenue in compared to in premiums for excess coverage above our self insured retention levels generally increased over the prior year as a percentage of revenue 
these additional costs were offset by favorable claims experience in our self insured retention for both auto liability and cargo claims  resulting in a decline in our overall insurance costs in our revenue growth and density improvements in allowed us to successfully leverage other costs  including communication and utilities  general supplies and expenses  and miscellaneous expenses  which as a group declined to of revenue from in expenses for uncollectible revenue  a component of miscellaneous expenses  decreased to 
of revenue from 
in interest expense for  net of interest income  increased to  from  in by year end  we borrowed  on our line of credit and an additional  on other debt instruments  however  we made principal payments of  on outstanding debt during the year  resulting in net borrowings of  for since average outstanding debt remained relatively constant for the comparable years  the increase in interest expense can be attributed to the decrease in the amount of interest that was capitalized in  which was  compared to  in our effective tax rate for was compared to in compared to in  we achieved double digit revenue growth  improved our operating efficiencies and increased our earnings at a faster rate than revenue growth 
we achieved these objectives  even while the us economy remained sluggish throughout the year  primarily by implementing our strategy of growing revenue in our existing areas of operation and improving asset utilization 
revenue for increased to  compared to  in our operating ratio improved to from  and net income improved to  for  or over net income for of  our revenue growth strategy was based upon increasing market share through improved service products  faster transit times and expanded coverage 
consistent with these objectives  we announced full state coverage for the state of new hampshire in june  which increased the number of states that we provided coverage to while expansion plans are closely tied to the strength of the national economy  we seek to produce long term profitable growth by positioning ourselves to expand significantly in stronger economic times and avoiding the risk of overextending ourselves in weaker economic cycles 
revenue growth in was driven by an increase in the number of shipments handled coupled with a 
increase in revenue per shipment 
the improvement in revenue per shipment resulted from a increase in revenue per hundredweight  partially offset by a decrease in weight per shipment 
the improvement in revenue per hundredweight in was due more to a increase in our average length of haul than to our ability to raise rates or maintain pricing  particularly in the first half of the year 
our average length of haul increased to miles in from miles in a portion of our revenue growth in the second half of the year can be attributed to the increase in freight volume associated with the september  bankruptcy of consolidated freightways  a major national ltl carrier with annual revenues of billion in and one of our competitors 
while we experienced a increase in shipments and a 
decrease in revenue per shipment in the first half of the year  we gained a significant amount of momentum in the second half of the year as reflected by a increase in shipments and a improvement in revenue per shipment 
we also benefited from a full year of revenue and increased market share generated by the additional service centers we opened in our south central area on february   when we acquired certain assets of carter sons freightways of carrollton  texas 
as a result of our market share improvements throughout our service center network  tonnage increased in over  enabling us to obtain certain economies of scale as we moved greater concentrations of shipments through our existing route structure and service center network 
as a result  our incremental costs associated with this added volume were generally lower as reflected by the improvement in our operating ratio 
salaries  wages and employee benefit expenses  the largest component of our cost structure  were of revenue in compared to in most of these costs were incurred as variable driver and platform labor directly associated with the movement of shipments through our network 
our driver and platform wages  excluding benefit expenses  were of revenue in compared to for the cost of providing group health benefits to our employees and their families decreased to of revenue in from in after experiencing a increase in these costs in  primarily due to significant increases in the cost of our prescription drug benefit  we identified cost savings opportunities that were implemented in january these changes were instrumental in reducing the rate of increase in our group health costs in purchased transportation expenses  which includes lease operator costs  purchased linehaul  local transportation services and equipment rentals  decreased to of revenue in from in when there are capacity restraints within our fleet or when it is economically beneficial  we purchase transportation services for our linehaul and local pickup and delivery operations from lease operators  other motor carriers and rail providers 
in  lease operator expenses decreased from of revenue to  purchased linehaul services increased to 
of revenue from  and purchased pickup and delivery services decreased to from 
equipment rentals decreased from 
of revenue to 
from the prior year 
as we continue to expand our services and geographic coverage  we intend to decrease our use of purchased transportation and increase the utilization of our employees and equipment 
fuel costs  including fuel taxes  decreased to of revenue in from in our general tariffs and contracts generally include provisions for a fuel surcharge  recorded in net revenue  which have effectively offset significant diesel fuel price fluctuations 
these surcharges decrease or are eliminated as fuel prices approach certain floor levels 
the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  resulted in a decrease in amortization expenses of  in in addition  we also increased our asset utilization as more tonnage moved through our service center network 
as a result  depreciation and amortization expense dropped to of revenue in from for the prior year 
insurance and claims expense increased to of revenue in from in on april   we renewed many of our major insurance policies at significantly higher renewal rates  even after substantially increasing our self insured retention levels 
these higher rates resulted from overall increases in insurance markets  which affect the entire transportation industry  rather than our specific loss experience 
long term debt  including current maturities  decreased to  at december  compared to  at year end while debt levels were higher throughout the first months of  we used  of the net  in proceeds from our underwritten public offering of stock completed in november to repay all indebtedness under our revolving line of credit and retire a senior note 
although our debt levels were higher in  our weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was lower  resulting in a decrease in interest expense to of revenue from in we capitalized  in interest charges in compared to  in the effective tax rate for both and was 
liquidity and capital resources expansion in both the size and number of service center facilities  the planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and revenue growth have required continued investment in real estate and equipment 
in order to support these requirements  we incurred net capital expenditures of  during we funded these capital expenditures with  in cash generated from operating activities   in net additional borrowings   from stock issuances resulting from the exercise of stock options and  of our ending cash balance that remained from our november stock offering 
at december   long term debt including current maturities increased to  from  at december  we estimate net capital expenditures to be approximately  to  for the year ending december  of that  approximately  is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers   is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities  construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities   is allocated for investments in technology  and the balance is allocated for other assets 
we plan to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations supplemented by additional borrowings 
the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands land and structures tractors trailers technology other acquisition of business assets  net proceeds from sale total on may   we entered into an uncollateralized committed credit facility with wachovia bank  na formerly first union national bank  which  as amended  consisted of a  line of credit and a  line to support standby letters of credit 
this facility had a term of three years that expired on may   but was extended through july  interest on this line of credit was charged at rates that varied based upon a certain financial performance ratio 
the applicable interest rate for under this agreement was based upon libor plus 
to 
a fee ranging from 
to 
was charged on the unused portion of the line of credit  and fees ranging between 
and 
were charged on outstanding standby letters of credit 
we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement dated june  with lenders consisting of wachovia bank  na  bank of america  na  and branch banking and trust company  with wachovia as agent for the lenders 
this three year facility consists of  in line of credit commitments from the lenders  all of which are available for revolving loans 
in addition  of that  line of credit   may be used for letters of credit and  may be used for borrowings under wachovia s sweep program 
the sweep program is a daily cash management tool that automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of  or initiates overnight investments for excess cash balances 
revolving loans under the facility will bear interest at either a an applicable margin plus the higher of wachovia s prime rate or one half of one percentage point over the federal funds rate the adjusted base rate  or b libor plus an applicable margin the adjusted libor rate 
the applicable margin will vary depending upon our ratio of adjusted debt to capital 
in the case of the adjusted base rate  the applicable margin will range from to 
in the case of the adjusted libor rate  the applicable margin will range from 
to 
the applicable margin under this agreement for for the adjusted base rate and the adjusted libor rate was and  respectively 
revolving loans under the sweep program will bear interest at the aggregate rate applicable under the sweep program plus the adjusted libor rate 
quarterly fees ranging from 
to 
will be charged on the aggregate unused portion of the facility determined by our ratio of adjusted debt to capital 
the applicable rate for the periods under this agreement in was 
quarterly fees will be charged on the aggregate undrawn portion of outstanding letters of credit at a rate ranging from 
to  which was in as determined by our ratio of adjusted debt to capital 
in addition  a quarterly facing fee at an annual rate of 
was charged on the aggregate undrawn portion of outstanding letters of credit 
the new credit facility contains customary covenants  including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of adjusted debt to capital  to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth 
our wholly owned subsidiary guaranteed payment of all of our obligations under the facility 
future wholly owned subsidiaries would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility 
at december   there was  outstanding on the line of credit facility and there was  outstanding on the standby letter of credit facility 
we have three senior note agreements outstanding totaling  at december  these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities ranging from to  of which  is due in interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from to 
under the provisions of one of these notes  we may issue up to  of additional senior notes 
the applicable interest rate and payment schedules for any new notes will be determined and mutually agreed upon at the time of issuance 
our senior notes and credit agreement limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to shareholders pursuant to certain financial ratios 
at december   our debt instruments limited the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to  we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in  and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in with the exception of the line of credit  interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments 
therefore  short term exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility  which had an outstanding balance of  at december  we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
also  we do not use fuel hedging instruments  as our tariff provisions and contracts generally allow for fuel surcharges to be implemented in the event that fuel prices exceed stipulated levels 
a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability 
most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance  which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules 
we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance  and we believe the combination of our existing credit facilities along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet seasonal and long term capital needs 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than months months months over months long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total amounts committed amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands other commercial commitments less than months months months over months standby letters of credit contractual obligations include long term debt consisting primarily of senior notes totaling  capital lease obligations for trailers and computer equipment  and off balance sheet operating leases primarily consisting of real estate leases 
other commercial commitments consist of standby letters of credit used as collateral for self insured retention of insurance claims 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we apply the following critical accounting policies that affect judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses revenue and expense recognition operating revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion method based on average transit time 
expenses associated with operating revenue are recognized when incurred 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated ultimate total cost of claims  including amounts for claims incurred but not reported  for cargo loss and damage  bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation  long term disability and group health not covered by insurance 
these costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers compensation  long term disability and group health  which are charged to employee benefits expense 
we are currently self insured for bodily injury and property damage claims up to  per occurrence 
cargo loss and damage claims are self insured up to  we are self insured for workers compensation in certain states and have first dollar or high deductible plans in the remaining states with self insured retention levels ranging from  to  group health claims are self insured up to  per occurrence and long term disability claims are self insured to a maximum per individual of  per month 
insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors 
as a result  we periodically evaluate our self insured retention levels to determine the most cost efficient balance of self insurance and excess coverage 
in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses  we evaluate and monitor each claim individually  and we use factors such as historical experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability 
we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable  however  changes in the severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 
goodwill the excess cost over net assets acquired in connection with acquisitions  or goodwill  is recorded in other assets 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on january  and completed the required analyses of the fair value of our single reporting unit compared to the carrying value as of january   october  and october  based on those analyses  we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill on those measurement dates 
at december   goodwill totaled  prior to the adoption of sfas  these intangible assets were amortized using a straight line method over their estimated useful lives of to years 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives 
management uses historical experience  certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset 
periodically  we review property and equipment for impairment to include changes in operational and market conditions  and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 
currently  estimated economic lives for structures are to years  revenue equipment is to years  other equipment is to years  and leasehold improvements are the lesser of years or the life of the lease 
the use of different assumptions  estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value of our assets 
inflation most of our expenses are affected by inflation  which generally results in increased operating costs 
in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products  particularly diesel fuel  we have implemented a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements 
the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of fuel above a base price and increases as fuel prices escalate over the base 
for  the net effect of inflation on our results of operations was minimal

congdon is vice chairman of the board of leasing 
since  we have combined our requirements with leasing for the purchase of tractors  trailers  equipment  parts  tires and fuel 
we believe that  by combining our requirements  we are often able to obtain pricing discounts because of the increased level of purchasing 
while this is beneficial to us  our management believes that the termination of this relationship would not have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
for the years ended december   and  we charged leasing   and  respectively  for vehicle repair  maintenance and other services  which we provide to leasing at cost plus a negotiated markup 
in addition  we charged leasing  annually in  and  for rental of a vehicle maintenance facility located in chesapeake  virginia 
on march   we entered into an agreement to sublease a vehicle maintenance facility in south bend  indiana  to leasing for which we charged  in we purchased   and  of maintenance and other services from leasing in  and  respectively 
we believe that the prices we pay for such services are lower than would be charged by unaffiliated third parties for the same quality of work  and we intend to continue to purchase maintenance and other services from leasing  provided that leasing s prices continue to be favorable to us
