critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures by the company  including information about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the company believes  given current facts and circumstances  its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates  that management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below o revenue recognition o software development costs o valuation of inventory o income taxes o product warranty o impairment of investments revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
additionally  the company sells its products on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically shipping point 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales  which represents the majority of the company s revenue  occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which occurs upon shipment by the company 
revenue earned from arrangements for software systems requiring significant production  modification  or customization of software is recognized over the contract period as performance milestones are fulfilled 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  the company defers revenue recognition 
revenue from consulting and other services is recognized at the time the services are rendered 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses are determined 
revenue from software maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual period 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate because the company s terms of sale can vary  and management exercises judgment in determining whether to defer revenue recognition 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
software development costs all software development costs incurred in establishing the technological feasibility of computer software products to be sold are research and development costs 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility of a computer software product to be sold and prior to general release of that product are capitalized 
amounts capitalized are amortized commencing after general release of that product over the estimated remaining economic life of that product  generally three years  or using the ratio of current revenues to current and anticipated revenues from such product  whichever provides greater amortization 
if in the judgment of management  technological feasibility for a particular project has not been met or recoverability of amounts capitalized is in doubt  project costs are expensed as research and development or charged to costs of goods sold  as applicable 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to software development costs is a critical accounting estimate because the company s management exercises judgment in determining whether project costs are expensed as research and development or capitalized as an asset 
such judgments may materially affect expense amounts for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of gaap in determining when technological feasibility has been met and recoverability of software development costs is reasonably assured 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
the company s inventory includes purchased parts and components  work in process and finished goods 
the company provides inventory reserves for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are the company s purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles and the associated product support 
the company manages its exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing  to sales  to production  to after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of such assets and liabilities 
the company would record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because the company exercises judgment in estimating future taxable income  including prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  in assessing the need for any valuation allowance 
if the company should determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
product warranty the company has warranty obligations in connection with the sale of certain of its products 
the warranty period for these products is generally one year 
the costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale 
the company estimates its future warranty costs based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to product warranty is a critical accounting estimate because the company exercises judgment in determining future estimated warranty costs 
should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
impairment of investments during  the company held debt and equity investments in one company and in february  made a debt investment in another company 
on a periodic basis  the company reviews and evaluates its investments for potential impairment 
in determining whether impairment has occurred  the company considers such factors as the original expectations of the investment  performance of the investee company since the date of the investment  and current and future prospects for the investee company 
if events or changes in circumstances occur in which an other than temporary loss has occurred  the company will record an impairment of the investment by writing down the investment to the company s estimate of fair market value at the time of the impairment 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of investments is a critical accounting estimate because the company exercises judgment in determining whether an other than temporary loss has occurred and the company also estimates the fair market value of the investment at the time of the impairment 
strategy throughout  a new product strategy was executed that management believes will continue to drive the company s future growth 
this strategy repositioned the company to deliver fully managed  system level platform solutions to the embedded systems marketplace 
an important milestone in this strategy was achieved during with the release of the ipnexus advanced managed platform product line 
this new line of platform solutions specifically addresses equipment manufacturers requirements for an increased level of system integration and services from suppliers 
the company s new platform products enable equipment manufacturers downsized engineering staffs to improve time to market for their new products 
the company s strategy addresses this trend by enabling customers to replace proprietary or legacy platforms with the latest generation of fully managed platform functionality 
please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further information regarding the company s strategy 
key performance indicator the company s integrated platform and component products are incorporated into current and next generation embedded systems infrastructure 
traditionally  design wins have been an important metric for management to judge the company s product acceptance in its marketplace 
design wins  if implemented  reach production volumes at varying rates  generally beginning to months after the design win occurs 
a variety of risks such as schedule delays  cancellations  changes in customer markets and economic conditions can adversely affect a design win before production is reached  or during deployment 
during  the company was notified of design wins by its customers 
these new design wins were for its integrated platform solutions with multiple products  individual component design wins for ipnexus switching  ipnexus access  computing products and segway signaling products 
during  the company was informed of new design wins 
these design wins were for its integrated platform solutions with multiple products  individual component design wins for its ipnexus switching  ipnexus access  and segway signaling products 
not all design wins are expected to result in production orders 
the company believes that the decrease in design wins from to was a result of fewer firms doing new design activity 
industry overview as the sluggish economy continued into  the company s customers who are embedded system suppliers  continued to maintain tight cost controls  limit engineering resources and realign their business models 
these fiscal controls appear to have created a more concentrated supplier landscape for that is trimmer  but more highly focused on market opportunities 
in addition  when these organizations resized their engineering and product development resources  they also made similar staffing changes in purchasing  logistics and supply groups 
due to these circumstances  many customers are now anxious to limit their number of suppliers and form strategic relationships with organizations that have broader capabilities 
management believes that the added capability resulting from the acquisition in and integration of the intel communications platform group has positioned the company to service these evolving market needs and opportunities 
furthermore  this acquisition more than doubled the company s total available market through the addition of key computing and platform products 
the company s capability and market served was further expanded in early by the acquisition of mapletree networks  inc and its products that address voice processing applications 
these additions to the company s traditional product offerings have enabled the company to become a strategic partner for higher level  integrated platform solutions for our customers
