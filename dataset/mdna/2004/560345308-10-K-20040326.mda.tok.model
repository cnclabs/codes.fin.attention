item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary background we commenced our restaurant operations in may with the acquisition of four tgi friday s restaurants in arizona and nevada 
during the past years  we have grown through acquisitions and development of new restaurants 
we currently own restaurants 
in  operations were impacted by soft economic conditions  especially in the fourth quarter and subsequent to the september th attacks on the united states 
these conditions halted our positive same store sales increase record at consecutive quarters and predicated the fourth quarter impairment write down of five owned restaurants and the management agreement receivable impairment write down for six stores we managed in northern california and el paso  texas 
we opened seven new restaurants in  including three tgi friday s  one redfish  and three bamboo club locations 
the tgi friday s restaurants are located in west albuquerque  new mexico  roseville  california sacramento area  and porter ranch  california los angeles area 
the redfish restaurant is located in north scottsdale  arizona  and the bamboo club restaurants are located in tampa  florida  wellington  florida west palm beach area  and tempe  arizona phoenix area 
we opened six new restaurants in  including one tgi friday s and one redfish in chandler  arizona  three bamboo clubs in tucson  arizona  newport  kentucky  and king of prussia  pennsylvania  and one alice cooper stown in cleveland  ohio in the location formally occupied by an underperforming redfish restaurant that we closed 
in addition  we closed an underperforming redfish restaurant in san diego  california and subleased the premises to a local san diego nightclub operator 
we also closed underperforming tgi friday s restaurants in kansas city  missouri and in el paso  texas 
during  we recorded charges for i the write down of land held for sale of  and ii impairment charges and other of  including asset impairment for an under performing restaurant location that was closed  an allocation of  of goodwill  and  in lease cancellation charges related to this closure 
we opened five new restaurants in  including one tgi friday s in the desert ridge mall  in arizona and four bamboo club asian bistro restaurants in novi detroit  michigan  aventura mall north miami  florida  desert ridge mall  arizona  and raleigh durham  north carolina 
we sold three tgi friday s restaurants in northern california  and we entered into an agreement canceling the management of four tgi friday s in california that we managed 
we closed an underperforming redfish seafood grill and bar in denver  colorado and sub leased the location to a third party 
during  we recorded charges for i a write down in the value of land we hold for sale of  ii impairment charges and other of  including asset impairments for underperforming restaurant locations  one of which was closed during  iii an allocation of  of goodwill and franchise area goodwill for a restaurant we closed in and a restaurant that will close in early  iv  in lease cancellation charges related to a restaurant that will close in early  v a provision of  for the termination of a management agreement of four restaurants we managed in northern california  vi a  provision for the retirement on march  of our ceo  and vii a write off of  for deferred financing fees associated with an early debt refinancing 
economic overview we conduct business in the casual dining restaurant industry and the operating performance of our restaurants is directly and heavily influenced by the overall state of the national and local economies where our restaurants are located 
when overall economic conditions negatively impact the financial performance of an individual restaurant  we periodically consider all of the factors influencing that restaurant  such as operational efficiencies  local demographic changes  local construction activity  competition  and other related factors 
we then assess the prospect that we can improve both the short term and long term financial results  at least to a level sufficient to recover our investment in the leasehold improvements and equipment assets 
there have been and likely will continue to be situations where we will make the decision that an asset is impaired and a write down is required 
asset impairments and write offs the vast majority of our tgi friday s restaurants have performed well  thus  we have experienced a limited number of asset impairments in recent years 
as the local and national economies strengthen and our financial performance improves or remains strong  the overall judgment call about asset impairment write downs  for all of our brands  becomes easier  when the economy weakens  this judgment is made more difficult 
in the last months in our bamboo club brand  we have opened ten new restaurants 
financial results have been slightly below our original expectations  primarily as a result of the timing of when we opened these restaurants and the state of the weak national economy 
however  two of these new locations newport and aventura have performed significantly below our expectations  due in part to what we now believe to be poor real estate location decisions 
in one case  the demographics of the mall are not consistent with our target demographics 
in the other case  our physical location within the mall provides poor visibility and customer access 
although both of these locations remain open and operating  we recorded asset impairments in on both of these locations 
we cannot rule out future losses at these or any other locations 
in the future and for many business reasons  we may vacate an operating property where we have a long term lease obligation 
any such vacation of property may require us to pay fees and costs  which are likely to be material 
employee related insurance costs and wage expense another major cost category for us is employee related insurance costs  such as health care and workers compensation benefits 
we self insure for the majority of the risks associated with these costs and we purchase excess liability insurance for situations where the individual cases become very costly 
each mid year and again at year end  with the assistance of our insurance actuaries  we evaluate the actual claims history to i predict the estimated total costs to accrue for the upcoming year  and ii to evaluate the level of accruals for prior years open claims 
as claims mature  we are provided with better information and insight about the likely ultimate outcomes and can better estimate the ultimate liability for any given year 
however  this judgment can impact the amount of accruals actually needed as compared to previous amounts recorded  and any shortfall or excess can be material 
in addition  of our restaurants  are located in california 
california does not permit us to reduce the minimum wage that we are required to pay to our wait staff by the amount of tips and gratuity they receive from our customers 
this practice is permitted in most other states in which we operate 
this condition results in a significantly higher level of wages paid to our employees in california  compared to the other ten states in which we operate 
this condition also impacts worker compensation benefits and our costs in california 
we estimate that our workers compensation cost for each claim in california is more than double the cost we experience in other states 
finally  the california legislature has recently enacted legislation that  if it remains in effect  will require us to pay of the health care costs  starting in  for all of our california based employees and their families 
we estimate this annual cost may be as much as million based on current employment levels 
we can not predict whether  or to what extent  we will be able to absorb these additional costs through price increases  operational efficiencies  staff reductions  or cost controls 
long term debt we are a highly leveraged company 
our long term debt of approximately million at december  is held by five principal lenders 
we expect to pay interest on this debt of million in however  after consideration of the impact of our swap agreements  approximately of our loans are tied to variable interest 
we currently benefit from the historically low levels of interest rates 
if interest rates rise in  our annualized interest expense will increase by approximately  for each one percentage point increase in short term interest rates as measured by libor 
in addition  we have interest rate swaps whose value or obligation changes with the change in long term interest rates 
since it is our intention to hold these swaps until maturity  the impact of the increase in value or the liability is reflected primarily on our balance sheet 
should we decide for appropriate business reasons to liquidate the debt and or the related swaps early  this increased value or obligation depending on when liquidated would be triggered as an item recorded in our income statement  and this amount could be material 
sale of assets finally  we consider selling operating or other assets from time to time  and we have an active program of reviewing our options and opportunities on a regular basis 
we may enter into a transaction to sell non strategic assets  or as part of a program to raise cash 
we may sell these assets at either a gain or loss and this gain or loss could be material 
outlook a number of factors serve as the basis of cautious optimism for i we have seen positive signs about the national economy in early  ii the tgi friday s partnership with atkins to deliver low carb menu items looks very promising  and iii we plan to open only one restaurant for all of we expect our ebitda to be approximately million to million in see table below 
this level of cash flow should allow us to meet all of our obligations as they come due and to provide sufficient cash flow to pay our debt obligations of principal and interest  to comply with our debt covenants  to build two restaurants  and to provide our stores with routine capital equipment needs 
ebitda reconciliation twelve months ended december  in millions net income add income taxes interest expense depreciation and amor tization ebitda critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  in that they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to our operations 
these critical accounting policies relate to the valuation  impairment and amortizable lives of long lived assets  goodwill  and to other identifiable intangible assets  valuation of deferred tax assets  reserves related to self insurance for workers compensation and general liability  and recognition of stock based employee compensation 
these policies are as follows we periodically perform asset impairment analysis of long lived assets related to our restaurant locations  goodwill  and other identifiable intangible assets 
we perform these tests whenever we experience a triggering event  such as a decision to close a location or major change in the locations operating environment  or other event that might impact our ability to recover our asset investment 
also  we have a policy of reviewing the financial operations of our restaurant locations on at least a quarterly basis 
locations that are not meeting expectations are identified and continue to be watched closely throughout the year 
primarily in the fourth quarter  actual results are reviewed and budgets for the ensuing year are analyzed 
if we deem that a location s results will continue to be below expectations  alternatives for its continued operation are considered 
at this time  we perform an asset impairment test 
if it is determined that the asset s fair value is less than book value and we will be unable to recover our investment through operations  an impairment charge is recorded 
upon an event  such as a formal decision for abandonment restaurant closure  we may record additional impairment of assets and an allocation of goodwill if the location was one that was acquired 
any carryover basis of assets is depreciated over the respective remaining useful lives 
periodically we adjust the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to carry the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized  based upon recent past financial performance  tax reporting positions  and expectations of future taxable income 
we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on any future tax benefits until we achieve profitable operations 
we use an actuarial based methodology utilizing our historical experience factors to periodically adjust self insurance reserves for workers compensation and general liability claims and settlements 
these estimates are adjusted based upon annual information received in july of each year in connection with policy renewals 
estimated costs for the following year are accrued on a monthly basis and progress against this estimate is re evaluated based upon actual claim data received each quarter 
we use the method of accounting for employee stock options allowed under apb opinion and have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 which require pro forma disclosure of the impact of using the fair value at date of grant method of recording stock based employee compensation 
we believe estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances  however  should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences  there could be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages that certain items of income and expense bear to total revenue fiscal year ended december  december  december  revenue restaurant operating expenses cost of sales payroll and benefits depreciation and amortization other operating expenses total restaurant operating expenses income from restaurant operations amortization of intangibles general and administrative expenses preopening expenses new manager training expenses impairment charges and other management fee income operating income loss gain from sale of assets interest expense and other  net income loss before income taxes fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for the fiscal year ended december  increased by million  or  to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  of this increase  million was primarily a result of opening five new restaurants in and the full year of revenues for the six restaurants opened in this increase was offset by revenues lost of approximately million as a result of the sale of three tgi friday s and the closure of one redfish restaurant 
same store sales increased  or million  for fiscal compared to an increase in same store sales of for same stores sales percentages represent sales for stores that have been open for at least months 
revenue from alcoholic beverages accounted for of revenue in and in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in this decrease was due primarily to lower contractual prices on certain items such as meat and seafood  stronger supply chain buying efforts  and slight menu pricing increases 
the decrease was also attributable to promotional driven product mix changes 
payroll and benefits consist of restaurant management salaries  hourly payroll expenses and other payroll related benefits  including bonus and health care 
payroll and benefit costs increased slightly as a percentage of revenue to in from in as a result of new bonus programs and improved restaurant performance  we experienced increases in bonus expense during compared to these increases were partially offset by lower labor costs related to labor efficiencies resulting from the maturation of bamboo club restaurants labor costs of new restaurants are higher during the initial four to six months of operation and productivity gains at our tgi friday s restaurants 
depreciation and amortization before income from restaurant operations includes depreciation of restaurant property and equipment and amortization of franchise fees and liquor licenses 
depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in this increase was primarily a result of depreciation related to asset acquisitions for new stores and accelerated depreciation of the assets of a california location that we sold during the third quarter the increase was partially offset by the reduction in depreciation as a result of asset impairments recorded during and other operating expenses include rent  real estate taxes  common area maintenance charges  advertising  workers compensation and property insurance  maintenance  and utilities 
other operating expenses increased by million and as a percentage of revenue to in from in the increase was principally due to i higher marketing fees of million paid to tgi friday s for the national friday s advertising campaign  which consisted of five week flights in versus four week flights in  ii increased occupancy expenses of million related to higher cam charges  property taxes and relatively higher lease costs for our bamboo club locations  iii higher utility costs of  and iv higher worker s compensation and general liability costs  primarily in california  which increased million over the prior year 
depreciation and amortization after income from restaurant operations includes depreciation of corporate property and equipment  amortization of identifiable intangibles  and amortization of goodwill as applicable 
depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the increase was primarily a result of additional depreciation related to new point of sale software we purchased in the third quarter of and the amortization of franchise area goodwill 
general and administrative expenses are those expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support new restaurant development and restaurant operations and provide administrative  accounting and management infrastructure 
these costs consist primarily of management and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  legal and professional fees  and technology support 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to  or of revenue  in from  or of revenue  in we experienced increases related to higher local marketing costs  investor relations consulting fees  and legal expenses 
the increases were offset by lower salaries and benefits from a reduction in the number of employees  reduced travel as a result of the slow down in new store openings during  and decreases resulting from a focused cost reduction effort implemented in the fourth quarter of pre opening expenses are costs incurred prior to opening a new restaurant and consist primarily of manager salaries and relocation and training costs 
historically  we have experienced variability in the amount and percentage of revenues attributable to pre opening expenses 
we typically incur the most significant portion of pre opening expenses associated with a given restaurant in the two months immediately preceding opening and in the month of opening 
pre opening expenses were  or of revenue  in as compared to  or of revenue  in these decreases were the result fewer new store openings in five compared to six and the timing of incurring the expenses related to these openings 
new manager training expenses are those costs incurred in training newly hired or promoted managers  as well as those costs incurred to relocate those managers to permanent management positions 
new manager training expenses were  or of revenue  for the year ended december  compared to  or of revenue  in this decrease was primarily a result of fewer new store openings in compared to and expenses incurred in related to new stores opened in early in  the impairment charges and other account included the write off or write down of asset impairments of certain leasehold improvements  equipment and other operating assets 
the account included i  primarily to reduce the carrying value of these assets on underperforming locations to their estimated fair value  ii  of goodwill and franchise area goodwill allocated to a closed redfish location in denver  colorado  and two impaired locations  one of which will close in early  iii  in lease cancellation charges and other costs associated with the closing of a tgi friday s in salinas  california in early  iv a reduction of  in the value of the land and building we hold for sale in el paso  texas  v a provision of  for the termination of a management agreement under which we managed four restaurants in northern california  vi a provision of  for the retirement on march  for our ceo  and vii a write off of  for deferred financing fees associated with early refinancing of debt 
interest expense and other  net was approximately million  or of revenue  in compared with million  or of revenue  in this increase was primarily attributable to slightly higher average outstanding borrowings  higher credit spreads due to increased leverage  and a prepayment penalty of  associated with early refinancing of debt 
this increase was offset some by more favorable interest rates on our variable interest rate debt 
during the years ended december  and december   we had average outstanding borrowings of  and  respectively  with effective interest rates of and  respectively 
at december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits available to offset future book income and federal income taxes 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for the fiscal year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of opening six new restaurants in and the full year of revenues for the seven restaurants opened in same store sales increased for fiscal compared to an increase in same store sales of for same stores sales percentages represent sales for stores that have been open for at least months 
revenue from alcoholic beverages accounted for of revenue in and in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to in from in this decrease was due primarily to lower prices on certain food supplies  partially offset by higher costs for produce  seafood  and grocery products 
payroll and benefit costs increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in this increase was primarily due to a per hour minimum wage increase in our california market  effective january   and increases in management labor and benefits resulting from lower turnover 
as discussed below  new manager labor expense is charged to the new manager training expense account 
therefore  when turnover is lower  less labor is charged to the new manager training expense account and more labor remains in the payroll and benefits account 
payroll and benefits increases were also the result of higher health insurance costs 
depreciation and amortization before income from restaurant operations includes depreciation of restaurant property and equipment and amortization of franchise fees and liquor licenses 
depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in  primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense due to the impairment of assets for several underperforming locations recorded in december  and additional asset impairments recorded in the third quarter of other operating expenses include rent  real estate taxes  common area maintenance charges  advertising  insurance  maintenance  and utilities 
other operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the increase was due primarily to additional unit level advertising costs  store rent increases related to new store openings  and marketing fee increases 
the franchise agreements between tgi friday s inc and our company require a of net sales royalty and up to a of net sales marketing contribution 
each year we contribute to a tgi friday s national marketing pool 
in  the pool contribution was of net sales for the first three fiscal quarters and of net sales for the fourth quarter 
the pool contribution percentage decreased because tgi friday s inc cancelled its tgi friday s national advertising campaign for the entire fourth quarter of in  the contribution to the fund was of sales  resulting in an increase over the prior year 
this contribution offsets a portion of our general marketing requirement 
depreciation and amortization after income from restaurant operations includes depreciation of corporate property and equipment  amortization of identifiable intangibles  and amortization of goodwill as applicable 
depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in  as a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization under sfas no 
 effective as of january  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to  or of revenue  in from  or of revenue in the increase was due primarily to increases in salaries  benefits  and travel related to building of the bamboo club infrastructure and increases in technology support costs  higher legal costs  and higher rent due to additional office space 
pre opening expenses were  or of revenue  in as compared to  or of revenue in although we opened six stores in compared to seven stores in  our expenses were higher in due primarily to incurring costs in for new store openings in  combined with increases in employee recruiting and training  new store opening team travel  and promotional events 
the majority of pre opening expenses occur during the two months prior to opening a store 
new manager training expenses are those costs incurred in training newly hired or promoted managers  as well as those costs incurred to relocate those managers to permanent management positions 
new manager training expenses were  or of revenue  in compared to  or of revenue  in although new manager training expenses were consistent as a percentage of revenue  the increases in were primarily the result of new store openings in compared to and expenses incurred in related to new stores opened in early in  the impairment charges and other account included the impairment of certain leasehold improvements and other operating assets 
the account included i  to primarily reduce the carrying value of these assets on underperforming locations to their estimated fair value  ii  of goodwill allocated to a closed location in kansas city  missouri  and two impaired california locations where we decided not to renew the lease when the initial terms expire in  iii  in lease cancellation charges and  in asset write downs for three bamboo club locations that we elected not to open  and iv lease cancellation costs of  for our leawood  kansas location where we decided to cancel a lease early leawood  ks 
during the third quarter of  we also reduced the value of the land and building we are holding for sale in el paso  texas by  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment expense of  against a management agreement with cnl 
under management agreements  we managed four tgi friday s stores in northern california and managed one tgi friday s store in el paso  texas 
during the fourth quarter  the el paso  texas location was closed 
under these agreements  we were entitled to a management fee if certain cash flow levels were achieved 
based on the cash flow provisions of the management agreements  we were unable to record management fee income during compared to  or of revenue  in interest expense and other  net was approximately  or of revenue  in compared to  or of revenue  in although we incurred additional debt and a corresponding increase in interest expense in  the increased expenses compared with were offset by more favorable interest rate conditions on our variable interest rate debt 
as of december   approximately of our total debt was tied to variable interest rates 
during the years ended december  and december  we had average outstanding borrowings of  and  respectively  with effective interest rates of and  respectively 
as a result of a substantial net loss during  we provided an additional valuation allowance to fully reserve all of our net deferred tax asset 
an income tax benefit of  was recorded in because we offset net operating loss carryforwards against taxable income 
we were in a taxable income situation in due to the recognition of various timing differences from at december   we had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards available to offset future income for federal income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources our primary use of funds over the past five years has been for the acquisition of existing tgi friday s restaurants  the development of new tgi friday s restaurants  and the acquisition and development of the redfish and bamboo club restaurants and concepts 
these acquisitions were financed principally through a new stock rights offering to existing stockholders  the issuance of long term debt  and internally generated cash 
at december   we had long term debt with five banks and financial institutions  including current portion of million  requiring principal and interest payments of approximately million in all of our loan agreements contain various financial covenants that are generally measured at the end of each quarter 
primarily  there are two key covenants we must meet 
several loan agreements incorporate a fixed charge coverage test  which requires us to produce a level of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization and other unusual gains or losses ebitda in excess of principal and interest under our debt obligations during rolling twelve month periods 
other loan agreements modify this covenant for items such as pre opening costs and rent expense 
many of our loan documents also limit the amount of long term debt the company can borrow based on trailing levels of ebitda 
at december   we met all of the financial covenants for all debt agreements  as amended 
our operations in have been positively impacted by a slow economic recovery  resulting in a same store sales increase 
if the positive economic trend does not continue and our cash flow does not improve from recent levels  we may violate one or more of these covenants with any one of our lenders in currently  we have no significant borrowing capabilities under any of our debt agreements 
some of our financial covenants depend upon profitable operations and limit the total amount of debt we can have outstanding during  we entered into a million  one year revolving line of credit with a bank 
at december    was outstanding on this line 
we believe we will remain in compliance with our current debt agreements  as amended  in or will receive the necessary amendments  if needed  to our debt covenants 
we believe that our current cash resources  additional debt financing commitments  sale of assets  and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our general obligations and planned limited development through as previously discussed  we currently have one bamboo club under construction and the commitment to commence building one other in we plan on starting construction of one tgi friday s during late  for opening in we believe we may need to obtain capital to fund additional growth beyond potential sources of any such capital include selling assets  bank financing  strategic alliances  and additional offerings of our equity or debt securities 
we cannot provide assurance that such capital will be available from these or other potential sources  and the lack of capital could have a material adverse effect on our business 
net cash flows from operating activities were  in   in  and  in cash flows from operating activities were offset by  for funds used to make regular debt payments during  and supplemented by cash flows from financing of  in and  in  which we used to fund our acquisitions and development of new restaurants 
net cash used in investing activities was  in   in  and  in  which we used primarily to fund property and equipment purchases for our new restaurants and to acquire franchise rights and goodwill related to both the purchase and opening of new restaurants 
funds used in investing activities were offset by cash received from the sale of assets of three restaurants in the sacramento california area in and cash received from the sale of assets related to our sale leaseback transactions during at december   our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately  due in part to cash expended on our development requirements and because the restaurant business receives substantially immediate payment for sales  while payables related to inventories and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms  usually to days 
at december   we had a cash balance of  and long term debt of  including current portion of long term debt of  monthly cash receipts have been and are expected to be sufficient to pay all obligations as they become due 
approximately  of this debt is term loans comprised of notes payable to three lenders 
the notes bear interest at rates ranging from per annum and mature at various times over the next years 
the remainder of our long term debt consists of notes payable to various lending institutions 
these notes bear interest at rates ranging from to and mature at various times over the next years 
from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swap agreements with certain financial institutions for the purpose of adjusting our ratio of fixed rate debt over a certain period of time at varying notional amounts 
at december   there were million in net notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements outstanding that carried a weighted average interest rate of 
the effective amount of interest we pay on the notional amounts of these swap agreements is calculated using the interest rate of the swap against the notional amount of each swap 
these swaps effectively adjust the ratio of fixed rate debt to of total outstanding debt 
we lease all of our restaurants with terms ranging from to years  with various renewal options of years 
our future debt  lease  and purchase obligations are summarized by year as follows in thousands contractual obligations and commitments total less than one year one to three years three to five years greater than five years debt maturities minimum lease commitments purchase commitments total minimum lease commitments represent operating leases on our restaurant locations 
we have no other off balance sheet financings 
a default under a lease agreement could result in damages or the acceleration of amounts due under the lease 
total purchase commitments include construction costs for a restaurant we have contracted to open in we believe that our current resources and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our capital needs and debt maturities during the next months 
prolonged future adverse geopolitical and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial capabilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we were participating in three derivative financial instruments for which fair value disclosure is required under sfas no 
the fair value liability of the interest rate swap agreements discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements increased to  using hedge accounting under sfas no 
our market risk exposure is limited to interest rate risk associated with our credit instruments 
we incur interest on loans made at variable interest rates of to over libor 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings on these loans of approximately  our net interest expense for was  a one percent variation on any of the variable rates would have increased or decreased our total interest expense by approximately  for the year  not including the impact of our swaps
