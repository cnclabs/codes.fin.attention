item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading education company serving the prek education market by providing products  services and ideas that enhance student achievement and development to educators and schools across the united states and canada 
we offer more than  items through an innovative two pronged marketing approach that targets both school administrators and individual teachers 
we have grown significantly in recent years through acquisitions and internal growth 
for information on our recent acquisitions see the business combinations note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our revenues for fiscal were million and our operating income was million  which represented compound annual revenue growth of and compound annual operating income growth of  compared to our fiscal results 
our gross margin has improved from in fiscal to in fiscal this improvement was due to an increase in our offering of proprietary products and increased buying power 
we have acquired many specialty businesses  which tend to have more proprietary products in their offerings and consequently higher gross margins than our traditional businesses 
the specialty businesses have also experienced higher revenue growth than the traditional business  resulting in an improved  higher gross margin  product mix 
in addition  our acquisitions of both specialty and traditional businesses have increased our purchasing power  resulting in reduced costs of the products we purchase 
our operating profit and margins have also improved significantly since fiscal this improvement reflects our acquisitions of specialty businesses  which typically have higher operating margins than our traditional business 
in addition  through the integration of acquired businesses  we have been able to further improve our operating profit and margins by eliminating redundant expenses  leveraging overhead costs and improving purchasing power 
as a result of integrating acquired operations  we recorded a restructuring charge in fiscal the charge was incurred primarily to close existing facilities and to consolidate operations that  when combined with acquired operations  became redundant 
to the extent our integrations have resulted in certain exit costs such as the closure of acquired facilities  the costs were accrued in purchase accounting 
our business and working capital needs are highly seasonal with peak sales levels occurring from june through october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of our business so that schools and teachers receive their merchandise by the start of each school year 
our inventory levels increase in april through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
the majority of shipments are made between june and october and the majority of cash receipts are collected from september through december 
as a result  we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first two quarters of our fiscal year and operate at a net loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
our business is highly seasonal  and the acquisitions of seasonal businesses during the off season has depressed operating margins and income in the year of acquisition  the most dramatic of which were the jl hammett acquisition in fiscal and premier agendas in fiscal

liquidity and capital resources at april   we had working capital of million 
our capitalization at april  was million  consisting of total debt of million and shareholders equity of million 
on april  we amended and extended our revolving credit facility with bank of america  na  acting as agent 
the new credit agreement matures on april  and provides for million of availability 
the amount outstanding as of april  under the credit facility was million 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains certain financial and other covenants 
during fiscal  we borrowed under our credit facility primarily for seasonal working 
table of contents capital and acquisitions 
our borrowings are usually significantly higher during the first two quarters of our fiscal year to meet the working capital needs of our peak selling season 
as of april   our effective interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility was approximately  which excludes amortization of loan origination fee costs and the commitment fees on unborrowed funds 
during fiscal  we paid commitment fees on unborrowed funds under the credit facility in the range of basis points to basis points and amortized loan origination fee costs of million related to the credit facility during fiscal on july   we sold an aggregate principal amount of million of convertible subordinated notes due august  on july   the initial purchasers of the notes exercised their option to purchase an additional million of these notes 
the notes carry an annual interest rate of which  depending on the market price of the notes  could be subject to an upward adjustment commencing august  the notes  which provide for a contingent conversion feature  are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share if the closing price of the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market exceeds for a specified amount of time and under certain other circumstances

under the agreements  we recorded million of debt  which has an effective interest rate of  excluding amortization of related fees 
the leases expire in november the amount outstanding as of april  under the agreements was million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in cash from operating activities was primarily due to a million increase in amounts advanced under the accounts receivable securitization facility described below and a reduction in accounts receivable outstanding due to faster collection 
these contributions to cash provided by operations were partially offset by an increase in inventories 
the increase in our inventories was caused by the earlier purchasing cycle of califone and children s publishing relative to most of our other businesses  a planned increase in importing and the purchase of larger quantities in advance of the season for key products to avoid stock outs during the season

net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was million 

table of contents net repayments on bank borrowings and capital leases of million and payment of related debt fees of million  primarily relating to the new credit facility  were offset by million of proceeds from stock option exercises 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations  borrowings available from our existing credit facility and other sources of capital will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for operations  including anticipated capital expenditures and our contractual obligations 
we expect our fiscal capital expenditures to be approximately to million and to consist primarily of computer hardware and software costs related to continued implementation of our new business systems and warehouse equipment costs for a new facility under construction in pennsylvania 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently have a million accounts receivable securitization facility which expires in november we entered into the facility for the purpose of reducing our variable rate interest expense 
the facility was amended during november to extend the expiration date to november and may be extended further with the financial institution s consent 
at april   million was advanced under the accounts receivable securitization and accordingly  that amount of accounts receivable has been removed from our consolidated balance sheet

as of april   we did not have any material long term purchase obligations 
any short term purchase obligations the company had as of april  were primarily for the purchase of inventory in the normal course 

table of contents fluctuations in quarterly results of operations our business is subject to seasonal influences 
our historical revenues and profitability have been dramatically higher in the first two quarters of our fiscal year  primarily due to increased shipments to customers coinciding with the start of each school year 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in our costs for the products sold  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies we acquire may differ substantially from our own  which could contribute to further fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for fiscal years and we derived this quarterly data from our unaudited consolidated financial statements 
fiscal first second third fourth total revenues gross profit operating income loss net income loss per share amounts basic diluted fiscal first second third fourth total revenues gross profit operating income loss net income loss per share amounts basic diluted inflation inflation has had and is expected to have only a minor effect on our results of operations and our internal and external sources of liquidity 
critical accounting policies we believe the policies identified below are critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business are discussed throughout md a where applicable 
refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item for detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent 
table of contents assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and base them on a combination of historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition revenue  net of estimated returns and allowances  is recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to customers  which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers  the selling price is fixed  the customer is obligated to pay and we have no significant remaining obligations 
cash received in advance from customers is deferred on our balance sheet as a current liability and recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to the customers 
catalog costs and related amortization we spend over million annually to produce and distribute catalogs 
we accumulate all direct costs incurred  net of vendor cooperative advertising payments  in the development  production and circulation of our catalogs on our balance sheet until such time as the related catalog is mailed 
they are subsequently amortized into sg a over the expected sales realization cycle  which is one year or less 
consequently  any difference between our estimated and actual revenue stream for a particular catalog and the related impact on amortization expense is neutralized within a period of one year or less 
our estimate of the expected sales realization cycle for a particular catalog is based on  among other possible considerations  our historical sales experience with identical or similar catalogs and our assessment of prevailing economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we track our subsequent sales realization  reassess the marketplace  and compare our findings to our previous estimate and adjust the amortization of our future catalogs  if necessary 
development costs we accumulate external and certain internal costs incurred in the development of a master copy of a book  video or other media on our balance sheet 
as of april   we had million in net development costs on our balance sheet 
a majority of these costs are associated with our children s publishing business 
the capitalized development costs are subsequently amortized into cost of revenues over the expected sales realization cycle of the products  which is typically five years 
during fiscal  we amortized to expense million related to development costs 
if the annual prepublication amortization varied by one percentage point  the consolidated amortization expense for fiscal would have changed by less than million 
we continue to monitor the expected sales realization cycle for each product  and will adjust the remaining expected life of the development costs or recognize an impairment  if warranted 
goodwill and intangible assets at april   goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
determining the recoverability of these assets requires considerable judgment and is evaluated on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
as it relates to goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules in accordance with sfas no 
as required by sfas no 
 the recoverability of these assets is subject to a fair value assessment which includes several significant judgments regarding financial projections and comparable market values 
as it relates to finite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules as 
table of contents required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which also requires significant judgment and assumptions related to the expected future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset 
the impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate of fair value and  thus  the estimated recoverability  or impairment  if any  of the asset 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and debt 
market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
our borrowings under our credit facility and our discount expense related to our accounts receivable securitization are primarily dependent upon libor rates 
assuming no change in our financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average basis points higher during fiscal  pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million 
this amount was determined by considering a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates on average variable rate debt outstanding and the average advanced under the receivable securitization during fiscal the estimated fair value of long term debt approximated its carrying value at april   with the exception of our convertible debt which at april  had a carrying value of million and a fair market value of million 
to manage interest rate risk on the variable rate borrowings under our credit facility  we have historically entered into interest rate swap agreements 
these interest rate swap agreements had the effect of locking in  for a specified period  the base interest rate we paid on a notional principal amount established in the swaps 
as a result  while these hedging arrangements were structured to reduce our exposure to interest rate increases  it also limits the benefit we might otherwise have received from any interest rate decreases 
the swaps were typically cash settled monthly  with interest expense adjusted for amounts paid or received 
the swap agreements had the effect of increasing interest expense by approximately million in fiscal no swap agreements were in place during fiscal or we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
