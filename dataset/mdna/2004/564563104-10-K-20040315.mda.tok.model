item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discontinued operations and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements reflect  under the heading discontinued operations  the company s estimate of the net losses it expected from these operations through the date it estimated they would be disposed  and all losses expected to be realized upon the disposal of these operations 
subsequent to the disposal of these businesses  the company may continue to be exposed to some liabilities arising from their prior operations 
for example  the company recently settled a lawsuit alleging that it caused or contributed to soil and groundwater contamination 
for more information on this lawsuit  see item legal proceedings 
the operations from this subsidiary  the company s former environmental consulting and remediation business  may not have been conducted in compliance with environmental laws  exposing the company to further liability and damages for the costs of investigating and cleaning up sites of spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous materials 
the company cannot assure you that its liability in these matters  or any other environmental liabilities that arise in the future  will not exceed its resources or will be covered by insurance 
even though the company has disposed of this and the other four discontinued operations  it likely will remain liable for any costs  damages or other liabilities imposed upon them that result from or relate to their operations prior to the disposition 
the company may be affected by intellectual property infringement claims 
the company s business operations rely extensively on procuring and deploying intellectual property 
the company s employees develop some of the software solutions and other forms of intellectual property that the company uses to provide information technology solutions to its customers  but it also licenses technology from primary vendors 
typically  under federal government contracts  the company s government customers may claim rights in the intellectual property the company develops  making it impossible for the company to prevent their future use of the company s intellectual property 
the company is and may in the future be subject to claims from its employees or third parties who assert that software solutions and other forms of intellectual property that the company used in delivering services and solutions to the company s customers infringe upon intellectual property rights of such employees or third parties 
if the company s vendors  the company s employees or third parties assert claims that the company or the company s customers are infringing on their intellectual property  the company could incur substantial costs to defend these claims 
in addition  if any of these infringement claims are ultimately successful  the company could be required to cease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged software or technology  obtain a license or additional licenses  or redesign the company s products and services that rely on the challenged software or technology 
covenants in the company s credit facility may restrict the company s financial and operating flexibility 
the company s credit facility contains covenants that limit or restrict  among other things the company s ability to borrow money outside of the amounts committed under the credit facility  make investments in certain of its subsidiaries or in other entities not listed as borrowers under the credit facility  make other restricted payments  pay dividends on the company s common stock  sell or otherwise dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business  merge or consolidate  or make acquisitions in each case without the prior written consent of the company s lenders 
the company s credit facility also requires the company to maintain specified financial covenants relating to asset coverage  fixed charge coverage  and debt coverage 
the company s ability to satisfy these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control  and the company cannot assure you that it will meet these ratios 
default under the company s credit facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
the company has pledged substantially all of its assets  including the stock of certain of the company s subsidiaries  to secure the debt under the company s credit facility 
if the lenders declare amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be due  the lenders could proceed against those assets 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business if the creditors determine to exercise their rights 
the company also may incur future debt obligations that might subject the company to restrictive covenants that could affect its financial and operational flexibility  restrict the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock or subject the company to other events of default 
from time to time the company may require consents or waivers from its lenders to permit actions that are prohibited by its credit facility 
if in the future the company s lenders refuse to provide waivers of the company s credit facility s restrictive covenants and or financial ratios  then the company may be in default under its credit facility  and the company may be prohibited from undertaking actions that are necessary or desirable to maintain and expand its business 
the company s employees or subcontractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities 
the company is exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur 
in addition  from time to time the company enters into arrangements with subcontractors and joint venture partners to bid on and execute particular contracts or programs and it is exposed to the risk that fraud or other misconduct or improper activities by such persons may occur 
misconduct by employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners could include intentional failures to comply with federal laws  federal government procurement regulations or the terms of contracts that the company receives  or failures to disclose unauthorized or unsuccessful activities to the company 
these actions could lead to civil  criminal  and or administrative penalties including fines  imprisonment  suspension and or debarment from performing federal government contracts and reputational harm 
misconduct by the company s employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners could also involve the improper collection  handling or use of the company s customers sensitive or classified information  which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to the company s reputation 
the company has from time to time experienced occurrences of misconduct and improper activities by its employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners 
it is not always possible to deter misconduct by the company s employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners 
under certain circumstances  conduct of the company s employees can be imputed to the mantech subsidiary for which they work and the conduct of mantech subsidiaries can be imputed to mantech international corporation with the consequence that mantech international corporation could be subject to sanctions and penalties for actions taken by its subsidiaries and or the employees of its subsidiaries 
the precautions the company takes to prevent and detect such activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses and such misconduct by employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners could result in serious civil or criminal penalties or sanctions or reputational harm to the company 
item properties all of the company s facilities are leased in close proximity to its customers 
since  the company has leased its corporate headquarters office building in fairfax  virginia 
the lease on this facility expires in march as of december   the company leased additional operating facilities throughout the metropolitan washington  dc area and facilities in other parts of the united states 
the company also has employees working at customer sites throughout the united states and in other countries 
item legal proceedings the company is subject to certain legal proceedings  government audits  investigations  claims and disputes that arise in the ordinary course of its business 
like most large government defense contractors  the company s contract costs are audited and reviewed on a continual basis by an in house staff of auditors from the defense contract auditing agency 
in addition to these routine audits  the company is subject from time to time to audits and investigations by other agencies of the federal government 
these audits and investigations are conducted to determine if the company s performance and administration of its government contracts are compliant with contractual requirements and applicable federal statutes and regulations 
an audit or investigation may result in a finding that the company s performance and administration is compliant or  alternatively  may result in the government initiating proceedings against the company or its employees  including administrative proceedings seeking repayment of monies  suspension and or debarment from doing business with the federal government or a particular agency  or civil or criminal proceedings seeking penalties and or fines 
audits and investigations conducted by the federal government frequently span several years 
on june   chbp  ltd  a customer of mantech environmental corporation  the company s former environmental consulting and remediation business  filed suit in the rd district court of harris county texas against a number of parties alleging initially a total of million in damages from soil and groundwater contamination caused by the defendants while occupying a commercial business center owned by chbp  ltd 
as set forth in the most recent pleadings in this case  the total damages alleged were increased to million 
on november   some of the defendants in this suit filed a third party complaint against mantech environmental corporation  alleging that services provided by the company s subsidiary to chbp  ltd 
caused or contributed to the alleged contamination of the property 
on april   chbp  ltd 
amended their suit to assert a direct claim against mantech environmental corporation 
in november  the company reached a mediated settlement in this case  which was covered by pre existing reserves and or insurance proceeds 
the company decided to discontinue the operation of the commercial business performed by mantech environmental corporation 
although the company cannot predict the outcomes of the legal proceedings  government audits  investigations  claims and disputes to which it is currently subject  based on the information now available to it  the company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on its business  prospects  financial condition or operating results
