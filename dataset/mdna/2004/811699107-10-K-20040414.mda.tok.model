item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements  related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking information due to competitive factors and other factors discussed under certain risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of systems  known as video storage systems that automate the management and distribution of long form video streams  such as movies or other feature presentations  and short form video streams  such as advertisements 
we have three reportable segments broadband systems  broadcast systems and services 
the broadband systems segment includes products  such as our digital advertising and video on demand products that digitally manage  store and distribute digital video for cable system operators and telecommunications companies 
the broadcast systems segment includes products for the storage  archival  on air playback of advertising and other video programming for the broadcast television industry 
our system revenues are comprised of sales of our broadband and broadcast systems 
the service segment is comprised of revenue related to product development contracts  installation  training  product maintenance and technical support for all of the above systems  and delivery of content which is distributed by the broadband product segment 
we have experienced fluctuations in our systems revenues from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the receipt of customer orders and the shipment of those orders 
the factors that impact the timing of the receipt of customer orders include among other factors the customer s receipt of authorized signatures on their purchase orders  the budgetary approvals within the customer s company for capital purchases  and the ability to process the purchase order within the customer s organization in a timely manner 
factors that may impact the shipment of customer orders include the availability of material to produce the product  the time required to produce and test the system before delivery  and the customer s required delivery date 
the delay in the timing of receipt and shipment of any one customer order can result in significant fluctuations in our revenue reported on a quarterly basis 
our operating results are significantly influenced by a number of factors  including the mix of products sold and services provided  pricing  costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations during the fiscal year 
we price our products and services based upon our costs as well as in consideration of the prices of competitive products and services in the marketplace 
the costs of our products primarily consist of the costs of components and subassemblies that have generally declined from product introduction to product maturity 
as a result of the growth of our business  our operating expenses have historically increased in the areas of research and development  selling and marketing  customer service and support and administration 
despite the limited economic recovery  we expect that our cable and broadcast customers may still have limited capital spending budgets as we believe they are dependent on advertising revenues to fund their capital equipment purchases 
accordingly  we expect our financial results to vary from quarter to quarter and our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
our ability to continue to generate revenues within the markets that our products are sold and to generate cash from operations and net income is dependent on several factors which include market acceptance of the products and services offered by our customers and increased subscriber usage and demand for these products and services  selection by our customers of our products and services versus the products and services being offered by our competitors  our ability to introduce new products to the market in a timely manner and to meet the demands of the market for new products and product enhancements  our ability to maintain gross margins from the sale of our products and services at a level that will provide us with cash to fund our operations given the pricing pressures within the market and the costs of materials to manufacture our products  and our ability to control operating costs given the fluctuations that we have experienced with revenues from quarter to quarter 
in fiscal  our total revenues grew to million compared to growth in fiscal the continued growth in revenues is primarily attributed to our broadband segment  in which video on demand systems revenues rose to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal this significant growth in systems revenues reflects the expanding deployment of residential video on demand systems throughout the united states of america by cable operators 
we expect video on demand systems revenues will also increase in fiscal  depending upon their continued acceptance in key regional domestic markets and their initial deployment throughout asia and europe 
services revenues also continued to grow  by to million in fiscal and in fiscal this sustained growth is primarily attributed to providing technical support and maintenance services to an ever expanding base of equipment installed at customer sites 
our advertising systems and our broadcast systems revenues decreased to million and to million in fiscal  respectively  which compares to decreases of and in fiscal  respectively 
we believe the decrease in advertising systems revenues reflects a decline in demand for analog advertisement systems from cable operators 
we expect sales of advertising systems to grow modestly in fiscal also  the increasing rates of decline in both advertising systems and broadcast systems revenues are attributed to the continued adverse affects from the economic slowdown in the advertising industry 
gross profits increased to in fiscal in comparison to a decrease in fiscal higher revenues and lower manufacturing and material costs per unit primarily contributed to this favorable performance  even though competitive pressures intensified and resulted in lower average selling prices per unit in fiscal we believe these competitive pressures will continue and our ability to maintain gross margins will be dependent upon achieving technological advances that will further reduce material costs 
our revenue growth  improving gross margin and reduced operating costs resulted in net income of million or per diluted share in fiscal this improvement in operating results  combined with successful working capital management  enabled us to generate million of cash from operations during fiscal in comparison to million in fiscal summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that could have been used  or if changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounting related to revenue recognition is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
in addition  our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
revenues from sales of systems and software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
installation  project management and training revenue is deferred and recognized as these services are performed 
revenue from technical support and maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements 
customers are billed for installation  project management  training  technical support and maintenance at the time of the product sale 
if a portion of the sales price is not due until installation of the system is complete  that portion of the sales price is deferred until installation is complete 
revenue from movie content services is recognized based on the volume of monthly purchases that are made by hotel guests 
revenue from product development contract services is recognized based on the efforts expended in relation to the overall expected efforts for the project 
shipping and handling costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue and cost of revenues 
our transactions frequently involve the sales of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
systems sales always include at least one year of free technical support and maintenance services 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated to all undelivered elements of the sales arrangement based upon the fair value of those elements 
the amounts allocated to project management  training  technical support and maintenance and movie content fees are based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to installation revenue is based upon standard hourly billing rates and the estimated time required to complete the service 
the amount allocated to the sale of systems reflects the residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to the undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to systems revenue 
installation  project management  and training services are not essential to the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities  are available from other vendors and the systems are standard products 
for multiple element arrangements including software licenses and services where vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value does not exist to allocate a portion of the fee to the service element  and the only undelivered element is services that do not involve significant production  modification or customization of the software  the entire arrangement is recognized as services are performed 
for transactions in which consideration  including equity instruments  is given to a customer  we account for the value of this consideration as a reduction in revenue in our consolidated statement of operations 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the fair value for each element 
we recognize revenue for systems and services only in those situations where collection from the customer is probable 
our normal payments terms are of the order due upon receipt of a customer purchase order  due upon shipment of the product to the customer and due days after shipment of the product to the customer 
our finance management regularly monitors payments from our customers and assesses any collection issues 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customer s financial condition but generally do not require collateral 
for some of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
we maintain allowances for specific doubtful accounts based on estimates of losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and record these allowances as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit assessment  and other analysis of specific customer situations 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  additional allowances may be required or established allowances may be considered unnecessary 
for example  in the year ended january   we increased our accounts receivable reserves by  as a provision against outstanding amounts owed by adelphia communications corp  which filed for bankruptcy in june in the year ended january   we reversed  of this provision as a result of events that took place during the year related to adelphia s announcement of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy and our ability to sell the adelphia receivables to a third party 
judgment is required in making these determinations and our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in fiscal  we entered into a video on demand purchase agreement and a common stock and warrant purchase agreement with a customer 
as part of these agreements  the customer was issued common stock and earned incentive common stock purchase warrants based on the number of cable subscribers being served by our equipment which had been purchased by this customer 
we determined the fair value of the common stock and the incentive common stock purchase warrants using the black scholes valuation method and amortized this fair value as an offset to gross revenue in proportion to the revenue recognized from the sale of the equipment to the customer 
the assumptions used in this valuation included a weighted average volatility factor  a dividend yield  a risk free interest rate and an expected warrant term 
if management had used another valuation method or different valuation assumptions  the fair value of the common stock and the warrants may have significantly changed  which could have materially impacted our results of operations 
during the year ended january   the customer earned the remaining common stock purchase warrants available under the agreement and we are in the process of issuing these warrants and completing a final determination of the exercise prices of the warrants 
inventories and reserves for obsolescence 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of components  subassemblies and finished products held for sale 
all of our hardware components are purchased from outside vendors 
we depend upon certain vendors for the manufacture of significant components for all of our products 
if these vendors were to become unwilling or unable to manufacture these products in required volumes  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable alternative vendors 
the inability to develop alternative sources  if required in the future  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing  finance and operations personnel monitor quarterly the inventories to determine that the carrying value is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we record a provision for net realizable value adjustments  including obsolete inventory  when an impairment is identified through the quarterly management review process 
obsolete inventory  consisting of on hand components  subassemblies and finished products  is written down to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost 
the obsolescence evaluation is based upon assumptions and estimates about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses and involves significant judgments 
for example  in the year ended january   we recorded additional inventory reserve provisions of million primarily related to management s determination that certain product development initiatives would be terminated and that the inventory purchased related to these programs could not be used 
for obsolete inventory that has been written down to its net realizable value  if there is a subsequent increase in demand for the same inventory at a higher value  we release the reserve upon sale or disposal of this inventory 
investments in affiliates 
we consolidate the balance sheets and results of operations of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we also hold minority investments in the capital stock of certain private companies having product offerings or customer relationships that are strategic to us 
these investments in affiliates include investments accounted for under the cost method and the equity method of accounting 
under the cost method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent less than a ownership interest of the equity shares of the affiliate  the investments are carried at cost and we monitor the investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in the carrying value  if necessary 
under the equity method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent to ownership of the equity securities of the affiliate  our proportionate ownership share of the earnings or losses of the affiliate is included in equity income loss in earnings of affiliates in our consolidated statement of operations 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether an investment is more accurately reflected using the cost or equity method 
we review the fair value of our investments in affiliates on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest a decline in the value of the asset 
the carrying value of our investments in affiliates may be affected by the affiliate s ability to obtain adequate funding and execute its business plans  general market conditions  industry considerations specific to the affiliate s business  and other factors 
the inability of an affiliate to obtain future funding or successfully execute its business plan could adversely affect our equity earnings of the affiliate in the periods affected by those events 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the affiliates could result in equity losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments in affiliates that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
valuation of long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards board no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which we adopted on february   the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internal and external  that may suggest an asset is not recoverable that is  the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset s use and eventual disposition 
factors we consider important that could trigger the impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decrease in the market value of the long lived asset  significant adverse change to the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  significant decline in our technological value as compared to the market  and a reduction in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
in determining expected future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
our cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
accounting for income taxes 
we record income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance if the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets is reduced based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence 
significant management judgment is required in determining our income tax expense benefit  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to indications that they may not be fully realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating sufficient pre tax book income in future periods 
through january   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realization as a result of cumulative historical pre tax book losses 
we will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
if we generate sufficient future pre tax book income  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding increase in net income would be reported in the future 
accounting for contingencies 
we are subject to certain claims and litigation including proceedings under government laws and regulations and commercial disputes relating to our operations  including ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business 
we review and determine which liabilities  if any arising from these claims and litigations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
loss contingency liabilities are recorded for these contingencies based on careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside counsel when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
these liabilities may change in the future due to new developments relating to each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy 
in the year ended january   we recorded charges of million associated with an unfavourable jury verdict in connection with the litigation with ncube 
we believe that our reserve of million at january  related to this litigation is our best estimate of our exposure based on information currently available 
we believe that any liability ultimately incurred after pursuing all legal options will not likely exceed this reserve  except for on going legal fees associated with the dispute and additional interest on the awarded damages  which will be charged to operations 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital or incurring debt 
other than our equity investment in odg see liquidity and capital resources  we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
year ended january  compared to the year ended january  systems revenues 
our systems revenues consist of sales of our broadband and broadcast products 
systems revenues increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  revenues from the broadband segment  which accounted for of total revenues in the year ended january  and of total revenues in the year ended january  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal advertising system revenues were million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended january  video on demand systems revenues increased to million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended january  revenues from video on demand systems for the years ended january  and were reduced by the amortization of and million  respectively  related to the deferred equity discount associated with the comcast equity investment 
the increase in broadband revenues is primarily attributable to the increased deployment of residential video on demand systems in the united states by cable operators  offset in part by a decline in the number of expansion systems purchased by united states cable system operators for advertising insertion 
broadcast system segment revenues were million in the year ended january  compared to million in the year ended january  the decrease in broadcast revenues for the year ended january  was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures by broadcast companies that we believe reflects declining advertising revenues generated by those companies 
we expect future revenue growth  if any  to come principally from our video on demand and broadcast system products as cable and telecommunications companies continue to offer new applications for their customers and the market for digital video servers within the broadcast industry continues to expand 
as revenues from broadcast and interactive television products increase  the advertising products will become a smaller portion of total system revenues 
however  we believe that there will be a continuing demand for expansions to existing advertising insertion systems within the united states and increasing demand for advertising insertion systems in an on demand environment as video on demand becomes more available to subscribers 
services revenues 
our services revenues consist of fees for installation  training  project management  product maintenance  technical support services  product development contracts and movie content fees 
our services revenues increased to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  this increase in services revenues primarily resulted from the annual renewals of technical support and maintenance service contracts  price increases on certain technical support and maintenance services and the impact of a growing installed base of systems 
revenues from our wholly owned subsidiary  digital video arts  were  in the year ended january  and million in the year ended january  revenues from services are expected to continue to grow as the installed base of our products increases and revenues from digital video arts continue to grow due to additional development contracts and new product offerings 
for the years ended january  and january   certain customers each accounted for more than of our total revenues 
single customers each accounted for and of total revenues in the year ended january  and and of total revenues in the year ended january  revenue from these customers was primarily in the broadband segment 
we believe that a significant amount of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers 
international sales accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the years ended january  and january   respectively 
no individual country except the us accounted for more than of total revenue 
we expect that international sales will remain a significant portion of our business in the future and expect to obtain several new video on demand orders in europe and asia during fiscal year as of january   substantially all sales of our products were made in united states dollars 
therefore  we have not experienced  nor do we expect to experience in the near term  any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations 
systems gross profit 
costs of systems revenues consist primarily of the cost of purchased components and subassemblies  labor and overhead relating to the final assembly and testing of complete systems and related expenses 
costs of systems revenues increased to million in the year ended january  as compared to million in the year ended january  in the year ended january   the increase in the costs of systems revenues primarily reflects higher systems revenues within the video on demand products 
we expect the cost of systems revenues for the video on demand products within the broadband segment to decrease as a percentage of revenues as the revenue level increases and we improve our manufacturing and material purchasing efficiencies 
systems gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues was and in the years ended january  and january   respectively 
gross profit for the broadband segment increased from of revenues for the year ended january  to of revenues for the year ended january  the increase in broadband gross profit percentages is primarily due to higher revenues and lower material costs on certain components due to technological advances offset in part by the amortization related to the deferred equity discount associated with the comcast equity investment and the million inventory reserve provision related to the termination of certain product development initiatives 
gross profit for the broadcast segment decreased from to for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the decrease in the broadcast gross profit percentage is primarily due to lower revenues and increased pricing pressures from competitors 
services gross profit 
costs of services revenues consist primarily of labor  materials and overhead relating to the installation  training  product maintenance and technical support services provided by us and costs associated with providing movie content services 
costs of services revenues decreased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  due to lower salaries and expenses related to our united kingdom and hotel product operations 
services gross profit as a percentage of services revenue was in the year ended january  and in the year ended january  the increase in services gross profit was primarily a result of higher revenues and a slight decrease in cost of services 
we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in gross profit percentage in the future due to the timing of revenues from technical support and other services to support the growing installed base of systems and the timing of costs associated with our ongoing investment required to continue to expand our service organization to support our installed base of systems and our new products 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the compensation of development personnel  depreciation of development and test equipment and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
research and development expenses remained relatively flat at million  or of total revenues  in the year ended january  compared to million  or of total revenues  in the year ended january  we expect that research and development expenses will increase to in the fiscal year as we continue our development and support of new and existing products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses  including sales commissions  travel expenses and certain promotional expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million or of total revenues  in the year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the year ended january  this increase is primarily due to increased sales commissions on higher revenues and higher travel costs related to increased direct sales efforts 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the compensation of executive  finance  human resource and administrative personnel  legal and accounting services and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
in the year ended january   general and administrative expenses of million  or of total revenues  included the million provision for litigation and related expenses resulting from the ncube jury verdict see further explanation below under year ended january  compared to year ended january  
general and administrative expenses for the year ended january  of million  or of total revenues  were million lower than the year ended january  primarily due to the provision from the ncube jury verdict in fiscal and lower legal costs associated with this patent infringement litigation in the year ended january  in addition  in the year ended january   we reversed  of the  provision recorded in the year ended january  for outstanding amounts owed by adelphia as a result of events that took place during fiscal related to adelphia s announcement of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy and our ability to sell the adelphia receivables to a third party 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was approximately million in the year ended january  and million in the year ended january  the increase in interest income primarily reflects higher average invested cash balances throughout the year and higher interest rates earned on the invested cash balance 
interest expense was approximately  in the year ended january  and  in the year ended january  equity income loss in earnings of affiliates 
equity loss in earning of affiliates was  in the year ended january  and equity income in earnings of affiliates was  in the year ended january  for the year ended january   the equity income in earnings of affiliates consists of our proportionate ownership share of the earnings of on demand group limited odg under the equity method of accounting 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate was and for the years ended january  and  respectively 
during the year ended january   we determined that our deferred tax assets would not be realizable for financial reporting purposes as a result of the cumulative pre tax book losses recorded over the previous fiscal years and the significant loss incurred in fiscal mainly as a result of the charge to operations recorded in the first quarter of fiscal related to the unfavorable jury verdict in the ncube litigation 
during the year ended january   we recorded income tax expense of million as a valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets as of that date 
through january   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realization as a result of cumulative historical pre tax losses 
we will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
if we generate sufficient future pre tax income  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding increase in net income would be reported in the future 
year ended january  compared to the year ended january  systems revenues 
systems revenues increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  revenues from the broadband segment  which accounted for of total revenues in the year ended january  and of total revenues in the year ended january   increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal digital advertising system revenues were million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended january  video on demand revenues increased to million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended january  video on demand revenue for the years ended january  and were reduced by the amortization of and million  respectively  related to the deferred equity discount associated with the comcast equity investment 
the increase in broadband revenues is primarily attributable to the increased deployment of residential video on demand systems in the united states for cable operators  offset in part by a decline in the number of expansion systems purchased by united states cable system operators for digital advertising 
broadcast system segment revenues were million in the year ended january  compared to million in the year ended january  the decrease in broadcast revenues for the year ended january  was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures by broadcast companies that we believe reflects declining advertising revenues earned by those companies 
services revenues 
our services revenues increased to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  this increase in services revenues primarily resulted from the annual renewals of technical support and maintenance service contracts  price increases on certain technical support and maintenance services and the impact of a growing installed base of systems 
for the years ended january  and january   certain customers each accounted for more than of our total revenues 
single customers each accounted for  and of total revenues in the year ended january  and and of total revenues in the year ended january  revenue from these customers was primarily in the broadband segment 
international sales accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the twelve month periods ended january  and january   respectively 
no individual country accounted for more than of total revenue 
as of january   substantially all sales of our products were made in united states dollars 
therefore  we have not experienced any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations or liquidity 
systems gross profit 
costs of systems revenues increased to million in the year ended january  as compared to million in the year ended january  in the year ended january   the increase in costs of systems revenues reflects higher systems revenue and relatively higher material costs within the video on demand products 
systems gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues was and in the year ended january  and january   respectively 
the decrease in systems gross profit in the year ended january  was primarily due to the shift within the broadband segment from product sales of higher gross profit ad insertion systems to lower gross profit video on demand systems 
gross profit for the broadband segment decreased from of revenues for the year ended january  to of revenues for the year ended january  and gross profit for the broadcast segment decreased from to for the year ended january  and the year ended january   respectively 
services gross profit 
costs of services revenues increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january   primarily as a result of increased revenues and the costs associated with our hiring and training additional service personnel to provide worldwide support for the growing installed base of broadband and broadcast systems and costs associated with providing movie content 
services gross profit as a percentage of services revenue was in the year ended january  and in the year ended january  improvements in the services gross profit in the year ended january  reflect the economies of scale resulting from the increase in the installed base of systems under maintenance service contracts and price increases on certain annual technical support and maintenance services 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from approximately million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  the increase in the dollar amount was primarily attributable to the hiring and contracting of additional development personnel which reflects our continuing investment in new products  prototype expenses associated with these development efforts and outside fees related to the certification of our products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  this increase is primarily due to increased sales commissions on higher revenues  higher travel costs related to increased direct sales efforts  and higher marketing expenses specifically for tradeshow and other promotional activities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended january  increased million over the year ended january  this increase is primarily due to the recording of charges of million in fiscal associated with an unfavorable jury verdict in connection with the litigation with ncube  an additional million in on going legal fees and accrued interest related to the above litigation and the increase in accounts receivable reserves  principally a  provision against outstanding amounts owed by adelphia communications corp  which filed for bankruptcy in june the charges recorded for the ncube jury verdict totaled million and included provisions for estimated damages and enhanced damages relating to the shipments of the accused video on demand vod systems through april   legal expenses  including estimated ncube legal fees and million of our legal costs that had been included in other assets as of january   and accrued interest on total damages 
the legal expenses paid through january  of million includes the write off of million of seachange deferred legal fees included in other assets as of january  and fees of million incurred during fiscal related to pre verdict legal services 
the following is a summary of the accrued litigation reserve through january estimated damages on the accused vod shipments through april  estimated treble damages on the accused vod shipments through april  estimated legal fees including write off of capitalized legal costs and ncube legal fees accrued interest on estimated damages and treble damages through april  total charges recorded as of april  additional accrued interest on estimated damages and treble damages through january  adjustment to litigation reserve based on march  court order and april  court filing legal expenses paid through january  accrued litigation reserve as of january  this reserve reflects our best estimate of our exposure based on information currently available 
however  we believe that any liability ultimately incurred after pursuing all legal options will not likely exceed the provision  as adjusted in the fourth quarter  except for on going legal fees associated with the dispute and additional interest on the awarded damages  which will be charged to operations 
other than the payment of our legal fees  any payment of the other amounts recorded as charges will only occur in the event that the jury verdict is upheld in appeal 
we plan to contest the verdict  the claim construction and the denial of any of its post trial motions by appeal to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
any injunctive relief against us will not be determined until after appeal 
in the event that the court issues an injunction prohibiting us from selling the accused video on demand products  we believe that such injunction would have a minimal impact on our ability to ship products and meet customer demands because we have implemented a revised version of the software which we believe does not infringe the ncube patent 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was approximately  in the year ended january  and interest income was approximately million in the year ended january  the increase in interest income reflects invested cash balances resulting from our public stock offering which closed on january  interest expense was approximately  in the year ended january  and  in the year ended january  the decrease in interest expense was due to the repayment of bank debt in fiscal year income tax expense benefit 
as a result of the cumulative pre tax book losses over recent fiscal years  including the significant loss incurred in fiscal  mainly as the result of the charge to operations recorded in the first quarter of fiscal related to the unfavorable jury verdict in the ncube litigation  we determined that our deferred tax assets as of april  would not be realized for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  we recorded income tax expense of million  as a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets as of that date 
in addition  we did not record any income tax benefit for the operating losses generated during fiscal our effective tax rate was and for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was largely due to the income tax expense recorded as a valuation allowance in the first quarter of fiscal quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited financial information for the quarterly periods in the years ended january  and january  the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results  and we believe that period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior year amounts to the current year presentation 
three months ended april  july  october  january  april  july  october  january  in thousands  except per share amounts revenue gross profit operating expenses net income loss earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share diluted we have experienced significant variations in revenues  expenses and operating results from quarter to quarter and such variations are likely to continue 
a significant portion of our revenues have been generated from a limited number of customers  and it is difficult to predict the timing of future orders and shipments to these and other customers 
customers can cancel or reschedule shipments  and development or production difficulties could delay shipments 
during the quarterly periods outlined above  we experienced variations in our revenues from quarter to quarter primarily related to the significant growth of our video on demand products in the broadband segment and the decline in revenues from our advertising and broadcast products 
we have also experienced significant variations in our quarterly systems gross margins 
changes in pricing policies  the product mix  the timing and significance of new product introductions and product enhancements  and fluctuations in the number of systems affects manufacturing efficiencies and  accordingly  gross profits 
quarterly services gross margins have historically fluctuated significantly because installation and training service revenue varies by quarter while the related costs are relatively consistent by quarter 
operating expenses also vary with the number  timing and significance of new product and product enhancement introductions by us and our competitors  increased competition  the gain or loss of significant customers  the hiring of new personnel and general economic conditions 
during the quarterly periods outlined above  we experienced certain fluctuations in our operating expenses 
our selling and marketing costs fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of large tradeshows that take place in the first and third quarter of the year and significant promotional costs that are incurred for new product introductions 
our general and administrative expenses were significantly impacted during fiscal year by the unfavorable jury verdict in the ncube patent infringement litigation  which included a million charge in the first quarter of fiscal and a million reversal of a portion of this charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal and on going legal costs associated with this litigation 
all of the above factors are difficult for us to forecast  and these or other factors may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
only a small portion of our expenses vary with revenues in the short term and there would likely be a material adverse effect on our operating results if future revenues are lower than expectations 
based upon all of the forgoing  we believe that quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and  therefore  should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily with the proceeds from sales of our common stock  borrowings and cash flows generated from operations 
cash and cash equivalents increased million from million at january  to million at january  largely due to cash provided by operating activities 
working capital  excluding long term marketable securities  increased from approximately million at january  to approximately million at january net cash provided from operating activities for the year ended january  and january  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended january  was the result of net income of million adjusted for non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization of million and the changes in certain operating assets and liabilities 
the significant changes in assets and liabilities that provided cash from operations included a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  and an increase in income taxes payable of million 
these items that generated cash from operations were offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million 
our increase in cash provided from operating activity in fiscal included significant cash collections from accounts receivables of million compared to million in fiscal we expect that the video on demand products within the broadband segment will continue to require a significant amount of cash to fund future product development and demonstration equipment and to meet higher forecasted revenue levels 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended january  and million for the year ended january  investment activity consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities of million  capital expenditures of million and an additional investment in an affiliated company of approximately  offset by sales of marketable securities of million 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended january  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million for the year ended january  in the year ended january   the cash provided by financing activities included approximately million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by the repayment of borrowings under the equipment line of credit and capital lease obligations of  in october  we entered into a million revolving line of credit with a bank that expired in october in december  we renewed the revolving line of credit with that bank for a two year period and increased the committed amount from million to million 
loans made under this revolving line of credit bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the bank s prime rate which was on january  borrowings under this line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the loan agreement requires that we provide the bank with certain periodic financial reports and comply with certain financial ratios including a minimum level of earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization on a trailing twelve month basis  when amounts are outstanding under the loan agreement 
as of january   we were in compliance with the financial covenants 
there are currently no amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
in october  we entered into an agreement with a bank to finance million of the construction costs related to the purchase and renovation of a manufacturing mill in new hampshire that we previously purchased in february upon occupancy of the building in november  the loan converted into two promissory notes whereby we paid principal and interest based upon a fixed interest rate of per annum over a five and ten year period 
borrowings under the loan were secured by the land and buildings of the renovated mill 
the loan agreement required that we provide the bank with certain periodic financial reports and comply with certain annual financial ratios on an annual basis 
in october  we repaid the remaining  outstanding principal and interest under the loan 
in october  seachange entered into a subscription and shareholders agreement the subscription agreement with odg  a company incorporated in england and wales that provides video on demand services in europe 
pursuant to the subscription agreement  seachange invested million uk pounds sterling approximately million in exchange for  ordinary shares of odg representing approximately of the total outstanding capital stock of odg on that date 
as part of the subscription agreement  seachange had committed to purchase additional ordinary shares and preference shares of odg from odg and certain of its existing shareholders under certain conditions in the agreement 
seachange also entered into a business development agreement with odg for a minimum of five years whereby odg agreed to exclusively purchase and to market and promote seachange s video on demand systems and software worldwide in connection with furnishing video on demand services to odg s customers 
in october  seachange and odg amended the subscription agreement to remove seachange s commitment to purchase additional ordinary and preference shares from odg and certain of its existing shareholders 
as part of the amended subscription agreement  seachange has committed to loan odg up to million uk pounds sterling approximately million payable in tranches of  uk pounds sterling or multiples thereof 
odg s ability to draw down the loan is subject to certain conditions including odg s execution of a carriage agreement with a cable operator prior to december  and its achievement of certain financial targets 
any outstanding loan amounts would mature five years from the date of the first draw down and interest is payable quarterly at the rate of per annum 
no amounts are outstanding as of january  in december  seachange purchased  common shares of odg from its principal owners for  uk pounds sterling approximately 
the following table reflects our current and contingent contractual obligations to make potential future payments in thousands payment due by period s total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years non cancelable lease obligations purchase obligations total it is typical for us to experience fluctuations in our monthly operating results primarily due to the timing of receiving customer orders and the related shipment of these customer orders 
as a result of these monthly fluctuations  we may experience an increase in our inventories as a result of procurement of both short and long lead components for anticipated orders for both our product segments  a decrease in our accounts payable balance primarily due to the timing of payments for materials purchased for prior month shipments  a decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of customer shipments or customer deposits and a resulting increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that existing funds combined with available borrowings under the revolving line of credit and cash provided by future operating activities are adequate to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and other contractual obligations for the foreseeable future  including at least the next months 
effects of inflation our management believes that financial results have not been significantly impacted by inflation and price changes 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities and  in december  issued a revision to that interpretation 
fin no 
r replaces fin no 
and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
a variable interest entity vie is defined as a an ownership  contractual or monetary interest in an entity where the ability to influence financial decisions is not proportional to the investment interest  or b an entity lacking the invested capital sufficient to fund future activities without the support of a third party 
fin no 
r establishes standards for determining under what circumstances vies should be consolidated with their primary beneficiary  including those to which the usual condition for consolidation does not apply 
we will adopt fin no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal we continue to evaluate the impact of fin r on our financial condition and results of operations 
based on our preliminary analysis of the impact of fin r  we believe that it is reasonably possible that we will be required to consolidate our equity investment in odg when the consolidation requirements become effective in the first quarter ending april  we believe that we hold a majority of the related financial risks  despite our lack of voting control over odg 
as of january   odg had net assets of approximately million 
for the year ended january   odg had revenues of approximately million and a net income of  as a result of the adoption of fin r  we may be required to include an additional million in assets and  in liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
our maximum exposure to losses  however  as a result of our involvement with odg is million  consisting of our investment in odg see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf requires revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to be divided into separate units of accounting 
if the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria  arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for separate units of accounting 
the guidance in eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas  which establishes standards for how an issuer of financial instruments classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  in november  the fasb deferred the classification and measurement provisions for certain mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests for an indefinite period of time 
the adoption of sfas had no impact on our financial position or operating results 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which supersedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
rescinds accounting guidance in sab no 
related to multiple element arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the adoption of sab no 
had no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposure has been related to local currency revenue  as most of our revenues are in us dollars  and operating expenses in europe and asia 
historically  we have not hedged specific currency exposures as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions have not been material to date 
at january  and january   we had approximately million and outstanding related to variable rate us dollar denominated debt 
the carrying value of these short term borrowings approximated fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the interest rate  interest expense on these short term borrowings would increase by approximately  for the twelve month period ended january  as there were no amounts outstanding at january  related to variable rate debt there was no interest rate exposure 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables and trade payables approximate fair value at january  due to the short maturities of these instruments 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
our cash and marketable securities include cash equivalents  which we consider to be investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at january   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
as a result  we do not currently hedge these market risk exposures 
at january   we had million in short term marketable securities and million in long term marketable securities
