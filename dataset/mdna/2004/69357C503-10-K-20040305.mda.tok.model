critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
however  certain of the company s accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of its financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management 
as a result  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
accounting policies that involve the use of estimates that meet both of the following criteria are considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
first  the accounting estimate requires the company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time that the accounting estimate is made 
second  alternate estimates in the current period  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely in future periods  would have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents in addition to estimates that meet the critical estimate criteria  the company also makes many other accounting estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
all estimates  whether or not deemed critical  affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  information available prior to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this information forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known  including changes in those estimates not deemed critical 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve its more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the development and selection of accounting estimates  including those deemed critical  and the associated disclosures in this form k have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on the invoice basis except with respect to its meridian business unit and channel revenue  a division of accounts payable services  where revenue is recognized on the cash basis in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission in sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
clients are invoiced for a contractually specified percentage of amounts recovered when it has been determined that they have received economic value generally through credits taken against existing accounts payable due to the involved vendors or refund checks received from those vendors  and when the following criteria are met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b services have been rendered  c the fee billed to the client is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
the determination that each of the aforementioned criteria are met  particularly the determination of the timing of economic benefit being received by the client and the determination that collectibility is reasonably assured  requires the application of significant judgment by management and a misapplication of this judgment could result in inappropriate recognition of revenue 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of its clients to make required payments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the allowances on a periodic basis 
the valuation includes  but is not limited to  historical loss experience  the aging of current accounts receivable balances and provisions for adverse situations that may affect a client s ability to pay 
if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve  adjustments are made to the reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to revision as more information becomes available 
if the financial condition of the company s clients were to deteriorate  or their operating climates were to change  resulting in an impairment of either their ability or willingness to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if the company s estimate of required allowances for doubtful accounts is determined to be insufficient  it could result in decreased operating income in the period such determination is made 
conversely  if a client subsequently remits cash for an accounts receivable balance which has previously been written off by establishing a partial or full reserve  it could result in increased operating income in the period in which the payment is received 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of december   the company had a consolidated goodwill asset of million relating to the accounts payable services segment and other intangible assets of million  including intangible assets with indefinite useful lives of million  relating to the accounts payable services segment see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 

table of contents as discussed above  during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded impairment charges of million  pre tax  related to the impairment of goodwill  impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives and impairment of internally developed software 
the goodwill impairment valuation is a two part test 
first  the fair value of each reporting unit is developed and compared with its recorded book value 
if the fair value is less than book value  a second test is required 
the determination of any potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets depends on several underlying factors and assumptions  including the overall value of the company and its reporting units  as well as the cost of capital and specific characteristics of these intangible assets 
goodwill  by definition  is the residual amount in a transaction after value is ascribed to all other identifiable tangible and intangible assets 
the implied fair value of goodwill will vary based on the overall value of the reporting unit  the number of identifiable tangible and intangible assets and the value ascribed to these assets 
in an assessment for impairment of goodwill in which a reporting unit fails the first step of the impairment test  the value ascribed to various internally created intangible assets not recognized and recorded in the company s balance sheet could cause a potentially higher goodwill impairment 
this is due to the fact that  by ascribing value to non recorded intangible assets in the theoretical purchase price allocation required by sfas no 
a lesser residual amount is calculated  thus implying a lower fair value of goodwill 
similar factors also impact the impairment of certain other intangible assets as these are often based on the level of revenue growth and profitability of the company  or of the reporting unit in which they reside  and their contributed operating cash flows 
impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is also further impacted by changes to the cost of capital since these assets are tested on a fair value basis under sfas no 
as the cost of capital increases  all other things being equal  the implied fair value of the indefinite useful life intangible assets will be lower and may potentially result in impairment 
impairment testing of amortizable intangible assets is not impacted by changes to the cost of capital because it is based on gross or undiscounted cash flows 
to the extent that management or its independent valuation advisors misjudges or miscalculates any of the critical factors necessary to determine whether or not there is a goodwill or other intangible assets impairment  or if any of the company s goodwill or other intangible assets are accurately determined to be impaired  future earnings could be materially adversely impacted 
income taxes 
the company s reported effective tax rate approximated a benefit  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate is based on historical and anticipated future taxable income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to the company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the company s tax positions 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the company s effective tax rate reflected in its consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k is different than that reported in its tax returns 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on the company s tax returns  and some are timing differences  such as depreciation expense 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the company s tax returns in future years for which it has already recorded the tax benefit in the income statement 
the company establishes valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that it believes are more likely than not to be realized 
these valuation allowances are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or expense for which a deduction has already been taken on the company s tax returns but has not yet been recognized as an expense in its consolidated financial statements 
the company s effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that it considers appropriate 
this rate is then applied to the annual operating results 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or one 
table of contents time item recognized in the company s operating results  such as impairment charges recognized in the fourth quarter of  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded concurrent with the unusual or one time item 
the derivation of the effective tax rate  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any required valuation allowances is inherently subjective  as it requires the use of highly complex estimates and assumptions that are susceptible to revision as more information becomes available 
as of december   the company s consolidated balance sheet included in item of this form k reflects net deferred income tax assets of million million current and million long term 
while the company has considered anticipated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or any portion of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
additionally  to the extent that management misjudges or miscalculates any of the critical factors necessary to determine the effective tax rate and the tax rate for one time charges  current period earnings could be misstated 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated years ended december  statements of operations data revenues cost of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses impairment charges operating income loss interest expense  net earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change income taxes earnings loss from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change discontinued operations earnings loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes gain loss on disposal retention of discontinued operations including operating results for phase out period  net of income taxes earnings loss from discontinued operations earnings loss before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change  net of income taxes net earnings loss 
table of contents the company has two reportable operating segments  the accounts payable services segment and meridian vat reclaim see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
accounts payable services revenues 
accounts payable services revenues for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions domestic accounts payable services revenue retail commercial international accounts payable services revenue total accounts payable services revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the company experienced a decline in revenues for domestic retail accounts payable services 
this decline was primarily the result of a revenues lost in as certain larger clients of the post merger prg schultz combined operation utilized other recovery audit service providers for a portion of their overall needs  b revenues lost in after one of the company s larger clients filed for chapter bankruptcy reorganization on april   c a generally weak retailing environment in which aggregate client purchasing volumes have been depressed  d changes in the claims approval and processing patterns in some of the company s largest retail accounts whereby the elapsed time between claim identification by the company and claim recovery by our clients has been elongated and some claims have even lapsed as unrecoverable due to additional challenges associated with the passage of time  and e reduced claims due to improvements in some clients internal recovery capabilities 
the company believes that well publicized inquiries during by the united states securities and exchange commission into the accounting by retailers for vendor supplied promotional allowances have caused many of its largest clients to slow the approval and processing of claims against vendors as related policies and procedures are re examined 
the company believes that this trend will most likely continue into revenues from the company s domestic commercial accounts payable services clients also declined during compared to the year over year decreases were largely due to fewer audit starts as a result of the nature of the commercial audit cycle  as discussed further below 
also contributing to the decrease in revenues from commercial clients is the maturing of the market for providing basic scope recovery audit services which typically entails acquisition from the client of limited purchase data and an audit focus on a select few recovery categories to commercial entities in the united states 
to date  basic scope audit recovery services have tended to be either one time with no subsequent repeat or rotational in nature with different divisions of a given client often audited in pre arranged annual sequences 
accordingly  revenues derived from a given client may change markedly from period to period 
the company believes that the market for providing basic scope recovery audit services to commercial entities in the united states is reaching maturity with the existence of many competitors and increasing pricing pressures 
until and unless the company can convert a substantial number of its current domestic commercial accounts payable services clients to broad scope audits which typically entail a vast expansion of recovery categories reviewed by the company s auditors  or sell and deliver such services to new clients  revenues derived from domestic commercial accounts payable services clients are likely to be adversely impacted due to intense and ongoing competitive pressures with respect to the historical basic scope service model 
the increase in revenues from domestic accounts payable services operations for the year ended december  compared to the same period of was primarily due to clients gained through the company s january  acquisitions of the businesses of hsa texas and affiliates 

table of contents the increase in revenues from international accounts payable services for the year ended december   compared to the same period of the prior year  is primarily attributable to increased revenues generated by the company s canadian operations combined with increased revenues from one large client acquired as part of the company s january  acquisitions of the businesses of hsa texas and affiliates for which the company provides airline ticket revenue recovery audit services  as well as increased revenues generated by the company s asian operations 
the company s canadian operations experienced increased revenues period over period as a result of a strengthening of the local currency to the us dollar when compared to currency rates for the same period of the prior year 
the increase in year over year revenues generated by airline ticket revenue recovery audit services was due to a change in the company s contract arrangement with one large client and an increase in the number of categories on which the company has been able to write claims 
the increased revenues year over year experienced by the asian operations resulted from the fact that during the quarter ended march   the company recorded no revenues from its asian operations due to certain transitional considerations associated with the acquisitions of the businesses of hsa texas and affiliates 
partially offsetting these increases in international revenues were declines in revenues from the company s latin american and european operations 
revenues from the company s latin american operations were down year over year primarily due to decreases in revenues generated from its client base 
the decline in revenues from european accounts  primarily within the united kingdom  was due to a decrease in revenues generated from the existing client base as a result of a year over year change in client mix 
partially offsetting this decline was a strengthening of the local currency to the us dollar during when compared to currency rates for the same period of the prior year 
the growth in revenues from the international accounts payable services operations for the year ended december  compared to the same period of was consistent with the growth in revenues from domestic accounts payable services operations for the same period and was also mainly driven by the company s january  acquisitions of the businesses of hsa texas and affiliates 
the international operations acquired as part of the acquisitions had a client base that was predominately resident in europe and canada  where the majority of the year over year increase in revenues from international accounts payable services occurred 
also contributing to the increase were increased revenues for the company s latin american operations  primarily due to increased revenues from existing clients and new business generated as the company continued to expand in this area 
cost of revenues cor 
cor consists principally of commissions paid or payable to the company s auditors based primarily upon the level of overpayment recoveries  and compensation paid to various types of hourly workers and salaried operational managers 
also included in cor are other direct costs incurred by these personnel  including rental of non headquarters offices  travel and entertainment  telephone  utilities  maintenance and supplies and clerical assistance 
a significant portion of the components comprising cor for the company s domestic accounts payable services operations are variable compensation related costs and will increase or decrease with increases and decreases in revenues 
the cor support base for domestic retail and domestic commercial operations are not separately distinguishable and are not evaluated by management individually 
the company s international accounts payable services also have a portion of their cor  although less than domestic accounts payable services  that will vary with revenues 
the lower variability is due to the predominant use of salaried auditor compensation plans in most emerging market countries 
accounts payable services cor for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions domestic accounts payable service cor international accounts payable services cor total accounts payable services cor the dollar decrease in cor for compared to for domestic accounts payable services was primarily due to lower revenues during and correspondingly lower costs that vary with revenues

the company believes that if revenues remain at lower than historical levels  cor as a percentage of revenues for the company s accounts payable services operations will remain at higher levels than in prior periods 
for the year ended december   on a dollar basis  domestic accounts payable services cor increased over the prior year primarily due to increased expenses associated with increased year over year revenues 
on a percentage basis  cor as a percentage of revenues from domestic accounts payable services for the year ended december  was of domestic accounts payable services revenues  comparable to for the same period of on a dollar basis  cor for the company s international accounts payable services increased over the same period of the prior year primarily due to increases attributable to currency fluctuations in the countries in which the company operates  combined with local currency increases in cor associated with airline ticket revenue recovery audit services currently provided to one large client  and to a lesser degree  local currency increases in cor for the company s asian operations 
partially offsetting these increases were local currency decreases in cor experienced by the company s latin american operations 
the increase in cor for international accounts payable services with airline ticket revenue recovery audit services currently provided to one large client directly related to increased revenues derived from this client  as discussed above  when compared to the same period of the prior year 
the improvement in cor for the company s latin american operations was primarily due to a reduction in personnel and a change in the commission structure for some of the auditors in the latin american operations 
internationally  cor as a percentage of revenues for international accounts payable services for the year ended december  was  up from in the comparable period of the increase in cor as a percentage of revenues for international accounts payable services for the year ended december   as compared with the same period of the prior year  was predominately due to the company s european operations 
as a result of decreased revenues  the company s european operations experienced a decrease in the variable cost component of cor 
however  the european operations continue to incur certain fixed costs that are a component of cor 
as revenues decrease  these fixed costs constitute a larger percentage of cor and result in a higher overall cor as a percentage of revenues 
although the company believes that its european revenues will grow in over levels achieved in  if those revenues were to remain at lower than historical levels  cor as a percentage of revenues for the company s international accounts payable services operations will remain at a higher level than in prior periods 
internationally  cor as a percentage of revenues for international accounts payable services for the year ended december  was  up from in the comparable period of the year over year increase in the cor  on a dollar basis and as a percentage of revenues for international accounts payable services was driven primarily by the company s european operations 
the overall cost structure of the european operations was significantly impacted by the acquisitions of the businesses of hsa texas and affiliates 
for the better part of the year ended december   the majority of the european auditors acquired through the acquisitions retained their independent contractor status 
as independent contractors  their compensation structure was higher than the compensation structure of the company s employee associates 
as of december   the company was successful in transitioning a majority of the european independent contractors to employees 
however  the uk auditors acquired through the acquisitions are currently anticipated to retain their independent contractor status for the foreseeable future 
the year over year increase in cor  on a dollar basis and as a percentage of revenues in international accounts payable services operations was also impacted to a lesser degree by cor related to the company s pacific operations 

table of contents the pacific operations experienced an increase in cor as a percentage of revenues and on a dollar basis  primarily due to increased payroll expense as additional auditors were hired during to support the increase in new clients 
new auditors are hired at a fixed compensation rate resulting in higher cor as a percentage of revenues during the ramp up period  which can be six to nine months 
after the ramp up period  these auditors are usually transitioned to a variable based compensation structure

as a result of meridian s revenue recognition policies  its revenues can vary markedly from period to period 
revenue generated by meridian increased for the year ended december  over the comparable period of primarily due to higher refunds received from certain european vat authorities for claims that had been outstanding for an extended period of time

kg dkv are each a owner of a joint venture named transporters vat reclaim limited tvr 
in april  tvr entered into a financing facility with barclays bank plc barclays  whereby it sells the vat refund claims to barclays with full recourse 
as a condition of the financing facility between tvr and barclays  meridian has provided an indemnity to barclays for any losses that barclays may suffer in the event that meridian processes any fraudulent claims on tvr s behalf 
meridian has not been required to remit funds to barclays under this indemnity and the company believes the 
table of contents probability of the indemnity clause being invoked is remote 
meridian has no obligation to barclays as to the collectibility of vat refund claims sold by tvr to barclays unless fraudulent conduct is involved 
in july  meridian entered into a deposit guarantee the guarantee with credit commercial de france ccf in the amount of million euro million at december  exchange rates 
the guarantee serves as assurance to vat authorities in france that meridian will properly and expeditiously remit all french vat refunds it receives in its capacity as intermediary and custodian to the appropriate client recipients

during the period of may through september  meridian has received grants from the industrial development authority of ireland ida in the sum of million euro million at december  exchange rates 
the grants were paid primarily to stimulate the creation of permanent jobs in ireland 
as a condition of the grants  if the number of permanently employed meridian staff in ireland falls below  the grants are repayable in full 
this contingency expires on september  meridian currently employs permanent employees in dublin  ireland 
the european union has currently proposed legislation that will remove the need for suppliers to charge vat on the supply of services to clients within the european union 
the effective date of the proposed legislation is currently unknown 
management estimates that the proposed legislation  if enacted as currently drafted  would have a material adverse impact on meridian s results of operations 
if meridian s results of operations were to decline as a result of the proposed legislation  it is possible that the number of permanent employees that meridian employs in ireland could fall below prior to september if the number of permanent employees that meridian employs in ireland falls below prior to september  the full amount of the grants previously received will need to be repaid to ida 
as any potential liability related to these grants is not currently determinable  the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  included in item of this form k does not include any expense related to this matter 
management is monitoring this situation and if it appears probable meridian s permanent staff in ireland will fall below and that grants will need to be repaid to the ida  the company will recognize an expense at that time 
the company s current intention is to redirect most of meridian s employees who would be made redundant by the proposed legislation to provide services to its core accounts payable services business 
the company believes that this redirection will significantly enhance its accounts payable services business internationally as well as provide the peripheral benefit of mitigating the risk of a future ida grant repayment 
the company has adopted a strategic plan to revitalize the business and respond to the changing competitive environment 
the strategic plan focuses on a series of initiatives designed to maintain the company s dedicated focus on its clients and to rekindle the company s growth 
specifically  the company plans to focus on the core accounts payable services business  evolve the service model  grow the domestic accounts payable services business  grow the international accounts payable services business  develop new business  and maintain high client retention rates 
the company has begun implementation of the strategy but remains in the relatively early stages of that process 
each of the initiatives requires sustained management focus  organization and coordination over time  as well as success in building relationships with third parties 
the results of the strategy and implementation will not be known until some time in the future 
if the company is unable to implement the strategy successfully  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
successful implementation of the strategy may require material increases in costs and expenses 
the company anticipates making capital expenditures in the range of million to million during  including approximately million to million of capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred related to the company s model evolution efforts under its strategic plan 
the company believes that its working capital  current availability under its senior bank credit facility  as amended  which matures on december   and cash flows generated from future operations will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements through december  unless it is required to make unanticipated accelerated debt repayments due to future unanticipated 
table of contents violations of the credit agreement  as amended  that are not waived by the banking syndicate 
if a future credit ratio covenant violation under the credit agreement does occur  and if the banking syndicate declares the then outstanding principal to be immediately due and payable  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure additional financing that will be required to make such a rapid repayment 
additionally  if such a banking syndicate accelerated repayment demand is subsequently made and the company is unable to honor it  cross default language contained in the indenture underlying the company s separately outstanding million convertible notes issue  due november   could also be triggered  potentially accelerating the required repayment of those notes as well 
in such an instance  there can likewise be no assurance that the company will be able to secure additional financing that would be required to make such a rapid repayment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency market risk 
our functional currency is the us dollar although we transact business in various foreign locations and currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we provide services 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we operate 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  the value of nonfunctional currency revenues decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the functional currency amount of revenues increases 
overall  we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefit from a weaker dollar 
we are therefore adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
interest rate risk 
our interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our debt 
at december   we had fixed rate convertible notes outstanding with a principal amount of million which bear interest at per annum 
at december   we had approximately million of short term variable rate debt outstanding 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates on variable rate debt during the twelve months ended december  would have resulted in approximately a million change in pre tax income 
derivative instruments 
as a multi national company  the company faces risks related to foreign currency fluctuations on its foreign denominated cash flows  net earnings  new investments and large foreign currency denominated transactions 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risks 
the use of financial instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce the risk to the company 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes  nor does it use leveraged financial instruments 
the company did not have any derivative financial instruments outstanding as of december  see note f of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k
