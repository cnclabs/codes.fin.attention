item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s revenues consist of staffing services and professional employer organization peo service fees 
staffing services revenues are derived from services performed for short term staffing  contract staffing and on site management 
peo service fees refer exclusively to co employer contractual agreements with peo clients 
the company s revenues from staffing services represent all amounts invoiced to customers for direct payroll  employer payroll related taxes  workers compensation coverage and a service fee equivalent to a mark up percentage 
peo service fee revenues are recognized in accordance with eitf  reporting revenues gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
as such  the company s peo service fee revenues include amounts invoiced to peo customers for employer payroll related taxes  workers compensation coverage and a gross profit 
thus  amounts invoiced to peo customers for salaries  wages  health insurance and employee out of pocket expenses incurred incidental to employment are excluded from peo service fee revenues and cost of revenues 
the company s oregon and california offices accounted for approximately of its total net revenues in consequently  weakness in economic conditions in these regions could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
safety incentives represent cash incentives paid to certain peo client companies for maintaining safe work practices in order to minimize workplace injuries 
the incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined workers compensation claims cost objectives 
the safety incentive expense is netted against peo revenues on the company s statements of operations 
the company s cost of revenues is comprised of direct payroll costs for staffing services  employer payroll related taxes and employee benefits and workers compensation 
direct payroll costs represent the gross payroll earned by staffing services employees based on salary or hourly wages 
payroll taxes and employee benefits consist of the employer s portion of social security and medicare taxes  federal unemployment taxes  state unemployment taxes and staffing services employee reimbursements for materials  supplies and other expenses  which are paid by the customer 
workers compensation expense consists primarily of the costs associated with the company s self insured workers compensation program  such as claims reserves  claims administration fees  legal fees  state and federal administrative agency fees and reinsurance costs for catastrophic injuries 
the company also maintains separate workers compensation insurance policies for employees working in states where the company is not self insured 
the largest portion of workers compensation expense is the cost of workplace injury claims 
when an injury occurs and is reported to the company  the company s respective independent third party claims administrator tpa analyzes the details of the injury and develops a case reserve  which is the tpa s estimate of the cost of the claim based on similar injuries and its professional judgment 
the company then records  or accrues  an expense and a corresponding liability based upon the tpa s estimates for claims reserves 
as cash payments are made by the company s tpa against specific case reserves  the accrued liability is reduced by the corresponding payment amount 
the tpa also reviews existing injury claims on an on going basis and adjusts the case reserves as new or additional information for each claim becomes available 
the company has established additional reserves to provide for future unanticipated increases in expenses adverse loss development of the claims reserves for open injury claims and for claims incurred but not reported related to prior and current periods 
management believes that the company s operational policies and internal claims reporting system help to limit the occurrence of unreported incurred claims 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses represent both branch office and corporate level operating expenses 
branch operating expenses consist primarily of branch office staff payroll and personnel related costs  advertising  rent  office supplies  depreciation and branch incentive compensation 
corporate level operating expenses consist primarily of executive and office staff payroll and personnel related costs  professional and legal fees  travel  depreciation  occupancy costs  information systems costs and executive and corporate staff incentive bonuses 
amortization of intangible assets consists of the amortization of software costs  and covenants not to compete  which are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from two to years 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the following policies as critical to the company s business and the understanding of its results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
note that the preparation of this annual report on form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
self insured workers compensation reserves 
the company is self insured for workers compensation coverage in a majority of its employee work sites 
accruals for workers compensation expense are made based upon the company s claims experience and an annual independent actuarial analysis  utilizing company experience  as well as claim cost development trends and current workers compensation industry loss information 
as such  a majority of the company s recorded expense for workers compensation is management s best estimate 
management believes that the amount accrued is adequate to cover all known and unreported claims at december  however  if the actual costs of such claims and related expenses exceed the amount estimated  additional reserves may be required  which could have a material negative effect on operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company must make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivables 
management analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in the customers payment tendencies when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
intangible assets and goodwill 
the company assesses the recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value might be impaired 
factors that are considered include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry trends and significant change in the manner of use of the acquired assets 
management s current assessment of the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill indicates there is no impairment based upon projected future cash flows 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets

the gross revenues and cost of revenues information below  although not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  is presented for comparison purposes and because management believes such information is more informative as to the level of the company s business activity and more useful in managing its operations

basic income per share for was

as compared to basic and diluted loss per share of 
for revenues for totaled  an increase of approximately  or over revenues of  the increase in total revenues was due primarily to the significant growth in the company s professional employer peo service fee revenue in california  partially offset by a small decline in staffing service revenue 
peo service fee revenue increased  or  while staffing services revenue decreased  or  which resulted in an increase in the share of peo service fee revenue to of total revenues for  as compared to for the increase in peo service fee revenue for was primarily due to strong growth in california attributable to business opportunities available to the company as a qualified self insured employer for workers compensation coverage resulting from the adverse market conditions for workers compensation insurance in the state 
management expects growth in demand for its peo services to continue in the foreseeable future 
the decrease in staffing services revenue for was primarily attributable to continued weak demand for the company s services in the majority of areas in which the company does business owing to general weak economic conditions 
the share of staffing services revenues had a corresponding decrease from of total revenues for to for gross margin for totaled  which represented an increase of  or over the gross margin percent increased from of revenues for to for the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to lower direct payroll costs and workers compensation costs  offset in part by higher payroll taxes and benefit costs  as a percentage of net revenues 
the decrease in direct payroll costs as a percentage of net revenues from for to for primarily reflects the current mix of services to the current customer base and to the effect of their unique mark up percent 
the decrease in workers compensation costs  as a percentage of net revenues  from of revenues for to for  was principally due to a lessening of the increase in the adverse development of estimated future costs of workers compensation claims primarily concentrated in the company s california operations 
the increase in payroll taxes and benefits as a percentage of net revenues from for to for was primarily attributable to higher state unemployment tax rates in various states in which the company operates  as well as to the effect of significant growth in peo services 
the company expects gross margin  as a percentage of net revenues  to continue to be influenced by fluctuations in the mix between staffing and peo services  including the mix within the staffing segment  as well as the adequacy of its estimates for workers compensation liabilities  which may be negatively affected by unanticipated adverse loss development of claims reserves 
in connection with the company s self insured workers compensation program  the company has maintained an excess workers compensation policy which limits the financial effect of costly workers compensation claims 
for the calendar year  such policies included a self insured retention or deductible of  per occurrence 
effective january   the self insured retention or deductible increased to  per occurrence 
effective january   the self insured retention or deductible on the company s excess workers compensation policy increased to  per occurrence  although the premium cost per of payroll declined significantly 
management believes that the company obtained the most favorable terms and conditions available in the market  in view of the effect of the events of september   on the insurance industry and the company s size and scope of operations 
sg a expenses consist of compensation and other expenses incident to the operation of the company s headquarters and the branch offices and the marketing of its services 
sg a expenses for amounted to  an increase of  or over sg a expenses  expressed as a percentage of net revenues  declined from for to for the increase in total sg a dollars was primarily due to increases in branch management personnel and related expenses as a result of the growth in the company s peo business 
depreciation and amortization totaled  for  which compares to  for the depreciation and amortization expense level remained comparable to amounts due to the company s current low level of capital expenditures 
at december   the company had net deferred income tax assets of  primarily reflecting temporary differences between taxable income for financial accounting and tax purposes and tax credit carryforwards  which will reduce taxable income in future years 
pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles  the company is required to assess the realization of the deferred income tax assets as significant changes in circumstances may require adjustments during future periods 
although realization is not assured  management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred income tax assets will be realized  principally based upon projected taxable income for the next two years 
the amount of the net deferred income tax assets actually realized could vary  if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred income tax assets or changes in the actual amounts of future taxable income as compared to operating forecasts 
if the company s operating forecast is determined to no longer be reliable due to uncertain market conditions  the company s long term forecast may require reassessment 
as a result  in the future  a valuation allowance may be required to be established for all or a portion of the net deferred income tax assets 
such a valuation allowance could have a significant effect on the company s future results of operations and financial position 
effective january   the company acquired certain assets of skills resource training center srtc  a staffing services company with nine offices in central washington  eastern oregon and southern idaho 
the company paid  in cash for the assets of srtc and the selling shareholders noncompete agreements and agreed to issue up to  shares of its common stock earnout shares  with the actual number of earnout shares to be issued based upon the level of financial performance achieved by the srtc offices during calendar the company offers various qualified employee benefit plans to its employees  including its peo employees 
these qualified employee benefit plans include a savings plan the k plan under section k of the internal revenue code the code  a cafeteria plan under section of the code  a group health plan  a group life insurance plan and group disability insurance plan 
generally  qualified employee benefit plans are subject to provisions of both the code and the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
in order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the code  qualified plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees 
after several years of study  on april   the internal revenue service irs issued revenue procedure rev proc to provide relief with respect to certain defined contribution retirement plans maintained by a peo that benefit worksite employees 
the rev proc outlines the steps necessary for a peo to avoid plan disqualification for violating the exclusive benefit rule 
essentially  a peo must either terminate the plan  convert its plan to a multiple employer plan by december   or transfer the plan assets and liabilities to a customer plan 
effective december   the company converted its k plan to a multiple employer plan

fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company has historically experienced significant fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and expects such fluctuations to continue in the future

the company s revenue levels fluctuate from quarter to quarter primarily due to the impact of seasonality on its staffing services business and on certain of its peo clients in the agriculture and forest products related industries

payroll taxes and benefits fluctuate with the level of direct payroll costs  but tend to represent a smaller percentage of revenues and direct payroll later in the company s fiscal year as federal and state statutory wage limits for unemployment and social security taxes are exceeded by some employees
