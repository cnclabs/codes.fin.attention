on this web site  the public can access our annual  quarterly and current reports free of charge through a hyperlink to the securities and exchange commission website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with  or furnish such material to  the securities and exchange commission 
sipex intends to satisfy the disclosure requirements under item of form k regarding amendment to  or waiver from  our code of ethics by posting such information on our website at www 
sipex 
com  provided such method of disclosure is then in compliance with the rules of the nasdaq national market and the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
company overview sipex was incorporated in may under the laws of the state of massachusetts 
effective october  we changed our state of incorporation from massachusetts to delaware 
sipex designs  manufactures and markets  high performance  analog integrated circuits ics that are used primarily by original equipment manufacturers  or oems  operating in the computing  consumer electronics  communications and networking infrastructure markets 
some of the end product applications that contain our ics are cellular phones  base stations  computers  dvd players  and digital cameras 
while advances in digital technology have fueled the demand for digital integrated circuits  they have also created a demand for more precise  faster and more power efficient analog ics 
we possess a broad portfolio of analog ics  organized into three product families power management  serial interface and optical storage 
our wafer fabrication facility in milpitas  california along with a number of third party contractors fabricate  package and test our ics 
our products are sold either directly or through a global network of manufacturers representatives and distributors 
semiconductor industry background integrated circuits  the essential building blocks of today s electronic products  are classified as either digital or analog ics 
digital ics eg memory products  microprocessors and digital signal processors  or 
table of contents dsps  process binary signals composed of strings of s and s 
often they are constrained by market based standards and depend on a company s ability to design and manufacture very large scale circuits  using expensive  state of the art process technologies that minimize device size 
analog ics act as the bridge between the digital world and physical world 
they transform signals derived from the physical environment  such as heat  pressure  sound and light  or monitor and condition analog signals derived from external electronic inputs 
by contrast with digital ics  analog ics are most often designed and optimized for specialized applications in niche markets 
their development and successful market adoption require close customer contact and the deployment of small  tightly coordinated teams of experienced and highly skilled engineers who understand the complexities of the ic and understand the interrelationships with its layout  process technology  packaging and end application 
analog and digital ic manufacturers often share the characteristics of the semiconductor industry including cyclical market demands  capacity limitations  oversupply conditions  manufacturing variation  accelerated product life cycles  price erosion  global competition  requirement for capital equipment expenditures and rapid technology changes 
product life cycles in the analog ic market  with some exceptions  tend to be longer and customer pricing less volatile because competition  particularly foreign competition  is more limited and customers avoid major changes in the analog portions of their products due to the design complexities involved and the volume of the product used in a typical application 
the capital expenditures for analog ic manufacturers are typically lower because analog ics usually consume less silicon area and their fabrication processes are focused on device matching and careful layout and do not require frequent and expensive equipment upgrades or replacements to remain competitive 
sipex s business strategy we supply our customers in target markets with an array of standard product choices as well as custom products  which compete on the basis of features  performance and competitive pricing 
sipex maintains close working relationships with strategic customers 
we believe that our relationships enable us to create and follow future directed product and technology roadmaps  and shorten our customers product development cycles 
in addition  we have restructured our operations during and to reduce costs and improve quality 
sipex markets  applications and products we sell products into a variety of applications and markets including networking and communications  computer and peripherals  industrial controls and instrumentation  and consumer products 
the customer end products in these markets are driven basically by the same requirements higher operating efficiency  higher accuracy  more power at lower voltages  faster data transfer and higher bandwidth 
these requirements provide opportunities for sipex to develop power management  serial interface and optical storage ics with features designed for applications  ranging from power modules in routers to pick up heads in cd dvd systems 
we currently support approximately one thousand ics in three product categories 
these products  whether custom or proprietary  are designed for specific end applications that require unique feature sets  specific electrical performance criteria speed  precision  power  etc  and or additional system level integration 
we focus on developing these products as standard analog ics in order to serve larger markets and reduce the risk of dependency on single customer requirements 
power management products these ics regulate  control  monitor or provide the reference voltage for a system or portion of a system 
dc dc regulators and pulse width modulation pulse frequency modulation controllers convert voltage up or down within a system and provide a controlled level of power to the system  independent of normal operating load  line and temperature fluctuations 
supervisory ics monitor power levels and notify controller ics of out of range power conditions 
voltage references establish benchmark voltages within a system and provide constant outputs independent of temperature and other operating variations 
within this product category  sipex develops white light emitting diode led drivers needed in virtually every consumer portable device 
this product family is replacing the electroluminescent lamp driver family  
table of contents which developed high voltage alternating current ac signals from low voltage battery sources that provides backlighting for liquid crystal displays lcds 
the power management product portfolio continued to expand in with proprietary ics including white led drivers  dc dc regulators and controllers 
these new products deliver improved power efficiency  increased miniaturization and more power at lower voltage levels to portable power and distributed power applications 
interface products interface products facilitate the transfer of digital signals between or within electronic systems and ensure reliable connectivity between networks  computers and the rapidly expanding mix of digital peripherals and consumer portable devices that connect to them 
the single protocol rs and rs transceivers comply with international standards in delivering multi channel digital signals between two systems 
the multi protocol transceivers enable network equipment to communicate with a large population of peripherals that use a diverse set of serial protocol standards without the added burden of multiple add on boards and cables 
the focus on lower voltage to conserve energy has made our low voltage  serial interface ics popular in a variety of digital peripherals including data cables for pdas  cellular phones and digital cameras 
multi protocol ics continue to be used in networking and telecommunications equipment 
optical storage products the optical storage product family  a recent addition to the sipex product portfolio  started shipping in volume during the second quarter of this product family provides complete electronic solutions for pick up heads used in optical storage systems  such as cd and dvd devices 
optical storage products tend to have shorter design cycles  time to volume and product lives than interface and power management products 
optical storage products consist of photo detector ics  advanced power control ics and laser diode drivers 
the photo detector ics capture a portion of the light reflected from the optical storage medium  convert it to a set of electronic digital signals and forward them to the chipset for processing 
the reflected light contains both data and tracking information 
the advanced power control ics capture a portion of the optical power coming from the laser and feed it back into a control system that regulates laser intensity 
this control function is used to prevent damage to the laser diode and extend the life of the system 
for both of these functions  we have developed technology that permits the photo detection functions to be incorporated with their signal conditioning circuitry 
this functional integration enables faster read speeds and smaller footprints in dvd r w  dvd ram and cd r w systems 
sipex has developed a family of laser diode drivers that control the laser diode in the pick up head 
our devices are designed to drive two lasers at high speed 
this will allow the customer to build a nm and nm system on one pick up head for combo cd dvd devices 
we introduced our first product in this product family during sales  distribution and marketing sipex sells its products to oem customers primarily through our distributor network  as well as through a direct sales force and a network of independent sales representatives 
the direct sales force consists of regional sales managers and field applications engineers who support our sales representatives  distributors and customers with technical support services 
our sales staff and field application engineers also manage  train and support our network of distributors and representatives 
the sales and field applications staff are located in our billerica  massachusetts and milpitas  california facilities and in field offices in china  france  germany  japan  korea  taiwan and the united kingdom see note for segment export sales and major customers 
most of our sales are generated through the worldwide distributor network 
most of our design win activity is generated through our wide network of independent representatives and through our direct sales force 
design wins are decisions by customers to include our products as a component of the designs for their own future products

our marketing team develops long term product and technology roadmaps based on first hand market knowledge  close customer relationships  industry experience  and a variety of public and private market data 
detailed technical information in the form of data sheets  application notes and tutorials is posted on our website and a variety of technical and sales materials are published and distributed to customers  sales representative and distributors 
sipex engages in print advertising to raise market awareness of our products and services 
customers our customer base is comprised of industrial distributors  original equipment manufacturers oems  original design manufacturers odms  and electronic manufacturing services companies ems 
industrial distributors provide logistical and supply chain services to their customers 
the oems and odms use our products as components in their equipment and systems 
in certain cases  we sell our products to ems companies who buy our products and use them in the systems and subsystems they manufacture for oems and odms 
the end users of our products include cisco systems  dell computer  hewlett packard  ibm  nortel networks  siemens ag and toshiba 
see also our disclosure regarding future  our exclusive distributor for north america and europe under sales  distribution and marketing above 

table of contents backlog our product backlog was approximately million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in sipex s backlog as of december  was primarily due to the phase out of legacy products  such as hybrid and electroluminescent display driver el 
we generally include in backlog all orders scheduled for delivery within one year 
however  our business  and to a large extent the entire semiconductor industry  is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules 
sipex generally permits orders to be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to customers 
as a result  the quantities of our products to be delivered and their delivery schedules may be revised by customers to reflect changes in their needs 
since backlog can be canceled or rescheduled  our backlog at any time is not necessarily indicative of future revenues 
in addition  due to the high percentage of our sales going through the distributors channel  our backlog may be affected by inventory levels at our distributors 
manufacturing sipex has a wafer fabrication facility in milpitas  california which supplies most of our product needs except for the optical storage products and certain power products requiring more advanced process technologies 
this wafer fabrication facility commenced manufacturing operations in the second half of  and was used to produce both four inch and six inch diameter wafers 
the lease for the four inch wafer facility  located in san jose  california  was assumed by an unrelated third party in early as a part of sipex s restructuring initiative 
at the end of december of  we ceased all test operations in billerica  massachusetts and transferred those operations to the subcontractors in asia 
our manufacturing capabilities are broadened by using third party foundries to produce complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos processed wafers and bicmos processed wafers 
the use of third party foundries enables us to minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures while providing access to diverse manufacturing technologies without bearing the full risk of obsolescence 
all of these foundries have been certified as iso compliant 
production by third party foundries represented approximately   and of sipex shipments in  and  respectively 
in  we entered into an exclusive sourcing arrangement with polarfab on certain products in return for favorable pricing  delivery and engineering support 
we did not experience parts shortage conditions in sipex tests integrated circuits or die on the wafers produced internally and by its foundries for compliance with performance specifications before assembly 
our commercial products are assembled and tested by a variety of subcontractors in asia which have been certified as iso  tl compliant 
following testing  the packaged units are shipped directly from our subcontractors to our customers worldwide 
product quality assurance and reliability sipex is committed to customer satisfaction and continuous improvement in all aspects of its business 
this is accomplished through a comprehensive quality and reliability system founded on documented procedures 
quality tools such as statistical process control  cross functional teaming and advanced statistical analysis are used in qualification  production processes and quality improvement activities 
we maintain close relationships with our subcontractors and routinely qualify suppliers to established standards 
sipex is iso certified and has continuously maintained its iso certification since patents  licenses and trademarks we seek to protect our proprietary technology through patents and trade secret protection 
currently  we hold a number of patents expiring between now and and have additional united states patent applications pending  although there can be no assurance that any patents will result from these applications 
while we intend to continue to seek patent coverage for our products and manufacturing technology where appropriate  we believe that our success depends more heavily on the technical expertise and innovative abilities of our personnel than on our patent position 
accordingly  we also rely on trade secrets and confidential technological know how in the conduct of our business 
there can be no assurance that our 
table of contents patents or applicable trade secret laws will provide adequate protection for our technology against competitors who may develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products 
in addition  the laws of certain territories in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including asia  europe and latin america  may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states of america 
pursuant to license agreements  sipex pays a royalty to maxim integrated products and analog devices for certain interface product sales 
we also paid a royalty to timex corporation for certain electroluminescent product sales through september when the contract ended 
in addition  during we paid lemelson medical  education and research foundation and syndia corporation for certain cmos and bicmos processes 
research and development sipex believes that continued introduction of new products in target markets is essential to growth 
as performance demands and complexity of analog circuits have increased  the design and development process has become a multi disciplinary effort  requiring diverse competencies to achieve customers desired performance 
in addition to our staff of design engineers  we have an infrastructure of product and test engineers who perform various support functions 
we spent approximately million in and million in and on research and development  representing  and of net sales for these periods  respectively 
we expect to focus more on the productivity of our research and development investment through better product definition  consistent strategy and improved tools 
overall expenditures in support of research and development activity are likely to increase slightly in absolute dollars in the near future 
our ability to compete depends in part upon continued introduction of technologically innovative products on a timely basis 
research and development efforts are directed primarily at designing and introducing new products and technologies 
we seek to continually upgrade our internal technology while also working with foundries to develop new technologies for new generations of products 
in addition  we seek to continually refine our manufacturing practices and technology to improve product yields 
competition we compete in multiple segments of the analog integrated circuit market 
this market is intensely competitive and many major semiconductor companies presently compete or could compete with sipex in the same applications or products 
sipex s current primary competitors include analog devices  intersil  linear technology  maxim integrated products  micrel semiconductor  national semiconductor  on semiconductor  pioneer  semtech  sharp  sony and texas instruments among others 
our primary competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  distribution  other resources and broader product lines than we do 
in addition  there are foreign semiconductor makers that compete primarily on a price basis 
although foreign companies  active in the semiconductor market  have not traditionally focused on the high performance analog market  with the exception of the optical marketplace  many foreign companies have the financial and other resources to participate successfully in these markets and may become formidable competitors in the future 
we believe that product innovation  quality  reliability  performance and the ability to introduce products rapidly are important competitive factors in our target markets  because we compete primarily during the customer s design in stage of product development 
we further believe that cost competitiveness is paramount in every segment of the semiconductor industry 
employees at december   we had full time employees  as compared with employees in the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  as part of our restructuring initiative  we 
table of contents outsourced back end test operations to asia  reducing headcount by staff 
this reduction in headcount was partially offset by hiring in engineering and other critical functions 
during the later part of  we implemented a restructuring program that included discontinuing the billerica  massachusetts manufacturing activities  discontinuing the four inch wafer fabrication in san jose  california  the reorganization of the company into functional groups and the full conversion to six inch wafer fabrication facility in milpitas  california 
these actions in resulted in a significant reduction of the company s headcount compared to our headcount at the end of which was employees 
we believe that our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical and manufacturing personnel 
this is particularly important in the areas of product design and development  where competition for skilled personnel is intense 
none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage

sipex may become involved in various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business  including securities class actions and other actions 
in february  sipex filed a lawsuit against maxim integrated products  inc maxim with the us district court for the district of massachusetts seeking a declaratory judgment that three of sipex s products did not infringe maxim patents 
maxim filed counterclaims alleging certain products sold by sipex infringe a maxim patent 
the counterclaims sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages 
during the second quarter of  a settlement was reached whereby maxim granted sipex a license covering auto online functionality used in some serial interface products 
in addition  both companies dismissed all pending legal claims in all jurisdictions

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap  we are presenting non gaap measures of net sales  which are adjusted from results based on gaap  to present net sales before considering the impact of the million non cash charge related to the fair value of debt conversion rights to a related party  which is described below 
this non gaap adjustment is provided to enhance the overall understanding of our net sales compared to the gaap results of the prior year periods 
specifically  we believe that the non gaap results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding this non cash charge that we believe is not indicative of our core operating performance 
when such comparisons are made below  the inclusion or exclusion of the charge is clearly disclosed 
the presentation of this additional information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and is not necessarily comparable to non gaap results published by other companies 
overview we design  manufacture and market  high performance  analog integrated circuits  or ics  that are used primarily by original equipment manufacturers  or oems  operating in the computing  consumer  communications and networking infrastructure markets 
some of the end product applications that contain our ics are cellular phones  base stations  computers  dvd players  and digital cameras 
our products fall into three major product families power management  interface  and optical storage 
economic conditions in the analog semiconductor industry began to improve in following a prolonged downturn during and capacity utilization for the nation s semiconductor makers reached in november  which was the first time it had exceeded since december for sipex  demand in the first half of continued to be soft  while in the second half of the year there were signs of increased end user demand 
as with other semiconductor manufacturers  we are affected by overall 
table of contents market demand trends  however  we believe during our sales performance was more dependent on execution of our internal initiatives than on overall market conditions 
we focus on several key areas to drive operating and financial performance  including product mix  new product introductions  capacity utilization  cost reductions and productivity 
all of these key areas are interrelated and important in achieving improved gross margin 
product mix between our three product families and the sale of new products within each of our product families can significantly impact overall gross margin 
power management product gross margins have a wide range depending on the mix of sales within this product family 
the very high volume commodity products sold into the asian market  such as power regulators  have generally lower margin 
by contrast  our advanced power management product offerings  such as white led drivers  are new products  and contribute higher margins 
interface products generally bring higher margins than power management products  because they are manufactured in our internal fab 
optical storage product gross margins are generally above the company average  as all the products are new and proprietary 
capacity utilization of our wafer fab in milpitas  california is also an important factor in driving gross margin improvement 
a large portion of our fab cost structure is fixed  such as depreciation and payroll expenses for process engineering and manufacturing support  which can be leveraged over an increasing volume of completed wafers 
we build wafers for certain power management and all interface products in our fab 
we outsource all optical storage products 
cost reductions and productivity improvements are required in order to remain competitive in our marketplace 
cost reductions are achieved in several ways  such as re designing the products to shrink the size of the die  providing more individual products per wafer produced 
this generates increased output without adding significant incremental cost 
other cost reductions and productivity improvements come through product back end yield improvement and test time reduction 
during we continued the transformation of our product mix  eliminating legacy products  such as hybrid and el  while focusing on existing products and increasing the sale of new products introduced in our three core product families 
net sales attributed to legacy products decreased from million in to million in net sales of our three core product families increased from million in to million in excluding the impact of the million charge for the fair value of debt conversion rights  or 
new products introduced in optical storage enabled sales in this product family to grow compared to we also introduced several new products in the interface and power management product families 
our wafer fab operation in milpitas produced approximately of our wafer requirements 
in we produced more wafers than in  leveraging our fab cost structure  which contributed to our improved gross margin 
in addition  we reduced cost in the back end test operations by outsourcing more of the test operations to contract manufacturers in asia 
these cost reductions resulted from some of our restructuring initiatives in in the second half of  we converted certain of our high volume interface products to two micron geometry from five micron  thereby increasing the number of circuits per wafer  and increasing the end product sales value per wafer significantly with relatively minor increase in wafer cost 
as a result of the sales product mix transformation and the manufacturing improvements  our gross margin improved from an million loss in to a million loss in the gross loss of million in included a non cash charge of million reflecting the impact of the fair value of debt conversion rights with future  related party see note for related parties 
our net cash used from operations improved from a million net use of cash in to a million net use of cash in relationship with future future electronics inc future  is our exclusive distributor for north america and europe 
it is also our largest distributor worldwide  and accounted for  and of total net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  future increased its ownership of the company and became a related party 
we anticipate that sales of its products to future will continue to 
table of contents account for a significant portion of our revenues 
we have a distributor agreement that provides for future to act as our sole distributor for certain products within these territories 
sales to this distributor are made under an agreement that provides protection against price reduction for its inventory of our products 
we recognize revenue on sales to future under the distribution agreement when it sells the products through to the end customer 
on september   sipex sold a convertible secured note the first note with an attached warrant to an affiliate of future for an aggregate cash amount of million 
the private placement was convertible into million common shares at per share and included a warrant to purchase  shares of sipex common stock exercisable for a two year period beginning on the one year anniversary of the date of issuance 
the exercise price for the warrant is 
the first note was secured by a deed of trust on the company s land and building at milpitas  california 
in june  we received million in cash as part of a convertible note the second note financing from an affiliate of future 
in december  we entered into an agreement with the affiliates of future to amend certain terms of the first note and the second note 
the agreement  among other things  amended the second note to provide for full acceleration and vesting of the holder s conversion rights under the second note 
in addition  the agreement provided that  upon expiration or termination of the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended the hsr act  regulatory waiting period  the holder would convert the second note into million shares of our common stock at the original stated conversion price of per share 
in exchange for the full acceleration of the conversion rights under the second note  the holder paid us an additional million in cash  forgave  in currently accrued interest and agreed to eliminate our future interest obligations under the second note 
the agreement also provided that  upon the expiration or termination of the hsr act waiting period  the holder would convert the first note into million shares of our common stock at the original stated conversion price of per share 
in addition  the holder agreed to immediately eliminate our future interest obligations under the first note 
the agreement also provided that  upon obtaining the required hsr act clearance  the holders would cancel and otherwise release all security interests these entities may have on any of our assets 
in february  the us federal trade commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the hsr act and the holders converted the first note and the second note into an aggregate of million shares of our common stock 
in connection with the second note  we recorded a million non cash charge for the fair value of debt conversion rights  which were accelerated 
this charge will not recur in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those significant estimates that are particularly susceptible to change  which include 
table of contents revenue recognition  sales returns  inventory valuation  restructuring and impairment  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as the policies most critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonable assured 
future electronics inc future  a related party  is our exclusive distributor for north america and europe 
sales to this distributor are made under an agreement that provides protection against price reduction for future s inventory of our products 
in addition  future has stock rotation rights 
pursuant to these stock rotation rights  future is permitted on a quarterly basis to return for credit up to of its total purchases during the most recent three month period 
as the price of products sold to future is not fixed or determinable until resold by future to the end customer  we recognize revenue on sales to future when future sells the products through to the end customer 
accounts receivable are recognized and inventory is relieved upon shipment as title to inventories generally transfers upon shipment at which point the company has a legally enforceable right to collection under normal terms 
for all other sales  revenue is recognized upon title transfer and shipment because these distributors customers have no price protection and have limited return rights 
distributors are permitted to return products limited to a percentage of their purchases over a specified period of time 
we are able to estimate and establish appropriate reserves for future returns from these distributors 
for product sales recognized at the time of shipment  we accrue for estimated sales returns upon shipment based upon historical trends as well as any known pending sales returns 
we account for the fair value of the debt conversion rights of a convertible note payable to our related party distributor as a charge against net sales in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for a convertible instrument granted or issued to a nonemployee for goods or services or a combination of goods or services and cash 
however  this accounting treatment was discontinued on december  when sipex entered into an agreement with the affiliates of future to terminate the convertible debt pending termination of the waiting period under the hsr act 
during february  following early termination of the hsr act waiting period  the affiliates of future exercised the conversion rights to convert their notes into our common stock for million shares see note for related parties 
sales returns 
to estimate reserves for future sales returns  we regularly review our history of actual returns for each major product line 
we also communicate monthly with our channel partners to gather information about sell through activity  end user satisfaction and to determine the volume of inventory in the channel 
we use the results of this analysis to estimate the reserves for sales returns 
we adjust our reserves for future returns as necessary  based on returns experience  returns expectations and our communications with our channel partners 
in estimating reserves  we also consider unusual events and market conditions 
it is possible that future events such as the introduction of a competitive product  product obsolescence  price competition  weakness in the semiconductor industry and distributors desire to decrease levels of inventory in the distribution channel could result in significant changes in customer demand and cause future returns to increase beyond historical levels 
management believes that it is able to estimate returns  and establish appropriate reserves for returns from customers for which sipex recognizes revenue as of shipment  using the process described above 
however  since reserves for estimated sales returns are recorded as a reduction in revenues  any significant difference between our estimated and actual returns experience  or changes in our estimate of reserves for future returns  would be reflected in our reported revenues in the period we determine that difference  and 
table of contents could have a material impact on our future results of operations 
historically  our actual returns have been materially within our expectations 
inventory valuation 
we write down inventory for estimated excess quantities  obsolescence or unmarketability 
in addition  we write down inventory costs to the lower of cost or market 
excess and obsolete inventory is determined by comparing current inventory to current backlog  anticipated future demand and shipment history 
lower of cost or market adjustments are determined by reviewing shipments during the quarter as well as quarter beginning backlog and comparing standard cost to anticipated market pricing 
inventories are written down to the lower of cost or market which becomes the cost basis 
in estimating anticipated market pricing  we also consider current market conditions  industry performance  distributor inventory levels and sales to end users and all other relevant factors 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
reviews of the valuation of inventory are performed on a quarterly basis 
in  we recorded a million write down for excess and slow moving inventory 
also  inventory with an adjusted zero cost basis that was included in the million provision in was sold for million during restructuring and impairment 
the determination of the estimated restructuring accrual and impairment requires significant management judgment 
to estimate the restructuring accrual  we prepare a plan that includes the number of employees to be terminated and the related severance cost  the amount of impairment for certain fixed assets and inventory  the termination costs of certain leases and the related actions required to execute the plan 
it is possible that future events such as voluntary employee terminations  sublease agreements or a shift in the timing of the execution of the plan could result in significant changes to the original estimate 
restructuring costs recorded in were subsequently adjusted for a reduction of  in we accounted for restructuring charges beginning january  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
prior to january   we accounted for restructuring in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  restructuring and impairment charges 
during the fourth quarter of we established a million restructuring reserve for our facility in billerica  massachusetts 
this followed our restructuring initiative in which we transferred our back end test operations to asia in the first quarter of and began to integrate other support activities to milpitas  california 
by the fourth quarter of we had vacated and segregated approximately of the billerica  massachusetts facility and are seeking a lessee for this unoccupied space 
the restructuring reserve represents the present value of future lease payments subsequent to abandonment less any estimated sublease income net of associated costs 
to estimate future sublease income  we worked with an independent broker to estimate the length of time to sublease the facility and the total amount to be received 
however  our estimates of expected sublease income could change in the future based on factors that affect our ability to sublease this facility such as general economic conditions and the real estate market  among others 
we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if an impairment is indicated  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
in estimating future net cash flows  management makes certain assumptions including future sales levels  gross profit margins and expense levels and proceeds from disposition 
the future net cash flows can vary from management estimates due to unforeseen circumstances that may result in additional impairment charges required to be recognized in the income statement 

table of contents income taxes 
in assessing the net realizable value of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become taxable 
management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management assessed that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets at december  will be realized in the future 
we therefore established a full valuation allowance and incurred a tax charge for the full amount of deferred income tax asset of million for the year our deferred tax assets at december  continue to have a full valuation allowance 
results of operations for the periods indicated  the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by the respective line items in our consolidated statements of operations 
years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross loss operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative restructuring impairment of fixed assets amortization impairment of goodwill total operating expenses loss from operations other expense  net loss before income taxes fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales included a non cash charge of million reflecting the fair value of conversion rights related to the convertible note to future see note for related parties 
before considering the impact of this charge  net sales for the year were million  or a decrease compared to this decrease was attributable to our strategy to exit legacy product lines  hybrid and el for which net sales reduced by million  which was partially offset by a million increase in our core product families including interface  power management and optical storage 
the increases in compared to for all three product families were the following interface was million or  power management was  or  and optical storage was million or 
these increases were primarily due to several factors  including the introduction of several new products in all three families  cost reductions in interface and power management products allowing the company to compete in commodity pricing market conditions  and increased focus in managing the representative and distribution network to increase design wins for interface and power management products 
all of the increase in optical storage products was due to new products introduced in in the 
table of contents third quarter of  we sold the hybrid product family to satcon electronics inc  which resulted in no net sales for this product line in in addition  we discontinued producing the el product family by the first quarter of geographically  during international net sales were flat year over year  however domestic sales decreased million 
sales in japan grew by million or compared to the ramping of optical storage products in accounted for this increase as all our optics sales were generated in japan 
in asia other than in japan  net sales were slightly down as the mix shifted from legacy products to power management products 
net sales in europe and the rest of the world decreased million due to the discontinuance of the legacy product lines  partially offset by increases in both interface and power management products 
gross profit loss 
gross loss of million for the year ended december  included a non cash charge to sales reflecting the fair value of debt conversion rights of million see note for related parties 
the impact of this charge was to reduce gross profit from of net sales to a gross loss of 
compared to  gross loss decreased by million 
this improvement comprised the following product mix  manufacturing yield and process improvements of million  cost reductions related to restructuring initiatives of million  lower inventory write downs of million due to completion of our legacy product line exit initiative in  restructuring costs of million in  and million of revenue from the sale of the inventory in that was written off in these were partially offset by the million non cash charge for the fair value of debt conversion rights 
manufacturing yield and process improvements were the result of our continued effort primarily in standardized manufacturing processes and improved design for manufacturability 
during the second half of we converted a portion of our capacity to two micron geometry from five micron geometry that resulted in increasing the number of circuits per wafer  and increasing the end product sales value per wafer significantly with relatively minor increase in wafer cost 
this also contributed to our improved cost and yield performance 
in addition  we increased our wafer output while reducing direct labor hours in compared to research and development 
research and development expenses in were million compared to million in during we added several designers resulting in million of expense and obsoleted certain mask sets totaling million 
these increases were partially offset by reduced occupancy costs 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development costs were compared to in the prior year 
this was primarily due to the reduction in net sales  which resulted from a non cash charge reflecting the fair value of debt conversion rights see note for related parties 
we anticipate that research and development spending will increase in marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expenses of million in were lower compared to by million due to reduced occupancy costs  marketing communications and travel  partially offset by increased spending and headcount in our japan and taiwan sales offices and increased sales representative commissions due to increased sales in our core product families 
sales and marketing expenses were of net sales in compared to of net sales in this increase in percentage of net sales in was primarily due to the non cash charge for the fair value of debt conversion rights see note for related parties 
the increase was also attributable to the reduction in net sales before the non cash charge  partially offset by the reduced spending 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in or a reduction of million 
this decrease was largely due to lower severance costs of million and lower legal costs of million in compared to  partially offset by higher insurance costs  filing fees and other expenses 
restructuring and fixed asset impairment 
in we transferred our back end test operations to asia and completed the move of our headquarters and major operations to milpitas  california 
during   was reversed from the accrual for management reorganization charges and employee severance costs 
in december of  we established a restructuring reserve of million for our billerica  
table of contents massachusetts facility which includes a design center occupying approximately one fourth of the space 
we are seeking a lessee for the unused portion of the building 
accrued restructuring costs for the present value of future lease payments net of sublease income and associated costs as of december  for this facility included short term portion of  and long term portion of  respectively 
restructuring impairment costs costs inventory costs accrual balance incurred charges utilized adjustments to accrual accrual balance incurred charges utilized adjustments to accrual accrual balance other income expense  net 
other income expense  net was  in compared to  in the prior year 
the increase in expense was attributable to the interest expense associated with the two convertible notes with future see note for related parties 
during we incurred interest on the first note in the fourth quarter only 
during we incurred interest on the first note until december  and incurred interest on the second note from june  until december  as of december  all future interest expense had been forgiven 
both convertible notes were extinguished and converted into million of our common shares as of february  income tax expense 
income tax expense in was  based on the expected tax liability from our off shore operations  primarily belgium 
notwithstanding our net operating losses  we did not record a tax benefit as we believed that it was not more likely than not  considering the level of historical taxable income and expectations for future taxable income  that the operating loss would be utilized in the future to offset taxable income 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to the continued global slowdown in the semiconductor technology end markets resulting in lower average selling prices 
the decreases were primarily in the hybrid  analog display and legacy product families 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales in the power and optical storage product families 
net sales for were also unfavorably affected by million in the first quarter of  which was related to a change in the timing of revenue recognition on sales to our largest distributor 
effective october   we began to recognize revenue on sales to our largest distributor when the distributor sells our products to end users sell through  rather than upon shipment of the product to the distributor 
as of december   there was approximately million of inventory shipped to this distributor for which we had recognized revenue prior to october  accordingly  our net sales for the fiscal year ended were impacted by that amount 
our net sales were also impacted by million of sales in the fourth quarter to our largest distributor on a discounted  non cancelable and non returnable basis  which were recorded as revenue upon shipment 
international net sales  excluding canada  increased and domestic net sales decreased for the year ended december   as compared to international sales represented and of net sales for and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage of international sales in compared to was due to a decrease of million in domestic sales for  combined with a million increase in international sales 
geographically  sipex experienced sales growth of in asia other than japan and 
table of contents in japan  which was driven by our power and optical storage product families  while sales declined in europe and the rest of the world and in north america in gross profit loss 
gross loss was million or of net sales in  as compared to a gross loss of million or of net sales in the million deterioration resulted from the effect of decreased revenue due to lower average selling prices and increased inventory write offs  and was partially offset by lower manufacturing costs 
the gross loss in included million of inventory charges of which million was a fourth quarter cost adjustment and million was for excess and slow moving inventory  which included a million charge relating to product lines sold or discontinued as part of our third quarter restructuring plan and a  charge resulting from physical inventory adjustments 
of the million provision in  million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
the deterioration in gross margin was partially offset by improved yields in the second half of in  our wafer fabrication facility experienced lower capacity utilization and lower wafer fabrication yields 
in addition  we recorded provisions for slow moving and obsolete material of million  which included an inventory charge of million due to the sudden and significant decrease in forecasted revenue in our business experienced in the second quarter of research and development 
research and development expenses were million for both and  or and of net sales  respectively 
research and development expenses for included increased expenses for optical storage product startup costs in  offset by reduced process development expenses in the wafer fabrication facility 
the increase in research and development as a percentage of net sales in was primarily due to the decreased sales 
marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expenses were million and million for and  respectively  or and of net sales  respectively 
the absolute dollar decrease in marketing and selling expenses in  as compared to  was due to decreased sales representative commissions on lower net sales and the continued effect of cost savings measures implemented in the fourth quarter of the decrease as a percentage of net sales in was attributable to decreased sales representative commissions and continued cost savings measures  which were partially offset by the decrease in sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million and million in and  respectively  or and of net sales  respectively 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to severance costs of approximately  paid in the second quarter of to the company s former chief executive officer 
the increase as a percentage of net sales in was due to these costs and the decrease in sales 
amortization impairment of goodwill 
the company adopted sfas goodwill and other intangible assets effective january   thereby discontinuing annual goodwill amortization of approximately  upon adoption of sfas  the company performed a goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no indication of impairment and recorded no impairment charges as of january  in the second quarter of  the company experienced a significant reduction in the fair value of its common stock 
the fair value decrease was primarily related to the financial impact to sipex of the global slowdown in the semiconductor industry 
as a result  the company performed a goodwill impairment test in accordance with sfas the results of this impairment test indicated that the full amount of the company s goodwill of million was not recoverable and was written off 
during the company recorded goodwill amortization of 
table of contents the pro forma effects of the adoption of sfas on net loss and net loss per share for the company for the year ended december  are as follows in thousands net loss as reported goodwill amortization expense pro forma net loss basic net loss per share  as reported add back goodwill amortization expense pro forma basic net loss per share diluted net loss per share  as reported add back goodwill amortization expense pro forma diluted net loss per share restructuring  fixed asset impairment and inventory costs 
in september  sipex announced a plan to close the company s four inch wafer fabrication facility in san jose  california and change to a modified five day per week work schedule from the seven day per week schedule in the six inch wafer fabrication facility in milpitas  california 
these actions were taken to reduce the company s cost structure as a result of the slowdown in the semiconductor industry and to align the structure with our current business plan  which included the sale and discontinuance of the hybrid product line at the end of the third quarter and the discontinuance of the analog display product line which was completed toward the end of the first quarter of these product families accounted for approximately million of net sales in the third quarter of these actions allow us to consolidate our operations and focus on our three core product families consisting of interface  power management and optical storage 
below is a summary of the activity related to restructuring costs for fiscal years and in thousands restructuring impairment inventory costs costs costs accrual balance incurred charges utilized adjustments to accrual accrual balance incurred charges utilized adjustments to accrual accrual balance general during  we recorded restructuring charges of million  million of fixed asset impairment charges and million of inventory write downs 
gross restructuring charges consisted of employee severance costs of  management reorganization charges of approximately million and accrued lease expenses of  for the company s san jose  california facility 
these gross restructuring charges were reduced in the fourth quarter of for a  reversal in accrued lease costs for the company s san jose  california facility due to the assumption of the lease by a third party in the first quarter of and a  decrease in employee termination costs 
fixed asset impairment charges for consisted of million to write down the value of the machinery and equipment in the san jose  california facility to its 
table of contents fair value  as a result of the closure of the san jose fabrication facility in the first quarter of  and million of fabrication equipment at the milpitas  california  fabrication facility 
the million inventory write down  which was recorded in cost of sales  was established to properly value the discontinued analog display and hybrid product families 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a gain of  due to the sale of a portion of the inventory 
restructuring the third quarter restructuring charges for the above actions were million  which consisted of  of severance costs related to a reduction in force of approximately employees at both manufacturing facilities  million of severance and related costs to six former management employees related to the company s plan to reorganize into six functional groups and facility costs of  consisting mainly of the remaining lease payments at the san jose fabrication facility 
in the fourth quarter of  sipex incurred restructuring costs related to the transfer of the company s back end test operations from the billerica  massachusetts  facility to subcontractors in malaysia 
the restructuring costs consisted of  of employee severance related costs for the workforce reduction of approximately employees and freight charges of  related to the million sale of the billerica test related machinery and equipment with a net book value of million 
accrued severance costs as of december  were subsequently reduced by  which was originated from million of management reorganization charges and  of employee severance costs estimated in the remaining accrual was paid primarily during the first half of impairment third quarter fixed asset impairment charges totaled million  consisting of million of fabrication equipment on the company s four inch and six inch manufacturing product lines at the milpitas  california fabrication facility and million for the write down to fair value of the machinery and equipment at the san jose  california fabrication facility which had been scheduled to be closed by the end of the first quarter of in the first quarter of  the san jose  california fabrication machinery and equipment were sold to an unrelated third party 
the gain on the sale of the san jose  california fabrication machinery and equipment has been and will be recorded upon collection of the cash due to the length of time and related uncertainties affecting their ultimate receipt 
during sipex recorded net restructuring charges of  consisting of  for severance payments related to the reduction of our workforce  partially offset by a reduction of  in the restructuring accrual  which was established in the fourth quarter of the reduction in was due to the sale of the calogic fabrication facility  which had been planned for closure in as a result of the sale  we reduced both the facility exit related and employee termination portions of the accrual due to the assumptions of the facility by the new owners who retained many of the employees to whom we had planned to pay severance costs 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net was  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in other income in was due primarily to decreased interest income as a result of the decrease in restricted cash in the second quarter of the restricted cash was used to purchase the land  building and equipment of the milpitas  california wafer fabrication facility 
income tax expense 
we recorded an income tax charge of million for  as compared to an income tax benefit of million for in the second quarter of  the company established a full valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets  which included significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the valuation allowance was established  as the company no longer believed that it is more likely than not that the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards would be realized during the carryforward period 
this change in estimate during the second quarter of was based on updated evaluations considering historical taxable income levels and expectations of future taxable income 
for the year ended december   the company recorded an income tax benefit at a effective rate 
the company recorded the tax benefit for the period and the related increase in deferred tax assets  as it 
table of contents believed it was more likely than not  considering the level of historical taxable income and expectations for future taxable income  that the operating loss would be utilized in the future to offset taxable income 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had available funds of million consisting of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as compared to million at december  the increase of million was primarily due to million of capital which came through the private placement of million of convertible debt with an affiliate of future  a distributor for the company and related party  an additional million of proceeds from future for acceleration of debt conversion rights in december when an agreement was reached to terminate the two convertible notes with future see note for related parties and million for the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 
this was partially offset by a use of million in operating activities and million in capital expenditures 
in  available cash increased from million to million 
proceeds from a private placement of common stock and a private placement of a convertible note to future  a related party  contributed million and million  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities was million 
this was net of a million net loss  of which million was non cash related  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable  a million decrease in inventories and a million increase in accounts payable 
included in the million non cash charge were a million valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred income tax assets  million of depreciation  a provision of million for excess and obsolete inventory  a million charge for impairment of fixed assets  a million charge for goodwill impairment  and a provision of million for uncollectible receivables and returns and allowances 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities in resulted primarily from a million net loss  of which approximately million was non cash related  partially offset by a million net increase in working capital 
the million primarily comprised of a million non cash charge to sales for the fair value of debt conversion rights see note for related parties  depreciation of million   loss on disposal of capital assets and  net provision for restructuring 
the change in short term assets and liabilities included a million increase in deferred income associated with shipments to our largest distributor  where revenue is recognized on a sell through basis  increase in accounts payable of million and decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million 
we anticipate that cash used in operating activities will be further reduced through our efforts to improve our operating results 
the company will continue to depend upon its cash and cash equivalents to fund its operations until such time that the company generates cash from operating activities 
the increase of million in deferred income resulted from shipments to future  our largest distributor and related party  in anticipation of higher sell through activity 
during  we shipped million of product to future  and recognized million of sales through future 
accounts payable was million and million in december  and  respectively 
accounts receivable was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increases in accounts payable and accounts receivable are reflective of higher volume of manufacturing and shipping activity in december compared to the prior year 
reserves for accounts receivable decreased from  in to  in primarily due to a reduction in the sales returns reserve as the company experienced a reduction of products returned associated in part with the company s revised product line focus 
inventory grew to million as of december  from million as of due to a million increase in finished goods in anticipation of first quarter sales  partially offset by a reduction in raw materials 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in proceeds from maturity of short term investments were million compared to million of purchases of short term securities 
capital expenditures were million during  primarily consisting of million of wafer fabrication equipment and million of computer and other equipment 
during  net cash used in investing 
table of contents activities was million 
proceeds from maturity of short term investments were million compared to million of purchases of short term securities 
additions to property  plant and equipment were million  partially offset by million of proceeds from sale of test equipment to our subcontractors in asia as part of our outsourcing initiative 
the million capital spending in was primarily composed of million of wafer fabrication equipment  million of test equipment and million of mask sets 
we expect our capital spending in absolute dollars will be in the range of million to million  similar to and net cash provided by financing activities in was million 
in the second quarter of we received cash of million through the private placement of a convertible note with an affiliate of future  a related party 
in december  we entered into an agreement to terminate this note and accelerate the associated conversion rights 
as part of this agreement  we received million in cash for this note and forgiveness of  interest charges on both outstanding notes 
also  during  employee stock option exercises added million 
in the second quarter of we received cash of million net of placement agency fees and other costs  through the private placement of million shares of sipex common stock 
on september  we sold a convertible secured note the first note with an attached warrant to an affiliate of future  a related party  for an aggregate cash amount of million 
the first note was recorded at million and the attached warrant was recorded at million recorded to additional paid in capital based on their fair values at the date of issuance using the black scholes option pricing model 
the first note paid a coupon and was convertible after one year into million shares of sipex common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the private placement also included a warrant to purchase  shares of sipex common stock exercisable for a two year period beginning on the one year anniversary of the date of the issuance 
the exercise price for the warrant is equal to of the average closing price for the five days preceding the closing or 
on june  we issued a convertible secured note  second note  to an affiliate of future  a related party  for an aggregate cash amount of million 
the second note paid a coupon and was convertible over a four year period into million shares of sipex common stock at  contingent upon future s attainment of certain sales of our product 
in december  we entered into an agreement with the affiliates of future to amend certain terms of the first note and the second note 
the agreement  among other things  amended the second note to provide for full acceleration and vesting of the holder s conversion rights under the second note 
in addition  the agreement provided that  upon expiration or termination of the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended the hsr act  regulatory waiting period  the holder would convert the second note into million shares of our common stock at the original stated conversion price of per share 
in exchange for the full acceleration of the conversion rights under the second note  the holder paid us an additional million in cash  forgave  in currently accrued interest and agreed to eliminate our future interest obligations under the second note

factors affecting future results our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and difficult to predict and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect net sales and profitability from period to period  including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  competitive pressures on selling prices  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  the availability of foundry capacity  raw materials and assembly and test capacity  fluctuations in yields  changes in product mix  our ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  the introduction of products and technologies by our competitors  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  the level of orders received that can be shipped in a quarter  delays in shipments from our fabrication plant to assembly houses  our ability to manufacture in the correct mix to respond to orders on hand and new orders received in the future  the timing of investments in research and development  including tooling expenses associated with product development  process improvements and production  the level of future product returns  and the overall economic conditions in the united states and abroad 

table of contents due to the absence of substantial non cancelable backlog  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues and are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
for example  we have a minimum purchase arrangement with one of our suppliers based on requirements forecasted one year in advance 
our future revenues are difficult to predict and at times in the past we have failed to achieve revenue expectations 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
if revenue levels are below expectations for any reason  operating results are likely to be unfavorably affected 
we may also take steps to adjust our strategic product families and change our cost structure  which may result in our incurring additional restructuring  reorganization and other charges 
based on forecasts  we may increase our operating expenses for personnel and new product development and for inventory in anticipation of increasing sales levels  therefore  operating results would be worsened if increased sales are not achieved 
in addition  we are limited in our ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
in addition  our quarterly and annual operating results may continue to be affected by non cash charges against our net sales such as the fair value of conversion rights associated with the note issued to an affiliate of future  our largest distributor 
in this regard  non cash charges of million for the quarter ended september  and million for the quarter ended december  which reduced our net sales by such amounts and increased our net loss by the same amounts  adversely impacting our net loss per share 
the note associated with these non cash charges has been extinguished  and we will not incur additional non cash charges to sales from the second note 
from through  the semiconductor industry experienced a prolonged and severe downturn that adversely affected our results of operations 
our net sales before the non cash charge for the fair value of debt conversion rights for the year ended december  decreased from the corresponding prior year period 
our business depends on market demand for products using analog semiconductors 
prolonged downturns in the semiconductor industry lead to decreases in net sales levels and may cause continued losses and cash flow shortages 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could substantially negatively affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our auditors have informed our audit committee of the existence of reportable conditions in our internal control as part of the communications by our independent auditors  deloitte touche llp  or d t  to our audit committee with respect to d t s audit for the year ended december   d t informed the audit committee that they had identified the following reportable conditions in our internal control deficiencies in our process for deferring costs related to deferred sales to our largest distributor  future  and deficiencies in our accounting department and related reliance on manual reconciliations and analysis 
the reportable conditions noted above  if not addressed  could result in accounting errors such as those underlying the restatements of our consolidated financial statements more fully discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our failure to fully address these reportable conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
please see item a controls and procedures below 

table of contents if we are unable to promptly and effectively implement adequate controls  systems and procedures  we may continue to experience weaknesses in our internal controls and operations that could call into question the accuracy of our financial results and we may be unable to achieve section certification as mandated under the sarbanes oxley act 
as a result of the december  audit of the consolidated financial statements  our former auditors noted certain matters involving internal control and its operation that they considered to be material weaknesses under standards established by the american institute of certified public accountants 
material weaknesses are significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control that could adversely affect our ability to record  process  summarize and report financial data consistent with the assertions of management in the financial statements 
by definition  material weaknesses do not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that errors or fraud  in amounts that would be material in relation to the financial statements being audited  may occur and may not be detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions 
the material weaknesses noted during the audit resulted from the deficiencies in the systems and processes used in the preparation of the financial statements and the lack of proper management review and account analysis in certain areas 
although other areas were impacted by the material weaknesses  the most significant issues arising from the material weaknesses included inappropriate process and systems tracking of inventory  including significant manual reconciliations  as well as inappropriate and insufficient analysis performed in evaluating inventory costs capitalized and inventory excess and obsolete reserves established 
to ensure appropriate analysis  we must systemize processes by establishing appropriate guidelines that will reduce the level of manual reconciliations  as well as improve the account analysis methodologies and increase the level of supervisory and management review 
our ability to implement our business plan successfully in a volatile market requires effective management systems and a system of financial processes and controls 
in that regard  we are in the process of implementing a new enterprise requirements planning system 
if we are unable to maintain an adequate level of processes and controls and improve our systems  we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis and our business and stock price would be adversely affected 
in addition  we may be unable to achieve section certification as mandated by the sarbanes oxley act 
we may experience difficulties in developing and introducing new or enhanced products necessitated by technological advances 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to anticipate changes in market demand and evolving technologies 
to remain competitive  we must enhance our current products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological advancements and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
our products may be rendered obsolete if we fail to anticipate or react to change  and  as a result  our revenues and cash flow may be negatively impacted 
our success depends on our ability to develop new semiconductor devices for existing and new markets  to introduce these products in a timely manner and to have these products selected for design into new products of our customers 
the development of these new devices is highly complex and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development of new products 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including accurate new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  availability of foundry capacity  achievement of manufacturing yields  and market acceptance of our products and our customers products 
our success also depends upon our ability to accurately specify and certify the conformance of our products to applicable standards and to develop our products in accordance with customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost 
table of contents effectively as necessary to compete successfully 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner or in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or that these products will achieve market acceptance 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that our customers products will achieve market acceptance 
we depend on distributors who sell directly to oems 
approximately of our net sales for the twelve months ended december  are from shipments of our product to distributors who sell directly to oems 
our agreements with distributors contain limited provisions for return of our product  including stock rotations whereby distributors may return a percentage of their product based upon a percentage of their most recent three or six months shipments 
effective in the first quarter of  all distributors may return products on a three month cycle 
in addition  in certain circumstances upon termination of the distributor relationship distributors may return a percentage of purchases 
the loss of business from any of our significant distributors or the delay of significant orders from any of them  even if only temporary  could significantly reduce our income  delay recognition of revenue and impact our ability to accurately predict cash flow 
we estimate the amount of future returns and have established reserves for estimated returns based upon information including sales during the period into the distribution channel  reported sell through by distributors to oems  distributor inventory levels and the specific terms of the distributor agreements as well as historical returns experience 
we defer revenue on shipments to future until the product is resold by the distributor to the end user sell through 
these provisions  as well as the significant share ownership by future  cause management to conclude that reasonable estimates of price concessions and returns cannot be made at the time of shipment to future 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from future  a related party  and our revenues would likely decline significantly if future elects not to make  cancels  reduces or defers purchases of our products 
future has historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
it is our largest distributor worldwide  and accounted for of total net sales before taking into account non cash charges for the fair value of debt conversion rights for the twelve months ended december   and and of total net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that sales of our products to future will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
the loss of future as a distributor  or a significant reduction in orders from future would materially and adversely affect our operating results  our business  our financial condition and our stock price 
we have a distributor agreement with future that provides for future to act as our sole distributor for certain products within north america and europe 
sales to this distributor are made under an agreement that provides protection against price reduction for their inventory of sipex products 
sipex maintains a separate price list for products sold to future  which may be different from the prices charged to customers in direct sales transactions 
our distributor agreement with future does not contain minimum purchase commitments 
as a result  future could cease purchasing our products with short notice to us 
in addition  future may defer or cancel orders without penalty  which would likely cause our revenues  our business  our financial condition and our stock price to decline 
we may not successfully expand our sales and distribution channels 
an integral part of our strategy is to expand our sales and distribution channels 
we are increasing resources dedicated to developing and expanding these channels but we may not be successful doing so 
if we are successful in increasing our sales through indirect sales channels  we expect that those sales will be at lower per unit prices than sales through direct channels  and revenues we receive for each sale will be less than if we had sold the same product to the customer directly 
selling through indirect channels may also limit our contact with our customers 
as a result  our ability to accurately forecast sales  evaluate customer satisfaction and recognize emerging customer requirements may be hindered 
even if we successfully expand our distribution channels  any new distributors may not have the technical expertise required to market and support our products successfully 
if parties do not provide adequate levels of services and technical support  
table of contents our customers could become dissatisfied  we could be required to devote additional resources for customer support and our brand name and reputation could be negatively impacted 
our strategy of marketing products directly to our customers and indirectly through distributors may result in distribution channel conflicts 
affiliates of future  our largest distributor  beneficially own a significant percentage of our common stock  which will allow them to significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval and could discourage potential acquisitions of our company 
as of december   affiliates of future  our largest distributor  held approximately million shares of our common stock  or approximately  of our outstanding common stock 
during february  the affiliates of future exercised the conversion rights to convert their notes into our common stock for an additional million shares  bringing their ownership up to million shares of our outstanding capital stock 
the affiliates of future also continue to hold a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
affiliates of future are not currently represented on our board of directors and do not have contractual rights to such representation or to any participation in the corporate governance of sipex management 
due to their ownership of a significant percentage of our common stock  these security holders will be able to exert significant influence over actions requiring the approval of our shareholders  including many types of change of control transactions and amendments to our charter documents 
the significant ownership percentage of these security holders could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control sipex or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from obtaining control of sipex 
we may face significant risks related to our international operations 
we derive a significant portion of our net sales from international sales  including asia  which are subject to certain risks  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting our intellectual property overseas  the seasonality of sales  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
our international sales  excluding canada  in the twelve months period ended december  were million or of total net sales before fair value of debt conversion rights and million and million for the years ended and  respectively  or and of total net sales  respectively 
there can be no assurance that economic and geopolitical troubles in any area of the world will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our inability to meet any increase in demand could reduce our market share 
demand shifts in the semiconductor industry are rapid and difficult to predict  and we may not be able to respond quickly enough to an increase in demand  if any 
our ability to increase sales of our products depends  in part  upon our ability to optimize the use of our manufacturing capacity in a timely manner and  if necessary  expand our manufacturing capacity 
if we are unable to respond to rapid increases in demand  if 
table of contents any  for our products on a timely basis or to manage any corresponding expansion of our manufacturing capacity effectively  our customers could increase their purchases from our competitors  which would reduce our market share 
our financial results may be adversely affected due to the highly volatile optical storage market 
a significant component of our growth strategy depends on increasing shipments in the optical storage market 
during and  we derived all of our optical storage sales from a limited number of customers in japan 
local suppliers in japan may have a competitive advantage over sipex  which could adversely affect our ability to grow sales or continue to compete in japan or other regions of the world 
any failure to increase our shipments in the optical storage market could limit our ability to grow our business and could adversely affect our operating results 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors  we will experience fewer customer orders  reduced revenues  reduced gross margins and lost market share 
we compete in markets that are intensely competitive  and which are subject to both rapid technological change and continued price erosion 
our competitors include many large domestic and foreign companies that have substantially greater financial  technical and management resources than we have 
loss of competitive position could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced revenues  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which would affect our operating results and financial condition 
to remain competitive  we continue to evaluate our manufacturing operations  looking for additional cost savings and technological improvements 
if we are not able to successfully implement new process technologies and to achieve volume production of new products at acceptable yields  our operating results and financial condition may be affected 
in addition  if competitors in asia reduce prices on commodity products  it would adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in that region 
our future competitive performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to accurately identify emerging technological trends and demand for product features and performance characteristics  develop and maintain competitive products  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors  bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices  respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others  increase device performance and improve manufacturing yields  adapt products and processes to technological changes  and adopt and or set emerging industry standards 
there can be no assurance that our design  development and introduction schedules for new products or enhancements to our existing and future products will be met 
in addition  there can be no assurance that these products or enhancements will achieve market acceptance  or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable 
we have only limited protection for our proprietary technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
although we are not aware of any pending or threatened patent litigation that we consider material  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert claims against us with respect to existing or future products or technologies and we have been subject to such claims in the past 
in litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in our favor could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our management personnel from productive tasks 
in 
table of contents the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  we may be required to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  and expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  with respect to disputed third party technology 
in the event of a successful claim against us and our failure to develop or license a substitute technology at a reasonable cost  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that foreign intellectual property laws will protect our intellectual property rights 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around any of our patents 
we may be subject to  or may initiate  interference proceedings in the us patent office  which can demand significant financial and management resources 
our future success depends on retaining our key personnel and attracting and retaining additional highly qualified employees 
our success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  such as experienced analog circuit designers 
the competition for these employees is intense 
our employee s are employees at will  which means that they can terminate their employment at any time 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our design engineers  executive officers and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our design engineers  executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit replacements for these personnel or to otherwise attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could seriously impede our success 
we have recently experienced significant changes in senior management and our corporate organization 
our senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer  senior vice president of sales and vice president of engineering joined our company in in particular  our chief financial officer  phillip kagel  joined sipex in february  after the audit of our financial statements for the year ended december  was substantially complete 
changes in management may be disruptive to our business and may result in the departure of existing employees and or customers 
our manufacturing processes are very complex  which may result in manufacturing difficulties 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex and are continuously being modified in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
process changes can result in interruptions in production or significantly reduced yields causing product introduction or delivery delays 
in addition  yields can be adversely affected by minute impurities in the environment or other problems that occur in the complex manufacturing process 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose and are time consuming or expensive to remedy 
from time to time we have experienced unfavorable yield variances 
in particular  new process technologies or new products can be subject to especially wide variations in manufacturing yields and efficiency 
there can be no assurance that our foundries will not experience unfavorable yield variances or other manufacturing problems that result in delayed product introduction or delivery delays 
we rely on outside foundries to supply certain of our wafers and those foundries may not produce at acceptable levels 
we rely on outside foundries to supply certain of our fully processed semiconductor wafers 
this reliance on outside foundries presents the following potential risks lack of adequate wafer supply  limited control over delivery schedules  unavailability of or delays in obtaining access to key process technologies  and limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs 

table of contents additionally  the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process 
our third party foundries have  from time to time  experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields  particularly in connection with the introduction of new products and the installation and start up of new process technologies 
there can be no assurance that our outside foundries will not experience lower than expected manufacturing yields in the future 
additionally  we do not have a guaranteed level of production capacity at any of these foundries with the exception of one of our foundries for whom we provide minimum purchase commitments in accordance with our supply agreement announced on august  see note for commitments and contingencies 
the ability of each foundry to provide wafers to us is limited by the foundry s available capacity  and the foundry s allocation of its available capacity among multiple customers 
there can be no assurance that our third party foundries will allocate sufficient capacity to satisfy our requirements 
we have experienced decreased allocations of wafer supplies from our suppliers in the past  which reduced our capacity to ship products  and  thus  recognize revenues 
additionally  any sudden reduction or elimination of any primary source or sources of fully processed wafers could result in a material delay in the shipment of our products 
if any other delays or shortages occur in the future  our business and operating results will be negatively impacted 
our wafer fabrication facility and the facilities of certain of our significant customers and third party wafer suppliers are located in areas susceptible to earthquakes 
our in house fabrication facility and the facilities of certain of our significant customers and third party wafer suppliers are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes 
damage caused by earthquakes may result in shortages in water or electricity or transportation  which could limit the production capacity of our wafer facility and or the ability of certain of our subcontractors to provide needed products 
any reduction in production capacity or the ability to obtain fully processed semiconductor wafers could cause delays or shortages in our product supply  which would negatively impact our business 
if our facilities or the facilities of our customers are damaged by future earthquakes  it could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
we rely on outside suppliers to assemble  test and ship product to our customers 
we rely on outside assembly houses to assemble  test and ship our product to end customers 
there can be no assurance that our third party suppliers will allocate sufficient capacity to us to meet our requirements 
any sudden reduction or elimination of a primary source could result in material delay in the shipment of our product and could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 
we have limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs 
we have in the past experienced yield issues and delays 
we could experience delays or yield issues in the future due to the transfer of products from development to production  which could negatively impact our business and operating results 
we must comply with significant environmental regulations  which is difficult and expensive 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
any failure by us to control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances  or otherwise comply with environmental regulations  could subject us to significant future liabilities 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we have not violated laws or regulations in the past  which violations could result in remediation or other significant liabilities  or that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will not result in remediation or other significant liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations 

table of contents it would be difficult for us to adjust our spending significantly if we experience any revenue shortfalls 
our future revenues are difficult to predict and at times in the past we have failed to achieve our revenue expectations 
our expense levels are based in part  on our expectations of future revenues  and expense levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
since the fourth quarter of  we have adjusted our spending levels as a result of decreased revenues and continue to focus on controlling costs 
we may  however  be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
if revenue levels are below expectations for any reason our operating results will be negatively impacted 
due to the absence of substantial non cancelable backlog  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and often fluctuate substantially 
in the future  if we believe that demand is increasing  our operating expenses for personnel  new product development and for inventory would correspondingly increase as needed in anticipation of increasing sales levels 
our operating results would be negatively impacted if increased sales were not achieved 
in addition  we are limited in our ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
we may have capital requirements to maintain and grow our business and we may not be able to secure adequate capital on acceptable terms 
in order to remain competitive  we must continue to make investments in our facilities and capital equipment 
we obtained additional funding through the private placement of million shares of sipex common stock on april   which provided million  net of placement agent fees and other costs of issuance  and through the private placement of a convertible secured note and related warrant on september   which provided approximately million  net of costs of issuance 
we obtained funding from the private placement of a convertible secured note on june  which provided approximately million  net of costs of issuance 
in december  we entered into an agreement to amend both outstanding convertible notes and accelerated the associated conversion rights 
in connection with this agreement  we received million in cash 
during february  the note holders converted their notes into our common stock  resulting in dilution to our shareholders 
if we require additional financing  it may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us  and could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders 
our stock price has been volatile and could continue to remain volatile 
the trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor manufacturing and electronic markets  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent months 
in the fourth quarter of  our stock closing price ranged from a high of to a low of 
in the fourth quarter of  our stock closing price ranged from a high of to a low of 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we could face securities litigation if our stock price remains highly volatile 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often followed periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
in the past  we were named in two virtually identical securities class action lawsuits 
the complaints and unspecified damages alleged  among other things  that our financial statements for the second and third quarters of fiscal year contained incorrect statements 
on april   the us district court dismissed both suits with prejudice 
the litigation process is inherently uncertain and unpredictable  however  and there can be no guarantee that we will not become subject to such suits in the future 
moreover  there can be no guarantee that if we do become subject to such suits  that the ultimate outcome will be similar to the cases noted above 
any litigation 
table of contents could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could negatively impact our business 
changes in laws  regulations and financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations 
the recently enacted sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations may result in changes in accounting standards or accepted practices within our industry 
new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred in the past and are likely to occur in the future as a result of recent congressional and regulatory actions 
new laws  regulations  and accounting standards  as well as the questioning of  or changes to  currently accepted accounting practices in the technology industry may adversely affect our reported financial results  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
proposals have been made concerning the expensing of stock options which could result in rules or laws that may adversely affect our reported financial results and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
we are incurring additional costs and devoting more management resources to comply with increasing regulation of corporate governance and disclosure 
we are spending an increased amount of management time and external resources to understand and comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules listing requirements 
devoting the necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to these compliance activities 
the implementation of a new management information system may disrupt our business 
we are implementing a new enterprise resource planning and financial accounting and planning system starting in the first quarter of  and integrating this new system with our customer relationship management system and our product management system 
implementation of the new management information system  including the integration with other systems  is a very complex process that requires significant financial resources and personnel time  as well as unifying operating policies and procedures to ensure that the total system operates efficiently and effectively 
delays or errors in the implementation could result in additional costs and cause disruptions to our business  which could adversely affect our ability to accurately report our financial results on a timely basis and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we invest excess cash in financial investments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment strategy 
none of these market sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our portfolio 
the investment portfolio contains instruments that are subject to the risk of a decline in interest rates 
as required by our investment policy  available funds are invested in a manner that assures maximum safety and liquidity and  secondarily  maximizes yield within such constraints 
interest rate risk our financial investments consist primarily of high quality commercial paper and money market funds 
we do not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
the two debt instruments that we entered into had fixed interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or engage in hedging activities in our investment portfolio 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by 
table of contents limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities 
at december  we had short term investments of million 
our short term investments consisted of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of between day and days 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the company believes a hypothetical increase in market interest rates by from levels at december   would cause the fair value of these short term investments to fall by an immaterial amount 
since we are not required to sell these investments before maturity  we have the ability to avoid realizing losses on these investments due to a sudden change in market interest rates 
on the other hand  declines in the interest rates over time will reduce our interest income 
we had two outstanding convertible notes for million  at december  these instruments had a fixed interest rate of and per annum 
because the interest rates of these instruments were fixed  a hypothetical increase in interest rates will not have a material effect on our financials 
interest rate increases  however  will increase interest expense associated with future borrowings by us  if any 
we do not hedge against interest rate fluctuations 
also  these two convertible notes were subsequently converted to our common stock in february foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our sales  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  since a portion of our operations consists of sales activities outside of the us  we enter into transactions in other currencies 
we are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates for the euro  japanese yen  and british pound 
currently  we have no plan to enter into any foreign currency hedging program since the amounts involved have not been material 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in fiscal  and
