item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this information is incorporated by reference to the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report to stockholders included in exhibit to this report on form k 
this information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in exhibit to this report on form k and the discussion of risk factors below 
risk factors certain of the matters we discuss in this report on form k may constitute forward looking statements 
you can identify forward looking statements because they contain words such as believes  expects  may  will  should  seeks  approximately  intends  plans  estimates  or anticipates or similar expressions which concern our strategy  plans or intentions 
all statements we make relating to estimated and projected earnings  margins  costs  expenditures  cash flows  growth rates and financial results are forward looking statements 
in addition  we  through our senior management  from time to time make forward looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time  and  therefore  our actual results may differ materially from those we expected 
we derive most of our forward looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts  which are based upon many detailed assumptions 
while we believe that our assumptions are reasonable  we caution that it is very difficult to predict the 
table of contents impact of known factors  and  of course  it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results 
some of the factors that we believe could affect our results include general economic and market conditions  including the lingering effects of the economic slowdown on information technology spending levels  trading volumes and services revenue  and including the fact that the economic slowdown has left many companies with excess data center capacity that provides them with the capability for in house high availability solutions  the overall condition of the financial services industry  including the effect of any further consolidation among financial services firms  and including the market and credit risks associated with clearing broker operations  the integration of acquired businesses  the performance of acquired businesses including systems computer technology corporation  and the prospects for future acquisitions  the effect of war  terrorism or catastrophic events  the timing and magnitude of software sales  the timing and scope of technological advances  the ability to retain and attract customers and key personnel  and the ability to obtain patent protection and avoid patent related liabilities in the context of a rapidly developing legal framework for software and business method patents 
the factors described in this paragraph and other factors that may affect our business or future financial results  as and when applicable  are discussed in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  including this report on form k 
we assume no obligation to update any written or oral forward looking statement made by us or on our behalf as a result of new information  future events or other factors 
our business depends largely on the economy and financial markets  and a slowdown or downturn in general economics or financial market conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
when there is a slowdown or downturn in the economy  a drop in stock market levels or trading volumes  or an event that disrupts the financial markets  our business and financial results may suffer for a number of reasons 
customers may react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their spending on information technology 
in addition  customers may curtail or discontinue trading operations  delay or cancel information technology projects  or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts 
also  customers with excess data center capacity as a result of an economic slowdown may choose to take their high availability solutions in house rather than obtain those solutions from us 
moreover  competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers to lower cost solutions 
if any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time  there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results 
as a result of the recent economic slowdown  our internal growth steadily decreased  and almost all of our revenue growth during the past two years was from acquisitions 

table of contents our business depends largely on the financial services industry  and a weakening of the financial services industry could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
since our customer base is concentrated in the financial services industry  our business is largely dependent on the health of that industry 
when there is a general downturn in the financial services industry  or if our customers in that industry experience financial or business problems  our business and financial results may suffer 
if financial services firms continue to consolidate as they have over the past decade or so  there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
when a customer merges with a firm using its own solution or another vendor s solution  they could decide to consolidate their processing on a non sungard system  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
our acquisition program is a principal element of our strategy but  because of the uncertainties involved  this program may not be successful and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses 
there can be no assurance that our acquisition program will continue to be successful or that each acquisition will meet one of our important guidelines of being neutral or positive to our earnings within the first twelve months and thereafter 
if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses  or if acquired businesses perform poorly  then our business and financial results may suffer 
it is possible that the businesses we have acquired and businesses that we acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected 
if that happens  there may be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons  including we may have to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to acquired businesses  we may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from our acquisitions  and we may have to write off goodwill or other intangible assets 
if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates and successfully complete acquisitions  our growth will be slowed and our financial results may be adversely affected 
our growth has depended in part on our ability to acquire similar or complementary businesses on favorable terms 
in the last two years  virtually all of our growth was from acquired businesses 
this growth strategy is subject to a number of risks that could adversely affect our business and financial results  including we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms  we may face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers or from the possibility of the acquisition target pursuing an initial public offering of its stock  we may have to borrow money from a bank or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions as we did with the recent acquisition of systems computer technology corporation  and we may find it more difficult or costly to complete acquisitions due to changes in accounting  tax  securities or other regulations 

table of contents catastrophic events may disrupt or otherwise adversely affect the markets in which we operate  our business and our profitability 
our business may be adversely affected by a war  terrorist attack  natural disaster or other catastrophe 
a catastrophic event could have a direct negative impact on us or an indirect impact on us by  for example  affecting our customers  the financial markets or the overall economy 
the potential for a direct impact is due primarily to our significant investment in our infrastructure 
although we maintain redundant facilities and have contingency plans in place to protect against both man made and natural threats  it is impossible to fully anticipate and protect against all potential catastrophes 
despite our preparations  a security breach  criminal act  military action  power or communication failure  flood  severe storm or the like could lead to service interruptions and data losses for customers  disruptions to our operations  or damage to our important facilities 
any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our asp systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our reputation and our business 
our asp systems maintain and process confidential data on behalf of our customers  some of which is critical to their business operations 
for example  our brokerage and trading systems maintain account and trading information for our customers and their clients  and our benefit  insurance and investor accounting systems maintain investor account information for retirement plans  insurance policies and mutual funds 
if our asp systems are disrupted or fail for any reason  or if our systems or facilities are infiltrated or damaged by unauthorized persons  our customers could experience data loss  financial loss  harm to reputation and significant business interruption 
if that happens  we may be exposed to liability for security breaches  our customers may leave  our reputation may be tarnished  and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
because the sales cycle for our software is typically lengthy and unpredictable  our results may fluctuate from period to period 
our operating results may fluctuate and be difficult to predict due to the timing and magnitude of software sales 
we offer some of our investment support systems on a license basis  which means that the customer has the right to run the software on its own computers 
the customer usually makes a significant up front payment to license software  which we generally recognize as revenue when the license contract is signed and the software is delivered 
the size of the up front payment often depends on a number of factors that are different for each customer  such as the number of customer locations  users or accounts 
as a result  the sales cycle for a software license may be lengthy and take unexpected turns 
thus  it is difficult to predict when software sales will occur or how much revenue they will generate 
since there are few incremental costs associated with software sales  our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing and magnitude of software sales 
rapid technological and business changes could adversely affect our business 
our business may suffer if we do not successfully adapt our products and services to changes in technology and changes in our customers businesses 
these changes can occur rapidly and at unpredictable intervals 
if we do not successfully update and integrate our products and services to adapt to these changes  or if we do not successfully develop new products and services needed by our 
table of contents customers to keep pace with these changes  then our business and financial results may suffer 
our ability to keep up with technology and business changes is subject to a number of risks  including we may find it difficult or costly to update our products and services and to develop new products fast enough to meet our customers needs  we may find it difficult or costly to make some features of our products and services work effectively and securely over the internet  we may find it difficult or costly to integrate more of our investment support systems into efficient straight through processing solutions  and we may find it difficult or costly to update our products and services to keep pace with business  regulatory and other developments in the financial services industry  where many of our customers operate 
the trend towards high availability solutions will likely lower our margins and create pressure on our internal revenue growth in availability services 
among our largest customers  there is a trend toward high availability solutions rather than traditional recovery solutions 
the primary reason for this trend is that high availability solutions  although more costly  provide greater control and faster response to processing interruptions 
many customers prefer high availability solutions provided by us in order to take advantage of our business continuity expertise and resource management capabilities 
other customers  especially among the very largest having significant it resources  prefer in house high availability solutions  which often are facilitated by excess data center capacity resulting from the recent economic slowdown and by ongoing technological advances 
when an existing customer moves from one of our traditional solutions to one of our high availability solutions  there is a positive impact on our revenue  but usually at a lower margin 
although we cannot predict the exact mix of gains and losses that will result from the trend towards high availability solutions among the largest customers  we expect that this trend will continue to create pressure on our internal revenue growth rate in availability services 
we believe that future increases in internal revenue in availability services will depend  in part  on an improving economy  and that there will be a lag in time between an increase in technology spending and an increase in internal revenue in availability services 

table of contents our brokerage operations are highly regulated and are riskier than our other businesses 
organizations like the securities and exchange commission sec  new york stock exchange nyse and national association of securities dealers nasd can  among other things  fine  censure  issue cease and desist orders and suspend or expel a broker dealer or any of its officers or employees for failures to comply with the many laws and regulations that govern brokerage operations 
our ability to comply with these laws and regulations is largely dependent on our establishment  maintenance and enforcement of an effective brokerage compliance program 
our failure to establish  maintain and enforce proper brokerage compliance procedures  even if unintentional  could subject us to significant losses  lead to disciplinary or other actions  and tarnish our reputation 
we are exposed to certain risks due to the trading activities of our customers and professional traders of our brokerage operations 
if customers or professional traders fail to pay for securities they buy  or fail to cover their short sales  or fail to repay margin loans we make to them  then we may suffer losses  and these losses may be disproportionate to the revenue and profit contributions of this business 
in our other businesses  we generally can disclaim liability for trading losses that may be caused by our software  but in our brokerage operations  we cannot limit our liability for trading losses even when we are not at fault 
if we are unable to retain or attract customers  our business and financial results will be adversely affected 
if we are unable to keep existing customers satisfied  sell additional products and services to existing customers or attract new customers  then our business and financial results may suffer 
a variety of factors could affect our ability to successfully retain and attract customers  including the level of demand for our products and services  the level of customer spending for information technology  the level of competition from internal customer solutions and from other vendors  the quality of our customer service  our ability to update our products and develop new products and services needed by customers  and our ability to integrate and manage acquired businesses 
our services revenue  which has been largely recurring in nature  comes from the sale of our products and services under fixed term contracts 
we do not have a unilateral right to extend these contracts when they expire 
if customers cancel or refuse to renew their contracts  or if customers reduce the usage levels or asset values under their contracts  there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
in availability services  customer retention risks have been amplified by recent acquisitions and other factors 
compared to our historical availability services customer base  the customer bases acquired in and had shorter average remaining contract terms 
consequently  there has been a significant increase in the amount and percentage of annual availability services revenue subject to renewal 
as we have been seeking to renew shorter term availability services contracts  we often have been agreeing to lower monthly fees in exchange for longer contract commitments  which has been having a negative impact on revenue and revenue growth rates in this segment 
if we fail to retain key employees  our business may be harmed 
our success depends on the skill  experience and dedication of our employees 
if we are unable to retain and attract sufficiently experienced and capable personnel  especially in product development  sales and management  our business and financial results may suffer 
for example  if we are unable to retain and attract a sufficient number of skilled technical personnel  our ability to develop high quality 
table of contents products and provide high quality customer service may be impaired 
experienced and capable personnel in the technology industry remain in high demand  and there is continual competition for their talents 
when talented employees leave  we may have difficulty replacing them  and our business may suffer 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and attract the personnel that we need 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary technologies and defend infringement claims  we could lose our competitive advantage and our business could be adversely affected 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary products and services and to defend against infringement claims 
if we are unable to do so  our business and financial results may suffer 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely upon a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret law  confidentiality restrictions in contracts with employees  customers and others  software security measures  and registered copyrights and patents 
despite our efforts to protect the proprietary technology  unauthorized persons may be able to copy  reverse engineer or otherwise use some of our technology 
it also is possible that others will develop and market similar or better technology to compete with us 
furthermore  existing patent and copyright laws may afford only limited protection  and the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary technology as well as united states law 
for these reasons  we may have difficulty protecting our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use 
if any of these events happens  there could be a material adverse effect on the value of our proprietary technology and on our business and financial results 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
this type of litigation is often costly and time consuming  with no assurance of success 
the legal framework for software and business method patents is rapidly evolving  and it is possible that others may patent technology similar to ours and may assert infringement claims against us 
these claims may be difficult and costly to defend and may lead to unfavorable judgments or settlements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
for these reasons  we may find it difficult or costly to add or retain important features in our products and services
