the company does not depend on any single drug or therapeutic category for a majority of its sales 
critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are those policies that are important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and require management s subjective judgments 
as a result  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
the company bases its judgments on its experience and various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenues  returns  inventories  income taxes and litigation 
the company s actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following accounting policies to be critical sales are recognized when the products are received by the customer  which represents the point when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer 
discounts  rebates and contract pricing adjustments are recorded as a reduction of sales based on agreed upon terms with the company s customers at the time of sale 
the company calculates a reserve for discounts and rebates based upon actual sales under such arrangements 
reserves for contract pricing adjustments represent the difference between the prices wholesalers are billed by the company and the contract prices billed by wholesalers to their customers 
in determining a reserve for contract pricing adjustments  the company takes into account an estimate of the percentage of product sales subject to such pricing adjustments based on historical trends 
historical trends are adjusted for new product introductions and changes in wholesaler or contract prices 
shelf stock adjustments are provided following a reduction in the prices of any of the company s products due to the competitive environment 
such adjustments are credited to the company s customers based on their on hand inventory quantities 
reserves are generally established when the company reduces its prices 
estimates for returns  which are recorded at the time of sale  relate primarily to returns of expiring products 
the company utilizes historical trends to estimate the amount of products to be returned due to product expiration 
in determining whether liabilities should be recorded for pending litigation claims  the company must assess the allegations made and the likelihood that it will successfully defend itself 
when the company believes it is probable that it will not prevail in a particular matter  it will then make an estimate of the amount of liability based in part on advice of outside legal counsel

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no

it requires that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee if that amount is reasonably estimable  and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions for initial recognition and measurement of the liability are to be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified on or after january  the company s initial adoption of this statement on january  did not have an impact on its results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses the company s exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not believe that its exposure to market risk is material 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash equivalents are interest bearing investment grade securities  primarily short term  highly liquid investments with maturities at the date of purchase of less than days 
in addition  the company currently owns million in publicly traded debt securities with an average maturity of approximately days  which are subject to market fluctuations 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical increase in the market interest rates by percent from the rates in effect on the date of this form k would cause the fair value of these short term investments to decline by an insignificant amount 
the company has the ability to hold these investments until maturity  and therefore it does not expect the value of these investments to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce the company s interest income 
the company currently does not have any significant foreign currency exchange rate risk
