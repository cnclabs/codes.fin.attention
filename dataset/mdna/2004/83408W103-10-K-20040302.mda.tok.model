item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sohu  having introduced the first chinese language online directory  is one of the leading internet portals in china in terms of brand recognition 
we are a delaware corporation 
on october   sohu acquired chinaren for total consideration of million  comprising  shares of sohu common stock with an aggregate market value of approximately million  stock options granted to chinaren employees to purchase  shares of sohu common stock valued at million and other acquisition costs aggregating million 
chinaren was at the time of acquisition  and currently is  the leading alumni club in china  which is a community where students or alumni can register for classes and communicate with fellow classmates and colleagues 
revenues and expenses from chinaren s operations after the acquisition date have been included in sohu s consolidated financial statements 
prior to december   most of the services were free for the alumni club and the amount of revenue from chinaren was insignificant  as were operating expenses 
during the year ended december   we had revenues of approximately million from chinaren  and operating expenses were insignificant 
in october  the audit committee of our board of directors pre approved the provision by our auditor  pricewaterhousecoopers  of agreed upon services associated with historical information of all honest international limited  acquired by sohu in november on november   sohu  through sohu 
com limited  acquired kylie enterprises limited for total consideration of million including million in cash and  in acquisition expenses 
kylie enterprises limited is the owner of com  a web site providing information about multiplayer online games in the people s republic of china 
revenues of  and expenses of  from kylie enterprises limited s operations after the acquisition date have been included in sohu s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  on november   we completed  through sohu 
com limited  the acquisition of all honest international limited  a company organized under the laws of the british virgin islands and the owner of focus 
cn  a web site providing information about real estate in beijing and shanghai 
the maximum total purchase price for the focus acquisition was approximately million including  in acquisition expenses 
this price consisted of i million in cash  of which million was paid at the closing under a certain stock purchase agreement  million was transferred to an escrow account subject to post closing contingencies and was released to the seller days after the closing  and  will be paid in  ii  shares of the common stock of sohu 
com inc valued at their market price  totaling approximately million around the dates of november   the commitment date  and november   the date the transaction was publicly announced  of which  shares were transferred at closing and  shares will be transferred in  and iii the remaining amount  if any  will be determined based upon revenues contributed from the focus web site for the year ending december   up to a maximum of  in cash 
revenues of  and expenses of  from all honest international s operations after the acquisition date have been included in sohu s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we incurred significant net losses from our inception in august through the quarter ended june  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million at december  these losses have been funded with the private placements of convertible preferred stock and our initial public offering 
we intend to continue spending on marketing and brand development  content enhancements  technology and infrastructure 
as a result  net losses could occur in the future 
we anticipate funding any such losses with the remaining proceeds from our initial public offering and the proceeds of the private placement of zero coupon convertible senior notes that we completed in july critical accounting policies sohu s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon sohu s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires sohu to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  sohu evaluates its estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
sohu believes accounting for advertising revenue  accounting for e subscriptions revenues and cost of revenues  gross versus net basis of revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and valuation allowance against deferred tax assets represent critical accounting policies that reflect more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we generate advertising revenue from standard  sponsorship and retail contracts  most of which are one year or less in duration 
such contracts establish the fixed price and advertising services to be provided 
pursuant to advertising contracts  we provide advertisement placements on various web site channels and in different formats  including but not limited to banners  links  logos  buttons  content integration and email marketing 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period the advertising is provided and  as such  we consider the services to have been delivered 
based upon our credit assessments of our customers prior to entering into contracts  we determine if collectibility is reasonably assured 
in situations where collectibility is not deemed to be reasonably assured  we recognize revenue upon payment from the customer 
sponsorship contracts may include services similar to those in our standard advertising contracts  are generally for larger dollar amounts and for a longer period of time  may allow advertisers to sponsor a particular area on our web site  may include brand affiliation services and or a larger volume of services  and may require some exclusivity or premier placements 
sponsorship advertisement revenues are normally recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period and when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured provided we are meeting our obligations under the contract 
pursuant to retail advertising contracts  which are normally for lower dollar amounts and are with small and medium size enterprises  we provide services which include listings in our search directory or our classified advertisements section  normally for a fixed annual fee  and priority placements on search results for a fixed fee or variable pricing based on bidding by different competitors 
for retail advertising contracts  revenue is recognized as the service is provided  which is normally on a straight line basis over the term of the contract  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
e subscription revenues and corresponding cost of revenues are included within non advertising revenues and cost of revenues and are derived principally from providing value added wireless services such as alumni club  dating and friends matching  e mail  ringtone and logo downloads and various other related products to mobile phone users 
e subscription fees are charged on a monthly or per message basis 
e subscription revenues and cost of revenues are recognized in the month in which the service is performed  provided no significant sohu obligations remain 
we rely on a number of mobile network operators in china to bill mobile phone users for e subscription fees 
in order to meet ownership requirements under prc law which restrict or prohibit us from being an internet content provider or directly providing telecommunications services such as e subscriptions  we rely on beijing sohu to contract with the mobile operators 
generally  i within to days after the end of each month  beijing sohu or sohu internet receives a statement from each of the operators confirming the amount of e subscription charges billed to that operator s mobile phone users and ii within to days after delivering a monthly statement to beijing sohu or sohu internet each operator remits the e subscription fees  net of its service fees  for the month to beijing sohu or sohu internet  which then transfers the funds to our subsidiaries beijing itc or sohu era 
in order to recognize revenue and get paid for services provided  we rely on billing confirmations from the mobile network operators as to the actual amount of services they have billed to their mobile customers 
we do not collect e subscription fees from an operator in certain circumstances due to technical issues with the operator s network 
this is referred to as the failure rate  which can vary from operator to operator 
an operator s failure rate can vary from month to month  and in the past has ranged from to with average failure rates of approximately over the past six months 
the failure rate may change at any time without notice 
if an operator encounters technical problems  increases in the failure rate for that operator could occur 
bmcc is currently in the process of establishing a new billing platform and may require us to switch to this platform in the future 
the new platform may result in higher failure rates or lower revenue as a result of more stringent billing procedures 
at the end of each reporting period  where an operator has not provided beijing sohu or sohu internet with the monthly statement for any month confirming the amount of e subscription charges billed to that operator s mobile phone users for the month  sohu  using information generated from its own internal system and historical data  makes estimates of the failure rate and collectable e subscription fees and accrues revenue accordingly 
the quarterly historical differences in our estimated revenue which was recorded in the financial statements compared to the actual revenue have ranged from an underestimation of  gross margin underestimate of  to an overestimation of  gross margin overestimate of 
we believe we have the ability to make a reasonable estimate 
however  material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue and non advertising cost of revenue for any period because of differences between the actual failure rate per an operator s statement and our internal records 
e commerce revenues are earned from direct sales of consumer products through sohu s web site 
in  we established store 
sohu 
com  where we undertake fulfillment e commerce activities and conduct e commerce transactions 
our e commerce products consist of over  consumer products such as books  health care products  cosmetics  videos  music and computer equipment 
we purchase products from suppliers  stock the goods in our warehouse and  upon receiving the orders from our web site  arrange for delivery to our customers  most of whom are individuals in beijing  shanghai and guangzhou 
fulfillment is provided by delivery companies or through postal services 
substantially all sales are done on a cash on delivery basis 
product sales include the right of return within days after the goods have been received if the products have quality problems and the buyer has retained the original order form 
we record product sales net of the estimated amount of returns 
we estimate an amount of product returns that is not significant 
our management must determine whether to record revenue for our e subscriptions and e commerce business lines using the gross or net method of reporting 
determining whether revenue should be reported gross or net is based on an assessment of various factors  principally whether sohu is acting as the principal in offering services to the customer or whether sohu is acting as an agent in the transaction 
to the extent sohu is acting as a principal in a transaction sohu reports as revenue the payments received on a gross basis and reports as costs of revenue the amounts attributable to goods and services provided by third party operators and other vendors 
to the extent sohu is acting as an agent in a transaction sohu reports as revenue the payments received less commissions and other payments to third parties  ie  on a net basis 
the determination of whether sohu is serving as principal or agent in a transaction is judgmental in nature and based on an evaluation of the terms of an arrangement 
based on our assessment  our e subscriptions revenues are recorded on a gross basis 
we have primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the e subscription services 
the content and nature of the e subscription services are designed and developed by us either independently or with third parties and originate from our web sites  our links located on third parties web sites  or one of our dedicated phone numbers 
the mobile operators that we contract with to deliver these services to the end customers are not involved in the design or development of the services that are provided by us 
the end customer purchases the wireless content  community access or value added services  such as our online dating  mobile email and mobile alumni club that sohu provides 
the end customer receives identical services from us regardless of which third party mobile operator is used to deliver the message 
in addition  when customers register on sohu s web sites to use e subscription services  they execute an online contract with us that sets forth our obligations to the customer and the terms of the service that will be provided 
sohu has determined that in addition to the indicators of gross reporting  there are also certain indicators of net reporting  including the fact that the mobile operators set maximum prices that sohu can charge and that the contracts call for the assumption of credit risk by the mobile operators after a certain fixed percentage is paid by sohu as an estimated bad debt expense 
this is part of the overall fees paid to the operators 
the mobile operators also have the right to set regulations and procedures associated with using their platform 
however  sohu has determined that the gross revenue reporting indicators are stronger  because sohu is the primary obligor  adds value to the products  has inventory risk related to content and products  and has reasonable pricing latitude 
the majority of our e commerce revenues are recorded on a gross basis where sohu is the primary obligor but  depending on the terms of particular contracts with our suppliers  the net basis is also used 
sohu considers itself the primary obligor in situations where sohu has general and physical inventory risk and where we can set prices without any involvement from the suppliers 
transactions related to certain technology products  such as cameras  computers and memory cards  are recorded on a net basis when the suppliers set minimum prices  sohu does not have inventory risk  does not maintain inventory to meet estimated customer demand and orders goods from suppliers only after receiving orders from customers 
to the extent revenues are recorded gross  any commissions or other payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount gross revenues  less expenses flows through operating income 
accordingly  the impact on operating income is the same whether sohu records the revenue on a gross or net basis 
our management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  if the financial condition of sohu s customers or telecom operators were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowance might be required 
as of december   all of our deferred tax assets are related to united states net operating losses 
because most of our income is earned in china  and we do not intend in the foreseeable future to repatriate this income to the united states where it would be taxable and the existence of future stock option deductions would preclude us from using our net operating losses  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets in order to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if events were to occur in the future that would allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax assets that would increase income for the period when those events occurred 
during the year ended december   sohu recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the remaining balance of identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to its acquisition of chinaren  inc this was the result of sohu s impairment assessment which was based upon an estimate of future discounted cash flows over the assets estimated useful lives 
if different judgments or estimates had been utilized  material differences could have resulted in the amount and timing of the impairment charge 
results of operations revenues total revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
advertising revenues advertising revenues were million  million  and million or   and of total revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase of million from to consisted of million from new advertisers  as more companies using the internet as an advertising medium  a million increase in revenues from the advertisers who advertised with us in fiscal year and who continued to do so in  and million increase in revenues fees we receive for listing companies in our search directory 
these increases were partly offset by a million loss in revenues  resulting from some of our advertisers not advertising on our web site in the increase in revenue also includes the impact of an increase in rates we charge for advertising of approximately or  approximately million of the million increase  from to sohu had approximately advertisers in as compared to advertisers in advertising revenue grew by million from to as we launched our paid search directory listing business in  which contributed million to the growth  with the balance resulting from more advertisers advertising on our web site 
sales to sohu s five largest advertisers were   and of total advertising revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
advertising revenues for the year ended december  included advertising revenues from related parties of  there were no advertising revenues from related parties in or we have not recorded any revenue from advertising barter transactions 
as of december  and  we had million and million of deferred revenues  respectively 
non advertising revenues non advertising revenues  which have been the fastest growing part of our business  are derived principally from monetizing our users ie consumers via e subscription services 
non advertising revenues were million  million  and million or   and of total revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these revenues were primarily generated from business lines which were put into operation in and  thus  the non advertising revenues in were not significant 
non advertising revenues for the years ended december   and included non advertising revenues from beijing sohu and sohu internet  of million  million  and million  respectively 
because of restrictions on foreign companies working in the prc telecommunications industry  we have used beijing sohu and sohu internet to contract on our behalf with prc mobile network operators who provide the gateway for sending messages and collect our short messaging fees 
beijing sohu and sohu internet collect the fees from the operators and then transfer them to our subsidiaries 
there was no material impact on our revenues or margins from our reliance on these related party arrangements 
on july   we prospectively adopted fin  which resulted in the consolidation of our variable interest entities  including beijing sohu and sohu internet 
thus  e subscription and e commerce revenues earned by beijing sohu and sohu internet after this date are not disclosed as revenue from related parties 
in  non advertising revenues were derived from e subscription fees of million  e commerce services of million  and e technology and other services of  in  non advertising revenues were derived from e subscription fees of million  e commerce services of million  and e technology and other services of  in  non advertising revenues comprised million of e subscription fees  million of e commerce services  and  of e technology and other services 
most of the growth in non advertising revenues was attributable to increases in e subscriptions revenue associated with our wireless services which include short messaging services  multi messaging services launched in and other advanced second generation technology or g wireless services 
for the year ended december   e subscriptions revenue increased by million from the increase was attributable to increases in the wireless user base for our web based products as well as new products for use with mobile phones 
for the year ended december   approximately of e subscriptions revenues were derived from providing wireless services  such as alumni club  dating and friends matching  e mail  ringtone and logo downloads and various other related products  to mobile phone users 
short messaging fees are charged on a monthly or per message basis 
as of december   approximately of our short messaging revenue is from consumers who subscribe for monthly services  for which we charge a monthly fee ranging from approximately to our wireless services were introduced in china in late and our growth in this area over the past year has been mainly attributable to a combination of a number of factors  such as increases in the number of chinese mobile phone users who have been subscribing for our wireless services and our introduction of new products to the market 
the unique characteristics of the china mobile phone and internet users are important factors for the growth of this business 
product development is especially important because these services have only recently become available in china and some of the services we offer are unique to china 
as of december   we provided over different monthly subscription wireless services and over services which are charged on a per message basis 
we regularly introduce new products and adaptations to our existing products 
depending on the product  subscribers may use the product for as short as one month or may use it on an ongoing basis 
as described below  there are certain products and marketing methods which have contributed to our growth 
price increases have not been a factor in our short messaging growth  because we have many different products and pricing is normally set when the product is launched and remains unchanged during the life of the product 
approximately of our growth in was attributable to improvements in the short messaging billing and transmission platform  as our approximate billing failure rate during the year ended december  was  as compared to approximately for the year ended december  during the past twelve months the largest contributor to our wireless related e subscriptions growth has been our online dating and friends matching service  which we refer to as jiqinggongshe or ggmm  and accounted for approximately of our wireless revenue in we developed this product in the fourth quarter of  and it accounted for approximately of our revenue in the fourth quarter of and of our e subscriptions revenue for the twelve months ended december  most of our ggmm subscribers were acquired through web site union  where we used third party web sites to market our products 
at the instruction of the mobile operators  we stopped using web site union in july we also used web site union for marketing numerous other products  which  excluding ggmm  accounted for approximately of our total revenue for the twelve months ended december  as a result of our inability to use web site union to promote our products or acquire subscribers  we experienced substantially lower growth in e subscriptions revenue for the three months ended september  and december  as compared to the three months ended june   march  and december  our subscriber base for products previously promoted through web site union especially ggmm are declining  which is having a negative impact on our revenue growth 
our ggmm subscribers have declined from a high of million in april to million at december  we charge a monthly fee of us for ggmm 
our future growth in e subscriptions revenue could be materially less than historical growth 
the future growth and sustainability of our e subscription revenues is dependent upon user acceptance of our existing and new services  especially services  such as ggmm  which are paid by way of monthly subscriptions 
because these services are new and untested  we do not have a clear understanding of consumer behavior  making it difficult to predict future growth or usage 
e commerce revenues are earned from direct sales of consumer products through sohu s web site 
in  we established store 
sohu 
com  where we undertake fulfillment e commerce activities and conduct e commerce transactions 
our e commerce products consist of over  consumer products  such as books  health care products  videos  music and computer equipment 
we purchase products from suppliers  stock the goods in our warehouse and  upon receiving the orders from our web site  arrange for delivery to our customers  most of whom are individuals in beijing  shanghai and guangzhou 
fulfillment is provided by delivery companies or through postal services 
substantially all sales are done on a cash on delivery basis 
e commerce revenue decreased by  to million for the twelve months ended december  because we discontinued sales of cosmetics in the quarter ended september  e commerce revenues increased from million in to million in  as we first launched e commerce in e technology and other services include our design of web sites and provision of internet software to third parties 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
advertising cost of revenues advertising cost of revenues includes personnel costs and personnel overhead  content purchases  depreciation and bandwidth  which are fairly fixed in nature and accordingly do not tend to increase or decrease proportionately with revenue 
our advertising gross margin for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  our gross margins improved because of the fixed nature of the advertising costs of revenues  which have not increased at the same rate as revenue 
our gross margin improved from in to in  as revenues increased by million from million in to million in and the actual cost of revenues decreased by  from million in to million in  primarily due to lower cost of bandwidth associated with falling prices and lower personnel cost associated with less headcount after the rationalization of our acquisition of chinaren 
advertising cost of revenues was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase for the year ended december  from the year ended december  of million was primarily due to higher spending on headcount of  and an increase in spending for content of  as we expanded our channel offerings

non advertising cost of revenues non advertising cost of revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively

prior to our adoption of fin on july   which resulted in the consolidation of our variable interest entities  substantially all non advertising cost of revenues was from related parties 
our e subscriptions gross margin for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  e subscriptions cost of revenues was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which consists mainly of subscription collection and wireless transmission charges paid to third party network operators 
the fees vary between third party operators and include a gateway fee of to per message  depending on the volume of the monthly total wireless messages  and a collection fee of to  based on the total fees collected by the third party operators from mobile phone users and paid to us 
as the operator fees are charged on a per message basis and as a percentage of revenue  the increase in e subscriptions cost of revenues is consistent with our increase in wireless revenues 
content costs are also included in e subscription cost of revenues but are immaterial as compared to collection and transmission charges 
e subscription cost of revenues does not include allocations for web site operating costs 
subsequent to the adoption of fin  e subscription cost of revenue also includes the business tax paid when vies remit to our subsidiaries e subscription fees which have been collected by the vies 
the increase in gross margins over the past three years is mainly due to a higher mix of monthly subscriptions  which have higher gross margins 
there have been no significant changes in the third party network operator fees over the past two years 
our e commerce gross margin for the twelve months ended december  was as compared to for the twelve months ended december  and for the twelve months ended december  our gross margins decreased from due to market price competition and the fact that we started providing free shipping in  which increased our non advertising cost of revenues 
for the twelve months ended december  and  non advertising cost of revenues included million  million and million  respectively  in e commerce cost of revenues  consisting of the purchase price of consumer products and inbound and outbound shipping charges 
e commerce cost of revenues does not include allocations for web site operating costs 
the change in e commerce cost of revenues from the comparative periods in and is attributable to the change in sales volume

product development expenses product development expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
product development expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to increased salary expense of million for additional employees to support our increased investment in our products and online games development  game license fees of  traveling and entertainment of  and training  communications  and office expense of  there was no significant change for as compared to sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  primarily due to increased advertising and promotion expense of million to support our marketing strategy  increased personnel expenses of  primarily the result of increased bonuses and commissions from increased advertising revenues  and traveling  entertainment and office expense of  the decrease from to was primarily due to the reduction in advertising expenses because of lower spending on sohu branding 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to due mainly to increased professional fees of million and salary expenses and office expense of  the decrease of  from to was primarily due to reduced spending on personnel costs 
amortization and impairment of intangible assets intangible assets of million  including  for assembled workforce and million in goodwill which arose as a result of the october  acquisition of chinaren  were originally being amortized over two years 
during the year ended december   sohu performed an impairment assessment and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to write off the remaining balance of identifiable intangibles and goodwill  primarily due to the overall decline in the industry growth rates and the sustained decline in sohu s stock price

prior to the adoption of fin in july  to the extent losses were incurred by these prc companies  we accrued for such losses by recording a valuation allowance against long term loans to related parties 
for the year ended december   other expense of  primarily resulted from a  writedown of other assets 
interest income interest income was million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of  from was mainly due to our increased cash balance and marketable securities as a result of our private placement of zero coupon convertible senior notes in july and an increase in our profits from fiscal to fiscal the  reduction in interest income from to resulted primarily from lower interest rates 
income tax expense income tax expense was million for the year ended december  and for the corresponding periods in and the increase in income tax expense was due to income tax expense associated with a tax restructuring undertaken during the third quarter of and other taxable income

however if we undertake new businesses in china which do not meet the requirements of a new technology enterprise  we will be subject to taxation on this income at 
accordingly  our future effective tax rate could vary between and due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the relevant income contribution by chinese entities taxed at to and us operations taxed at or  the ability of our operating subsidiaries to meet the requirements of a new technology enterprises  which are taxed at a maximum of which is less than the normal china corporate tax rate of  dividends paid by the subsidiaries in china or intermediate holding companies to sohu

we have filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to register for resale the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
however  until the registration statement becomes effective  the notes may be offered and sold only in transactions that are exempt from registration under the us securities act of and the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction 
our principal commitments consist of obligations under various operating leases for office facilities in beijing  shanghai  guangzhou and hong kong 
our commitments under these leases total approximately million   and  for the years ending december    and  respectively 
we expect that capital expenditures totalling million in will consist of million for purchases of servers  network equipment and software and million for leasehold improvements 
as described above  we have entered into arrangements with dr 
charles zhang  our president and chief executive officer  and certain of our employees to satisfy prc regulations which prohibit or restrict foreign companies from owning or operating telecommunications  internet content and certain other businesses in china 
these arrangements have taken the form of loans to dr 
zhang and the employees  who then invested the amounts loaned in what are currently our variable interest entities 
while the arrangements have taken the form of loans to dr 
zhang and the employees  they are  in substance  investments in the variable interest entities 
accordingly  we do not expect the loans to have any special effect upon our liquidity 
the loan agreements do not contain any material financial covenants

for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities of million was primarily due to long term investments in marketable debt securities of million  the acquisition of fixed assets of million  long term loans to related parties of million for financing investments in high century and hengda and the acquisition of other assets of  for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities of million was primarily due to long term investments in marketable debt securities of million and the acquisition of fixed assets of million  long term loans to related parties of million for financing an investment in high century and the acquisition of other assets of  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   due to net proceeds of million from the private placement of our zero coupon convertible senior notes and proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options granted under our stock incentive plan 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to the repurchase of million of shares of our outstanding common stock offset by the issuance of common stock of  pursuant to our stock incentive plan 
there was no significant cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  we believe that current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital net cash used in operating activities  commitments and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we may  however  require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if these sources are insufficient to satisfy cash requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to shareholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict operations 
financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
at december   we have an unused credit facility whereby we can borrow up to million by providing marketable securities on deposit with the financial institution as collateral 
foreign currency exchange losses while our reporting currency is the us dollar  to date virtually all of our revenues and costs are denominated in renminbi and a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in renminbi 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollars and renminbi 
if the renminbi depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our renminbi revenues and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
we do not hold any derivative or other financial instruments that expose us to substantial market risk 
see risk factors we may suffer currency exchange losses if the renminbi depreciates relative to the us dollar 
the renminbi is currently freely convertible under the current account  which includes dividends  trade and service related foreign exchange transactions  but not under the capital account  which includes foreign direct investment 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all 
accordingly  we may incur economic losses in the future due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our revenues  expenses and liabilities are denominated in chinese renminbi 
thus  revenues and operating results may be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations in the renminbi when financial results are translated in us dollars on consolidation 
currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency exchange may adversely affect our business  including limiting the ability to convert chinese renminbi into foreign currencies and  if the renminbi were to decline in value  reducing revenue in us dollar terms 
we have not tried to reduce exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by using hedging transactions but may choose to do so in the future 
we may not be able to do this successfully 
accordingly  we may experience economic losses and negative impacts on earnings and equity as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on us in the fiscal year ended december  was not material 
investment risk a investments in beijing sohu  sohu internet  high century and hengda we have entered into the following arrangements with dr 
charles zhang  our chief executive officer and a major sohu shareholder  and certain of our employees to satisfy prc regulations which prohibit or restrict foreign companies from owning or operating telecommunications  internet content and certain other businesses in china 
we expect that we will continue to be involved in and provide additional financial support under similar arrangements in the future 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  issuers subject to the act are prohibited from making personal loans to their directors and executive officers 
under section  issuers are permitted to maintain the loans they made to directors and executive officers prior to the effective date of the sarbanes oxley act 
they are not permitted  however  to renew or materially modify such loans 
we believe that there is a strong argument that the loans to dr 
zhang described below are not personal loans  in view of our underlying business purpose for making the loans and the lack of a personal benefit to dr 
zhang from the loans 
in the absence of judicial interpretation  an sec rule  or an sec staff interpretation confirming our conclusion  however  we intend to treat these loans as if they were personal loans under section of the sarbanes oxley act 
accordingly  we expect that if we enter into arrangements similar to those described below in the future  any loans made under such arrangements will be made to individuals who are not our directors or executive officers 
in addition  should the existing loans to dr 
zhang  or to the entities in which he is the primary shareholder  need to be renewed or materially modified  such as if we need to advance additional funds to any of these entities  we expect that the entities  the ownership of the entities and or the loans to the entities will be restructured so that we could not be deemed to be making a loan to dr 
zhang 
the prohibitions set forth in section have not had any adverse effect on our operations to date  and we do not expect them to have any adverse effect in the future 
in june  we extended loans in the amount of  to dr 
charles zhang and  to he jinmei  another employee of sohu  to finance their investments in beijing sohu  a company incorporated in the prc 
the shareholders of beijing sohu have pledged their shares in beijing sohu as collateral for the loan 
these loans bear no interest and are due in full on the earlier of demand  in or at such time as dr 
charles zhang or he jinmei  as the case may be  is not an employee of sohu 
a subsidiary of sohu has entered into an option agreement giving it the right  at any time  subject to prc law  to purchase the entire ownership in beijing sohu from the two beijing sohu shareholders for  in november  we entered into a loan and share pledge agreement with dr 
charles zhang  and li wei  another employee of sohu  for the purpose of funding an equity investment of approximately million by these two individuals in high century  a company incorporated in the prc which engages in investment holding in the prc on behalf of sohu 
pursuant to the loan agreement  we have extended total loans amounting to million of which million and  were loaned to charles zhang and li wei  respectively 
in january  we entered into a loan and share pledge agreement with li wei for the purpose of funding an equity investment of  by li wei in hengda  a company incorporated in the prc which engages in internet access services in the prc on behalf of sohu 
the  investment represents a interest in hengda  with high century holding the remaining interest 
in june  we entered into a loan and share pledge agreement with he jinmei for the purpose of funding an equity investment of  by he jinmei in sohu internet  a company incorporated in the prc which engages in internet information services in the prc on behalf of sohu 
the  investment represents a interest in sohu internet  with high century holding the remaining interest 
the loan agreements under which funds are provided to invest in high century  hengda and sohu internet are subject to prc law and include provisions that i the loans can only be repaid to us by transferring the shares of high century  hengda or sohu internet to us  ii the shares of high century  hengda or sohu internet cannot be transferred without the approval of sohu  and iii we have the right to appoint all directors and senior management personnel of high century  hengda and sohu internet 
charles zhang  li wei and he jinmei have pledged all of their shares in high century  hengda and sohu internet as collateral for the loans and the loans bear no interest and are due on demand after november  in the case of high century  after january  in the case of hengda  and after june  in the case of sohu internet  or at such time as dr 
charles zhang  li wei or he jinmei  as the case may be  is not an employee of sohu 
we do not intend to request repayment of the loans as long as prc regulations prohibit us from directly investing in businesses being undertaken by high century  hengda and sohu internet 
in april  high century invested approximately million in sohu guolian  a company incorporated in the prc  for a equity interest in and joint control of sohu guolian 
sohu guolian provided technical services to the prc online securities trading and financial services industries 
in december  sohu guolian liquidated 
during the year ended december   sohu made a provision of  against the investment in sohu guolian 
each of beijing sohu  high century  hengda  and sohu internet is a vie  as defined under fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  with sohu as the primary beneficiary and consolidated in sohu s financial statements 
sohu adopted the provisions of fin for beijing sohu  high century and hengda as of july  and for sohu internet upon its formation 
b investment in marketable debt securities sohu invests in marketable debt securities to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
these marketable debt securities are classified as available for sale because we may dispose of the securities prior to maturity and they are thus reported at the market value as of the end of the period 
as of december   unrealized gains of  were recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
interest rate risk our investment policy limits our investments of excess cash in high quality corporate securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate debt securities and callable range accrual notes carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while callable range accrual notes may not produce any income if interest rates increase and exceed certain levels 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates
