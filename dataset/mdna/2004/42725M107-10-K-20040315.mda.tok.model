item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
overview we are a fully integrated  self administered and self managed real estate investment trust  or reit 
we are one of the nation s largest owners of neighborhood and community shopping centers 
as of december   we had a shopping center portfolio consisting of shopping centers  located in states and totaling approximately million square feet of gla  of which approximately million square feet was company owned gla 
our shopping center portfolio was approximately leased as of december  our operating strategy is to own and manage a quality portfolio of community and neighborhood shopping centers that will provide stable cash flow and investment returns 
our focus is to own grocer anchored centers with a diverse and multi anchored tenant base in attractive geographic locations with strong demographics 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from rentals and recoveries received from tenants under existing leases on each of our properties 
our operating results therefore depend primarily on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments 
generally  we do not expect that our net operating income will deviate significantly in the short term 
this is because our leases with our tenants provide us a stable cash flow over the long term 
in addition  other than in unusual circumstances such as higher than anticipated snow removal costs  utility expenses or real estate taxes  our operating expenses generally remain predictable 
however  as an owner of community and neighborhood shopping centers  our performance is linked to economic conditions in the retail industry in those markets in which our centers are located 
during the past few years  there has been an economic downturn in the retail industry and in the us economy generally 
in addition  the retail sector has changed dramatically as a result of continued industry consolidation due to the continuing strength of wal mart and large retail bankruptcies resulting in an excess amount of available retail space and greater competition 
we believe that the nature of the properties that we primarily own and invest in grocer anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers provides a more stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  as they are more resistant to economic down cycles 
this is because consumers still need to purchase food and other goods found at grocers  even in difficult economic times 
in the face of these challenging market conditions  we follow a dual growth strategy 
first  we continue to focus on increasing our internal growth by leveraging our existing tenant relationships to improve the performance of our existing shopping center portfolio 
we believe that there are meaningful opportunities to increase our cash flow from our existing properties because of their desirable locations 
for instance  during and  we were adversely affected by large retail bankruptcies that created vacant space within our portfolio and by the increasingly competitive leasing environment resulting from the economic downturn 
as a result  we experienced a decline of approximately in our same store net operating income 
however  as a result of our efforts to re let space recovered from bankrupt tenants  we anticipate modest increases in same store net operating income during the latter part of and into secondly  we focus on achieving external growth by expansion of our portfolio and we will continue to pursue targeted acquisitions of primarily grocer anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers in attractive markets with strong economic and demographic characteristics 
we will pursue acquisitions in our existing markets as well as in new markets where a portfolio of properties might be available to enable us to establish a platform for further growth 
in recent years  the market for acquisitions has been particularly competitive with a greater number of potential buyers pursuing fewer attractive acquisition targets 
the favorable interest rate environment and lower costs of funds have further served to increase dramatically prices paid for shopping center properties 
in the future  to take advantage of these favorable market conditions we may dispose of properties that are not a strategic fit within our overall portfolio 
we currently expect to incur additional debt in connection with any future acquisitions of real estate 
as of december   we had billion of indebtedness 
this indebtedness will require balloon payments starting in august we anticipate that we will not have sufficient funds on hand to repay these balloon amounts at maturity 
therefore  we expect to refinance our debt and to fund our growth either through unsecured private or public debt offerings  additional debt financings secured by individual properties or groups of properties or by additional equity offerings 
we may also finance those payments through borrowings under our line of credit facility 
in the future  we may also pursue joint venture arrangements with third party developers and or institutional investors 
these joint ventures would provide us with greater access to potential acquisitions and alternative sources of capital to fund these acquisitions 
critical accounting policies in response to guidance of the securities and exchange commission  we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  real estate investments and asset impairment  and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risks 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
our estimates are based on information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates and those estimates could be different under varying assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition rental income with scheduled rent increases is recognized using the straight line method over the term of the leases 
the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over cash received under applicable lease provisions is included in accounts receivable 
leases for both retail and office space generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us 
in addition  certain of our operating leases for retail space contain contingent rent provisions under which tenants are required to pay a percentage of their sales in excess of a specified amount as additional rent 
we defer recognition of contingent rental income until those specified targets are met 
we must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable related to minimum rent  deferred rent  expense reimbursements and other revenue or income 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant concentrations  tenant credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our tenant payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income  because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income 
real estate investments at our formation in july  contributed real estate investments were recorded at the carry over basis of our predecessor  which was fair market value of the assets in conformity with gaap applicable to pension funds 
subsequent acquisitions of real estate investments  including those acquired in connection with our acquisition of bradley in september and other acquisitions since our formation  are recorded at cost 
expenditures that substantially extend the useful life of a real estate investment are capitalized 
expenditures for maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not materially extend the useful life of a real estate investment are charged to operations as incurred 
the provision for depreciation and amortization has been calculated using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives land improvements years buildings and improvements years tenant improvements shorter of useful life or term of related lease we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to our properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful life of our properties or improvements  we would depreciate them over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis during these periods 
we apply statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to recognize and measure impairment of long lived assets 
we review each real estate investment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a real estate investment may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges  expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair market value 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
real estate investments held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
depreciation and amortization are suspended during the period held for sale 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income  because taking an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  to property acquisitions 
accordingly  the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets 
management determines the as if vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related costs 
in allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market in place lease values are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets  consisting of in place leases and tenant relationships  is measured by the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in place leases to market rental rates over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant  determined as set forth above 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and tenant relationships  if any  based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease  however  the value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in place lease value for the additional interests in real estate entities because such value and its consequence to amortization expense is estimated to be immaterial for these particular acquisitions 
should future acquisitions of properties result in allocating material amounts to the value of tenant relationships  an amount would be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationship 
the value of in place leases exclusive of the value of above market and below market in place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases 
if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off 
hedging activities from time to time  we use derivative financial instruments to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we were not a party to any hedging agreement with respect to our floating rate debt as of december  or we have in the past used derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings  from lines of credit to medium and long term financings 
we require that hedging derivative instruments are effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designed to hedge 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
if interest rate assumptions and other factors used to estimate a derivative s fair value or methodologies used to determine hedge effectiveness were different  amounts reported in earnings and other comprehensive income and losses expected to be reclassified into earnings in the future could be affected 
furthermore  future changes in market interest rates and other relevant factors could increase the fair value of a liability for a derivative  increase future interest expense  and result in lower net income 
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and from january  through december   we increased our total portfolio of properties from properties to properties and from million company owned gla to million company owned gla 
as a result of this growth of our total portfolio  the financial data presented below with respect to the total portfolio shows significant changes in revenues and expenses from period to period and  as a result  we do not believe our period to period financial data  with respect to the total portfolio are comparable in any meaningful way 
therefore  the comparison of operating results for the years ended december    and show changes resulting from net operating income for properties that we owned for each period compared we refer to this comparison as our same property portfolio for the applicable period and the changes for income before net gains attributable to our total portfolio 
unless otherwise indicated  increases in revenue and expenses attributable to the total portfolio are due to the acquisition of properties during the years being compared 
in addition  amounts classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are excluded from the total portfolio information 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the table below shows selected operating information for our total portfolio and the properties acquired prior to january  that remained in the total portfolio through december   which constitute the same property portfolio for the years ended december  and  in thousands same property portfolio total portfolio increase decrease change increase decrease change rental and recovery revenue rentals      percentage rent     recoveries     other property     total rental and recovery revenue    expenses property operating expenses    real estate taxes    net operating income    add interest and other income deduct depreciation and amortization    interest    general and administrative    loss on prepayment of debt   income before net gains    the increase in rental revenue  including termination fees  for our same property portfolio is primarily the result of new leases and rollovers of existing tenants at higher rental rates and an increase in termination fees of million 
although our actual occupancy on a same property basis declined slightly to as of december  from as of december   this new leasing activity offset any loss of rental income related to i new vacancies and bankruptcies  primarily ames  kmart and fleming and ii additional charges to bad debts of million 
percentage rent revenue decreased for our same property portfolio primarily due to the loss of three anchor tenants with significant percentage rent components comprising million as well as the difference from the prior year timing of notification that sales thresholds have been met 
recoveries revenue remained relatively flat for our same property portfolio primarily due to an overall increase in property operating and real estate tax expenses offset by lower recovery rates resulting from higher vacancies 
recovery rates for recoverable property operating expenses decreased to from and recovery rates for real estate taxes decreased to from 
the decrease in recovery rates for property operating expenses and real estate taxes is due to higher vacancies  including the loss of anchor tenants whose parcels were separately assessed and paid by the former tenants directly to the taxing authority 
other property revenue decreased primarily as a result of the timing of notification that sales thresholds have been met for tax incentive financing revenue 
property operating expenses increased primarily as a result of million of snow removal costs associated with heavy snowfall across the portfolio during the first few calendar months of and december and million of lease buyout expense incurred in real estate tax expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in tax rates across the portfolio  particularly those properties located in illinois as well as additional tax expense related to the vacancy of certain anchor tenants who paid their property taxes directly to the taxing authorities 
interest expense decreased due to lower average interest rates throughout the year as the company s weighted average interest rate decreased to at december  from at december  this decrease was offset by an increase in mortgage loans payable as result of the assumption of debt from various property acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of lower stock compensation expense incurred in than in during  we incurred million of stock compensation expense from the amortization of stock grants made by the company in and and anticipated to be made by the company in  which included the reimbursement of taxes paid by one employee and million of accelerated stock compensation expense in connection with the departure of a former senior officer 
in  we also incurred million of additional compensation expense related to the departure of a former senior officer 
during  we incurred million of stock compensation expense from the amortization of stock grants made by the company  which included the reimbursement of taxes paid by two employees 
included in stock compensation expense was million of expense incurred by us as a result of the accelerated vesting of all previously granted restricted shares upon completion of our ipo 
excluding stock compensation expense and severance costs  our general and administrative expenses  consisting primarily of salaries  bonuses  employee benefits  insurance and other corporate level expenses increased by million in this increase consisted primarily of higher salary and bonus expense due to a larger workforce and higher expenses associated with being a public company for the entire fiscal year 
comparison of the year ended december  to year ended december  the table below shows selected operating information for our total portfolio and the properties acquired prior to january  that remained in our total portfolio through december  which constitute the same property portfolio for the years ended december  and 
certain and amounts for the total portfolio have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation of discontinued operations in thousands same property portfolio total portfolio increase decrease change increase decrease change rental and recovery revenue rentals      percentage rent     recoveries      other property     total rental and recovery revenue    expenses property operating expenses    real estate taxes     net operating income     add interest and other income deduct depreciation and amortization    interest    interest related party   general and administrative    loss on prepayment of debt   income before net gains    the increase in rental revenue  including termination fees  for our same property portfolio is primarily the result of an increase in minimum rent of million related to new leases and rollovers of existing tenants at higher rental rates 
although our actual occupancy on a same property basis remained relatively flat at as of december   the new leasing activity offset any loss of income related to new vacancies and bankruptcies 
additionally  rental revenue increased million due to an additional charge made to bad debts in primarily associated with bankruptcies  principally kmart  and other delinquent tenants 
these increases are partially offset by a reduction in termination fees over the prior year of million in percentage rent revenue increased for our same property portfolio primarily due to the timing of notification that sales thresholds have been met and due to the increased sales performance over the prior sales year for tenants who pay percentage rent 
recoveries revenue increased for our same property portfolio primarily due to an overall increase in the recovery rate of property operating and real estate tax expenses from in to in the increase in the rate is due to recoveries recorded in from bankrupt tenants  primarily kmart  as these leases were not rejected and continued to remain open and operating 
in addition  recoveries revenue increased due to higher reimbursable expenses in the decrease in interest and other income in the total portfolio is primarily due to lower rates and lower average cash balances during property operating expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase of million in repairs and maintenance expense  an increase of in insurance expense  and an increase of million in landscaping expense  partially offset by a decrease in snow removal expense of million due to a mild early snow season 
real estate tax expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in the real estate tax rate for our properties in new york and illinois 
interest expense  including related party interest expense  decreased due to the payoff of certain indebtedness with the proceeds from the ipo  offset by an increase in mortgage loans payable as result of the assumption of debt from various property acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of the effect of accelerated stock compensation expense in connection with the ipo 
upon completion of the ipo  all contractual restrictions on transfer and forfeiture provisions that existed on restricted shares previously granted to members of our senior management and other key employees terminated 
as a result  the company incurred compensation expense  including the reimbursement of taxes paid by two employees  of million  which is comprised of million of stock compensation expense and million for the reimbursement of a portion of such taxes 
in addition  general and administrative expense increased million as a result of compensation expense related to the issuance of  shares of restricted stock in july these shares were subject to contractual restrictions on transfer and forfeiture provisions  which terminated on march  the increase is also due in part to a million increase in the company s supplemental executive retirement plan costs and increased corporate expenses associated with being a public company 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis 
therefore  as a general matter  it is unlikely that we will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs 
instead  these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital 
at december   we had billion of indebtedness 
this indebtedness has a weighted average interest rate of with an average maturity of years 
as of december   our market capitalization was billion  resulting in a debt to total market capitalization ratio of approximately 
short term liquidity requirements our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties  including recurring maintenance capital expenditures necessary to properly maintain our properties  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  capital expenditures incurred to facilitate the leasing of space at our properties  including tenant improvements and leasing commissions  and future distributions paid to our stockholders 
we incur maintenance capital expenditures at our properties  which include such expenses as parking lot improvements  roof repairs and replacements and other non revenue enhancing capital expenditures 
maintenance capital expenditures were approximately million  or per square foot  for the year ended december  we expect total maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately million  or per square foot  for the year ended december  we also expect to incur revenue enhancing capital expenditures such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions in connection with the leasing or re leasing of retail space 
we believe that we qualify and we intend to continue to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code 
as a reit  we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions paid to shareholders 
we believe that our existing working capital and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to allow us to pay distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
however  under some circumstances  we may be required to pay distributions in excess of cash available for those distributions in order to meet these distribution requirements  and we may need to borrow funds to pay distributions in the future 
historically  we have satisfied our short term liquidity requirements through our existing working capital and cash provided by our operations as well as with borrowings under the company s line of credit facility 
we believe that our existing working capital and cash provided by operations should be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
cash flows provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in cash flows from operations is primarily attributable to the combined effect of a million increase in net operating income  primarily as a result of property acquisitions in and  and a million decrease in interest expense  primarily as a result of the repayment of indebtedness from proceeds received from the company s initial public offering 
there are a number of factors that could adversely affect our cash flow 
the continuation of an economic downturn in one or more of our markets may impede the ability of our tenants to make lease payments and may impact our ability to renew leases or re lease space as leases expire 
in addition  an economic downturn or recession could also lead to an increase in tenant bankruptcies  increases in our overall vacancy rates or declines in rents we can charge to re lease properties upon expiration of current leases 
in all of these cases  our cash flow would be adversely affected 
as of december   the company had nine tenants operating under bankruptcy protection  the largest of which is fleming companies fleming 
the leases directly impacted by these bankruptcy filings totaled approximately of our annualized base rent for all leases in which tenants were in occupancy at december  in addition  subsequent to december   four additional tenants  representing of our annualized base rent filed for bankruptcy protection 
on april   fleming filed for bankruptcy protection 
as part of this bankruptcy  fleming s motion to reject leases at three of our fleming store locations was allowed by the bankruptcy court in april the three rejected leases aggregated approximately  square feet and represented approximately of total annualized base rent for all leases in which tenants were in occupancy on march  in june  leases at four of our store locations aggregating  square feet were assumed by fleming and assigned to roundy s  inc  as part of roundy s acquisition of rainbow foods 
in december  a fifth lease was assumed by knowlan s food 
we currently lease space to fleming at five of our other shopping centers 
these five locations  all of which were physically occupied on december   represented approximately of our total annualized base rent for all leases in which tenants were in occupancy on december  fleming has until march  to decide whether or not to reject the remaining leases 
a motion is pending which would allow b r foods to assume three of the five remaining leases and to reject the remaining two leases 
in the event the remaining two leases are rejected  a subtenant occupying one of the stores has entered into an agreement to assume that lease and we are actively pursuing tenants to lease the remaining location 
we are not able to fully predict the impact on our business of fleming s bankruptcy filing at this time 
on january   kmart corporation filed for bankruptcy protection 
at december   we leased space to kmart at seven of our shopping centers 
in addition  kmart owns store locations at four of our shopping centers and subleases space from a third party tenant at one of our other locations 
in connection with its bankruptcy reorganization  the bankruptcy court approved the rejection of leases at three of these twelve store locations 
these store closings totaled approximately  square feet and represented approximately of our total annualized base rent for all leases in which tenants were in occupancy at march  on may   kmart emerged from bankruptcy with no other store closings or lease terminations 
at this time  we do not expect any future impact from kmart s bankruptcy filing 
as a result of our current and past bankrupt tenants  particularly of anchor tenants like fleming and kmart  the company has experienced slight declines in same store net operating income 
any future bankruptcies of tenants in our portfolio  particularly major or anchor tenants  may have additional negative impact on our operating results 
long term liquidity requirements our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our properties  and the costs associated with acquisitions of properties that we pursue 
historically  we have satisfied our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including our existing working capital  cash provided by operations  long term property mortgage indebtedness  our credit facility  bridge financing  and through the issuance of additional equity securities 
we believe that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on our access to these capital sources 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets  our credit rating and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
currently  we have a credit rating from three major rating agencies standard poor s  which has given us a rating of bbb  moody s investor service  which has given us a rating of baa  and fitch  which has given us a rating of bbb  all three have stated the outlook as stable 
a downgrade in outlook or rating by a rating agency can occur at any time if the agency perceives adverse change in our financial condition  results of operations or ability to service our debt 
based on our internal evaluation of our properties  the estimated value of our properties exceeds the outstanding amount of mortgage debt encumbering those properties as of december  therefore  at this time  we believe that additional funds could be obtained  either in the form of mortgage debt or additional unsecured borrowings 
in addition  we believe that we could obtain additional financing without violating the financial covenants contained in our unsecured public notes 
our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities is dependent upon  among other things  general market conditions for reits and market perceptions about us 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but the equity markets may not be consistently available on terms that are attractive or at all 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities all of our indebtedness is disclosed in our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report

the indebtedness described in the table above will require balloon payments  including million starting in august it is likely that we will not have sufficient funds on hand to repay these balloon amounts at maturity 
we currently expect to refinance this debt through unsecured private or public debt offerings  additional debt financings secured by individual properties or groups of properties or additional equity offerings 
we may also refinance balloon payments through borrowings under our unsecured credit facility 
on march   in anticipation of completing an unsecured debt financing during the late first or second quarter of  the company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of  the purpose of these forward swaps is to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates in the near term 
these swaps will have no impact on our current unsecured indebtedness 
these is no assurance that the company will complete an unsecured debt financing during the period in which the interest rate swaps will be in place or at all 
as of december   we have future contractual payment obligations relating to construction contracts  ground leases  and leases for the rental of office space as follows in thousands thereafter total construction contracts tenant improvement obligations  ground leases   office leases       total        we have various existing service contracts with vendors and utility contracts related to our property management 
we enter into these contracts in the ordinary course of business  which vary based on usage and may extend beyond one year 
these contracts are generally for one year or less and include terms that provide for termination with insignificant or no cancellation penalties 
we have obligations under postretirement benefit plans  which are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report  and which are not included in the above table 
funding requirements for postretirement benefits after cannot be estimated due to the significant variability in the assumptions required to project the timing of future cash payments 
line of credit on april   the company entered into a three year million unsecured line of credit with a group of lenders and fleet national bank  as agent 
our two operating partnerships are the borrowers under the line of credit and we  and certain of our other subsidiaries  have guaranteed this line of credit 
this line of credit is being used principally to fund growth opportunities and for working capital purposes 
at december   million was outstanding under the line of credit 
our ability to borrow under this line of credit is subject to our ongoing compliance with a number of financial and other covenants 
this line of credit  except under some circumstances  limits our ability to make distributions in excess of of our annual funds from operations 
in addition  this line of credit bears interest at either the lender s base rate or a floating rate based on a spread over libor ranging from basis points to basis points  depending upon our debt rating 
in addition  this line of credit has a facility fee based on the amount committed ranging from to basis points  depending upon our debt rating  and requires quarterly payments 
the variable rate in effect at december   including the lender s margin of basis points and borrowings outstanding at the base rate was 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under this line of credit 
however  if our properties do not perform as expected  or if unexpected events occur that require us to borrow additional funds  compliance with these covenants may become difficult and may restrict our ability to pursue some business initiatives 
in addition  these financial covenants may restrict our ability to pursue particular acquisition transactions  including for example  acquiring a portfolio of properties that is highly leveraged 
these constraints on acquisitions could significantly impede our growth 
equity financings in april  we completed our initial public offering and sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
we used the net proceeds of the ipo to repay outstanding indebtedness 
in connection with our ipo  all shares of our series a cumulative convertible preferred stock and redeemable equity then outstanding converted automatically into shares of our common stock on a one for one basis 
in december  we completed a secondary public offering of our common stock and sold a total of  shares at a net price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
we used the net proceeds of this offering to repay outstanding indebtedness 
funds from operations we calculate funds from operations in accordance with the best practices described in the april national policy bulletin of the national association of real estate investment trusts  referred to as nareit  and nareit s white paper on funds from operations 
the white paper defines funds from operations as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
we believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors as a measure of our performance as an equity reit because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
our computation of funds from operations may  however  differ from the methodology for calculating funds from operations utilized by other equity reits and  therefore  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the following table reflects the calculation of funds from operations in thousands year ended december  net income    add deduct depreciation and amortization real estate related   net gains on sales of real estate investments and equipment including gain of included in discontinued operations in  preferred stock distributions   accretion of redeemable equity funds from operations    funds from operations for the year ended december  have been restated to exclude the million loss on prepayment of debt  which was previously reported as an extraordinary item  from the reconciliation pursuant to the adoptions of fasb no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  in related party transactions we have in the past engaged in and currently engage in a number of transactions with related parties 
the following is a summary of ongoing transactions with related parties that may significantly impact our future operating results

inflation inflation has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our properties 
however  many of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
these provisions include clauses enabling us to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above pre determined thresholds  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
these escalation clauses often are at fixed rent increases or indexed escalations based on the consumer price index or other measures 
many of our leases are also for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal 
in addition  most of our leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and insurance 
this reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
new accounting standards and accounting changes in december  the financial accounting standards board  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r applies to entities in which the equity investors do not bear the economic risks and rewards of the entity 
an enterprise that is involved with another entity generally must assess whether that involvement requires consolidation under fin r 
public companies must apply fin r immediately to entities created after january  and no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after december  we do not believe the adoption of fin r will have a material impact on the results of our operations  financial position  or liquidity 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
the following table presents our fixed rate debt obligations  at their carrying values  sorted by maturity date and our variable rate debt obligations sorted by maturity date in thousands total estimated fair value weighted average interest rate secured debt fixed rate      variable rate  unsecured debt fixed rate     variable rate   total      we were not a party to any hedging agreements with respect to our floating rate debt as of december  we have in the past used derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings  from lines of credit to medium and long term financings 
we require that hedging derivative instruments be effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designed to hedge 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our floating rate debt is material as of december  in relation to total assets and our total market capitalization
