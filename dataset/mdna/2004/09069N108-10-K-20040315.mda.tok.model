the addition of natural living s foundation of long term local physician relationships and loyal customer base to our position in the new york metropolitan region is an important enhancement of our hiv  oncology and hepatitis c disease categories  as well as a complement to our overall disease state profile 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates  and different assumptions or conditions may yield different estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenue principally through the sale of prescription drugs  which are dispensed either through a pharmacy participating in our pharmacy network or a pharmacy owned by us 
revenue is derived under two types of agreements i fee for service agreements  which accounted for  or million   or million  and or million of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  and ii capitated agreements  which accounted for  or million   or million  and or million of our revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
fee for service agreements 
fee for service agreements include i specialty and mail service agreements  where we dispense prescription medications through our pharmacy facilities and ii pbm agreements  where prescription medications are dispensed through pharmacies participating in our retail pharmacy network as well as through our traditional mail service facility 
under fee for service agreements  revenue is recognized either a when the pharmacy services are reported to us through the point of sale pos claims processing system and the drug is dispensed to the member  in the case of a prescription filled through a pharmacy participating in our retail pharmacy network  or b at the time the drug is dispensed  in the case of a prescription filled through a pharmacy owned by us 
capitated agreements 
our capitated pbm services agreements with plan sponsors require us to provide covered pharmacy services to plan sponsors members in return for a fixed fee per member per month paid by the plan sponsor 
capitated contracts have terms varying from six months to three years 
at such time as management estimates that a contract will sustain losses over its remaining contractual life as a result of increased utilization or changes in product mix  a reserve is established for these estimated losses at that time 
there are currently no expected loss contracts  however  if historical patterns change  we may be required to estimate a loss contract accrual 
our largest capitated contract expired march  and the customer continues to be serviced on a fee for service basis since that time 
we are not actively pursuing new capitated contracts and expect that the amount of revenue derived from such contracts will continue to decline 
we have no capitated specialty management and delivery services agreements 
claims payable we are responsible for all covered prescriptions provided to plan members during the contract period 
claims are continuously adjudicated through our on line adjudication system 
these claims are paid to the individual pharmacies on a weekly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
the procedure for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment and assumptions 
our primary collection risks are for patient co payments and deductibles 
the risk of collection varies based upon the product  the payor and the patient s ability to pay the amounts not reimbursed by the payor 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a variety of factors including the age of the outstanding receivables and our historical experience of collections  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
we continually review the estimation process and make changes to the estimates as necessary 
allowance for contractual discounts we are reimbursed for the drugs and services we sell by many different payors including insurance companies  medicare and state medicaid programs 
the revenues and related accounts receivable are recorded net of payor contractual discounts to reflect the estimated net billable amounts for the products and services delivered 
we estimate the allowance for contractual discounts  based on historical experience and in certain cases on a customer specific basis  given our interpretation of the contract terms or applicable regulations 
however  the reimbursement rates are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
additionally  updated regulations and contract negotiations occur frequently  necessitating our continual review and assessment of the estimation process 
rebates manufacturers rebates are recorded as estimates until such time as the rebate monies are received 
these estimates are based on historical results and trends and are revised on a regular basis depending on our latest forecasts 
should actual results differ  adjustments will be recorded in future earnings 
in some instances rebate payments are shared with the company s managed care organizations 
shared rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
total rebates are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
purchase price allocation we account for acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  any assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values 
the recorded values of assets and liabilities are based on third party estimates and independent valuations 
the remaining values are based on management s judgments and estimates 
accordingly  our financial position or results of operations may be affected by changes in estimates and judgments 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is uncertain whether we will be able to realize the benefit from its deferred tax assets 
net deferred income tax assets increased million in the valuation allowance for the deferred income tax asset decreased million in management concluded that the valuation allowance was no longer needed and the tax asset will more likely than not be realized based on our strong earnings history for the past three years and other positive factors 
hence  the total valuation allowance related to our net operating loss carryforwards generated from stock exercises was reversed 
the reversal did not affect net income or the effective tax rate 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets  including intangible assets  may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of an asset may not be recoverable 
the measurement of possible impairment is based on the ability to recover the balance of assets from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
impairment losses  if any  would be determined based on the present value of the cash flows using discount rates that reflect the inherent risk of the underlying business 
it is management s belief that no such impairment existed as of december  effective on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement addresses the accounting and reporting of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
since adoption of sfas no 
in july  amortization of goodwill has discontinued  and goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is necessary to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we have two reporting units and both of the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts resulting in no impairment charges in fiscal year indefinite lived intangible under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform an annual impairment test for its indefinite lived intangible ie  tradename which is recorded at million at december  the impairment step is a one step process where the fair value is compared to the carrying value at least annually 
if the estimated fair value is lower than the carrying value  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
the determination of fair value of this intangible asset requires management to use estimate and assumption of the future cash flows and discount rates 
changes to these assumptions could affect the estimated fair value 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of the intangible that is carried at million at december  such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material negative change in our relationships with significant customers 
accounting for stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  no compensation expense is recorded for employee stock based awards issued at market value at the date such awards are granted 
stock based compensation granted to non employees is accounted for using the fair value method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation

the overall increase was due to continued growth in our injectable and infusion therapy programs  such as immune deficiency  hepatitis c  rheumatoid arthritis  multiple sclerosis and growth hormone therapies 
cost of revenue increased million to million in  compared to in gross profit declined million to million for the year ended december  gross profit percentage declined to in compared to in  as a result of increased revenue in lower margin injectable therapy programs as well as decreased revenues and margin erosion at the long island  ny distribution center

year ended december  vs 
year ended december  pbm services revenue decreased million to million in compared to revenue of million in  due to the loss of tenncare pbm business in the third quarter of the decrease was partially offset by growth in mail revenue and other existing pbm contracts

year ended december  vs 
year ended december  pbm services revenues decreased million to million in compared to million in in the second quarter of we changed the terms of some of our pbm contracts so that we no longer accepted financial or credit risk for these customers 
as a result  we began recording revenue from these customers on a net basis where previously it was recorded on a gross basis 
this change reduced revenue and cost of revenue by million for the twelve months ended december   with no resulting effect on gross profit 
revenue was also reduced in as a result of the termination of certain less profitable pbm clients and the liquidation of access medplus in the fourth quarter of these decreases were partially offset by increases in our retail network and mail service contracts 
pbm services cost of revenue increased slightly to million in from million in this change is a result of the same reasons discussed above 
the pbm services gross profit for the pbm services segment decreased million to million in compared to million in this is a result of the liquidation of a former tenncare mco customer and the termination of certain less profitable pbm accounts

we did not pay bonus compensation for as certain internal financial metrics were not met 
bonus compensation for was million 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million compared to million in this increase is principally the result of the inclusion of the long island  ny distribution center business since february  additional expenses incurred to support the growth of our businesses and higher insurance premiums 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in tenncare reserve adjustments there were no tenncare reserve adjustments during the tenncare reserve adjustment of million in the first quarter of was the result of the collection of previously reserved receivables from xantus healthplans of tennessee  inc in  we recorded million of tenncare reserve adjustments for estimated losses on contract receivables relating to tennessee health partnership thp  preferred health plans and xantus health plans of tennessee  inc xantus 
in  we recorded a reserve adjustment credit of million to reflect a favorable settlement with thp relative to the amount initially reserved in there were no reserve adjustments in in addition  in and  we recorded reserve adjustment credits of million and million  respectively  as a result of the collection of receivables from xantus previously reserved for in amortization of intangibles for  we recorded amortization of intangibles of million  versus million in the increase was primarily the result of a change in the estimated amortizable period of certain identifiable intangibles related to the long island  ny distribution center

the expected amortizable life of these assets range from three to ten years 
in and the company recorded amortization of intangibles of million and million  respectively

liqcontractual gif 
on february   we acquired natural living  inc for million cash 
this purchase was financed using the facility 
other matters on march  we reached a tentative settlement with e 
david corvese  the founder and a former officer and director of the company under which we would pay mr 
corvese  and either extend the term of our existing lease or purchase the real property at which one of our facilities is located  the value of which would be determined by a certified real estate appraiser 
mr 
corvese had sued us in delaware chancery court seeking indemnification of million he paid to settle certain claims and charges of the federal government and state of tennessee and a declaration that he is not obligated to repay the company for legal fees  costs and expenses previously advanced by us to him to defend those claims and charges 
we answered the complaint denying that mr 
corvese is entitled to indemnification and seeking repayment of the advanced fees  costs and expenses 
however  after considering the substantial costs of proceeding with this litigation and the significant management time and attention that would be required  we believe that a settlement at this time would be in the company s and its stockholders best interest 
the settlement was reached after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements 
accordingly  we recorded a pre tax charge of  at december  we believe that we have rights of recovery for amounts paid in this settlement against third parties 
we are exploring our rights against these parties and will pursue recovery if it is ultimately deemed to be in the stockholders best interests 
the settlement is subject to documentation and approval by the company s board and  if finalized  would include both parties full release of the other 
in  we recorded a million charge against earnings as a result of an agreement in principle with respect to a civil settlement of a federal and state of tennessee investigation in connection with conduct occurring prior to our august initial public offering involving  among others  two former officers of the company 
the definitive agreement covering that settlement was executed on june   and required payment of million in  million in  and million in on march   mr 
richard friedman  our chairman and chief executive officer  repaid in full a million loan from the company 
this loan  together with accrued and unpaid interest  totaled approximately million 
on february   we announced our acquisition of natural living  inc  a specialty pharmaceutical provider  based in new york city for million 
we believe that natural living s foundation of long term local physician relationships and loyal customer base in the new york metropolitan region will further enhance our hiv  oncology and hepatitis c disease categories  while complementing our overall disease state profile 
natural living s annual revenues were approximately million and the acquisition is expected to be slightly accretive to our earnings per share in natural living will be consolidated starting in february  and the purchase price allocation is not yet complete 
regulatory matters on april   the us department of health and human services  office of inspector general oig released compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers the guidance designed to provide voluntary  nonbinding guidance to assist companies that develop  manufacture  market and sell pharmaceutical products or biological products  including pbm s in devising effective compliance programs 
the guidance provides the oig s view of the fundamental elements of pharmaceutical manufacturer s compliance programs and principles that should be considered when creating and implementing an effective compliance program  or as a benchmark for companies with existing compliance programs 
we currently maintain a compliance program that includes the key compliance program elements described in the guidance 
we believe that the fundamental elements of our compliance program are consistent with the principles  policies and intent of the guidance 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
in fiscal year did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables related to the timing of revenue recognition for arrangements in which goods or services or both are delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement 
the consensus requires that when the deliverables included in this type of arrangement meet certain criteria they should be accounted for separately 
this may result in a difference in the timing of revenue recognition but will not result in a change in the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the arrangement 
the allocation of revenue to the separate deliverables is based on the relative fair value of each item in a bundled sales arrangement 
if the fair value is not available for the delivered items  the residual method must be used 
this method requires that the amount allocated for the undelivered items in the arrangement be recorded at their full fair value 
this results in the discount  if any  being allocated to the delivered items 
this consensus is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly and clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  and must be applied prospectively 
the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
in fiscal year did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  and must be applied prospectively by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations since we do not currently have any financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt 
at december  we did not have any long term debt 
the company does not invest in  or otherwise use  derivative financial instruments 
at december   the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  claims payable  payables to plan sponsors and others  and debt approximate fair value due to their short term nature 
because we do not believe that out exposure to interest rate market risk is material at this time  we have not developed or implemented a strategy to manage this market risk through the use of derivative financial instruments or otherwise 
we will assess the significance of interest rate market risk from time to time and will develop and implement strategies to manage that risk as appropriate
