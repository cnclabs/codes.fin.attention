general following is a discussion and analysis of the financial statements and other statistical data that management believes will enhance the understanding of afg s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page f overview financial condition afg strengthened its capital and liquidity during with shareholders equity growing by more than million to billion 
nearly half of this increase resulted from the elimination of a deferred tax liability following the merger of afg and two subsidiary holding companies in november 
in the merger  afg issued million common shares to retire all million of voting preferred stock of the subsidiary holding company  american financial corporation  thereby reducing annual dividends by over million 
afg and its subsidiaries completed several major cash transactions in  including the following afg received million on the february initial public offering of of infinity property and casualty  a former subsidiary engaged primarily in nonstandard automobile insurance 
afg received million in july from infinity s repayment of a note 
afg sold its remaining interest in infinity for million in december 
afg issued over million in public debt in and repaid nearly million in bank debt during the year 
in addition  afg and its subsidiaries issued just over million in debt during the first quarter of and used the proceeds primarily to retire higher coupon trust preferred securities 
results of operations through the operations of its subsidiaries  afg is engaged primarily in property and casualty insurance and in the sale of retirement annuities  life and supplemental health insurance products 
with the sale of infinity  afg narrowed the focus of its property and casualty business to its specialized commercial products for businesses 
the property and casualty business is cyclical in nature with periods of high competition resulting in low premium rates  sometimes referred to as a soft market or downcycle followed by periods of reduced competition and higher premium rates  referred to as a hard market or upcycle 
the s were a soft market period  prices started to harden in and accelerated significantly following the terrorist attacks in rates have continued to rise into  although the increases have moderated somewhat during the latter part of as discussed in the following pages under results of operations  the profitability of afg s property and casualty business improved during the hard market despite the negative impact of adverse development on prior year claims and lower yields on newly invested funds 
the operating results of afg s annuity  life and health business were negatively impacted in by the continued narrowing of spreads in its fixed annuity operations 
this spread narrowing was partially offset by improved results in the other annuity  life and health operations 
afg s net earnings for were million per share 
included in net earnings were the following items  net of tax and minority interest tax benefits of million related primarily to the elimination of deferred tax reserves in connection with the merger of parent company subsidiaries 
net realized gains of million on the sale of securities  subsidiaries and investees 
charge of million for an arbitration decision relating to a property insurance claim 
litigation charge of million for a settlement within the california workers compensation insurance business 
impairment provision of million included in discontinued operations related to the planned disposal of an inactive property and casualty subsidiary with approximately one eighth of afg s total asbestos and environmental liabilities 
critical accounting policies significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on amounts reported in the financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change and thus impact amounts reported in the future 
management believes that the establishment of insurance reserves  especially asbestos and environmental related reserves  and the determination of other than temporary impairment on investments are the two areas where the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements make the accounting policies critical 
for further discussion of these policies  see liquidity and capital resources investments and liquidity and capital resources uncertainties 
liquidity and capital resources ratios afg s debt to total capital ratio at the parent holding company level was approximately at december   compared to at december  afg s ratio of earnings to fixed charges  including annuity benefits as a fixed charge  was for the year ended december  excluding annuity benefits  this ratio was for although the ratio excluding interest on annuities is not required or encouraged to be disclosed under securities and exchange commission rules  it is presented because interest credited to annuity policyholder accounts is not always considered a borrowing cost for an insurance company 
the naic s model law for risk based capital rbc applies to both life and property and casualty companies 
rbc formulas determine the amount of capital that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
at december   the capital ratios of all afg insurance companies substantially exceeded the rbc requirements the lowest capital ratio of any operating afg subsidiary was times its authorized control level rbc  weighted average of all afg subsidiaries was times 
sources of funds afg is organized as a holding company with almost all of its operations being conducted by subsidiaries 
afg  however  has continuing cash needs for administrative expenses  the payment of principal and interest on borrowings  shareholder dividends  and taxes 
funds to meet these obligations come primarily from dividend and tax payments from its subsidiaries 
management believes afg has sufficient resources to meet its liquidity requirements 
if funds generated from operations  including dividends and tax payments from subsidiaries  are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period  afg would be required to generate cash through borrowings  sales of securities or other assets  or similar transactions 
afg s bank credit line consists of two facilities a day revolving facility  extendable annually  for one third of the total line and a three year revolving facility for the remaining two thirds 
amounts borrowed bear interest at rates ranging from to over libor based on afg s credit rating 
this credit agreement provides ample liquidity and can be used to obtain funds for operating subsidiaries or  if necessary  for the parent companies 
about half of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior convertible notes in june were used to repay borrowings under afc s bank line 
while the credit line provides up to million of availability  there were no borrowings outstanding at december  all debentures issued by afg and gafri are rated investment grade by three nationally recognized rating agencies 
in february  afg issued million in debentures due under a shelf registration statement and called for redemption million in trust preferred securities 
under a currently effective shelf registration statement  afg can issue up to an aggregate of million in additional equity or debt securities 
the shelf registration provides afg with greater flexibility to access the capital markets from time to time as market and other conditions permit 
for statutory accounting purposes  equity securities of non affiliates are generally carried at market value 
at december   afg s insurance companies owned publicly traded equity securities with a market value of million 
in addition  great american insurance company owns gafri common stock with a market value of million and a statutory carrying value of million 
decreases in market prices could adversely affect the insurance group s capital  potentially impacting the amount of dividends available or necessitating a capital contribution 
conversely  increases in market prices could have a favorable impact on the group s dividend paying capability 
under tax allocation agreements with afg  its owned us subsidiaries generally compute tax provisions as if filing separate returns based on book taxable income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the resulting provision or credit is currently payable to or receivable from afg 
contractual obligations at december   afg s material contractual obligations in the next five years and for all years thereafter detailed by type of obligation were as follows in millions within more than contractual obligations total one year years years years long term debt payable to subsidiary trusts operating leases total the afg convertible debentures issued in are included in the above table at the first put date 
afg s balance sheet at december   includes estimated liabilities for claims and benefits payable related to its insurance operations 
afg expects operating cash flows to be sufficient to meet these obligations and also have marketable investments available for sale should the operating cash flows prove to be inadequate 
afg has no material contractual purchase obligations or other long term liabilities at december  investments approximately two thirds of afg s consolidated assets are invested in marketable securities 
afg s investment portfolio at december   contained billion in fixed maturities classified as available for sale and million in other stocks  all carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity on an after tax basis 
at december   afg had pretax net unrealized gains of million on fixed maturities and million on other stocks 
afg attempts to optimize investment income while building the value of its portfolio  placing emphasis upon long term performance 
afg s goal is to maximize return on an ongoing basis rather than focusing on short term performance 
fixed income investment funds are generally invested in securities with intermediate term maturities with an objective of optimizing total return while allowing flexibility to react to changes in market conditions 
at december   the average life of afg s fixed maturities was about years 
approximately of the fixed maturities held by afg were rated investment grade credit rating of aaa to bbb by nationally recognized rating agencies at december  investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated or noninvestment grade 
management believes that the high quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return 
investments in mortgage backed securities mbss represented approximately one fourth of afg s fixed maturities at december  mbss are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that  in periods of declining interest rates  mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates 
due to the significant decline in the general level of interest rates in and  afg has experienced an increase in the level of prepayments on its mbss  these prepayments have not been reinvested at interest rates comparable to the rates earned on the prepaid mbss 
substantially all of afg s mbss are investment grade quality  with over rated aaa at december  summarized information for the unrealized gains and losses recorded in afg s balance sheet at december   is shown in the following table dollars in millions 
approximately million of available for sale fixed maturities and million of other stocks had no unrealized gains or losses at december  securities securities with with unrealized unrealized gains losses available for sale fixed maturities market value of securities amortized cost of securities gross unrealized gain loss market value as of amortized cost number of security positions number individually exceeding million gain or loss concentration of gains losses by type or industry exceeding of unrealized gas and electric services banks  savings and credit institutions mortgage backed securities state and municipal telephone communications us government and government agencies air transportation generally collateralized percentage rated investment grade other stocks market value of securities cost of securities gross unrealized gain loss market value as of cost number individually exceeding million gain or loss afg s investment in equity securities of provident financial group  a cincinnati based commercial banking and financial services company  represents million of the million in unrealized gains on other stocks at december  the table below sets forth the scheduled maturities of afg s available for sale fixed maturity securities at december   based on their market values 
asset backed securities and other securities with sinking funds are reported at average maturity 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain securities may be called or prepaid by the issuers 
securities securities with with unrealized unrealized maturity gains losses one year or less after one year through five years after five years through ten years after ten years mortgage backed securities afg realized aggregate losses of million during on million in sales of fixed maturity securities issues  issuers that had individual unrealized losses greater than  at december  market values of seven of the issues increased an aggregate of million from year end to date of sale 
the market value of the remaining two securities decreased  from year end to the sale date 
afg realized aggregate losses of million during on million in sales of fixed maturity securities issues  issuers that had individual unrealized losses greater than  at december  market values of eleven of the securities increased an aggregate of million from year end to date of sale 
the market value of one of the securities did not change from year end to the date of sale 
one of the securities was a conseco bond that decreased in value by million from year end to the date of sale due to the continued decline in conseco s financial condition 
the market value of the remaining security decreased  from year end to the sale date 
although afg had the ability to continue holding these investments  its intent to hold them changed due primarily to deterioration in the issuers creditworthiness  decisions to lessen exposure to a particular credit or industry  or to modify asset allocation within the portfolio 
the table below dollars in millions summarizes the unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities by dollar amount 
market aggregate aggregate value as market unrealized of cost value gain loss basis fixed maturities securities with unrealized gains exceeding  issues less than   issues securities with unrealized losses exceeding  issues less than  issues the following table summarizes dollars in millions the unrealized loss for all fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses by issuer quality and length of time those securities have been in an unrealized loss position 
market aggregate aggregate value as market unrealized of cost value gain loss basis fixed maturities with unrealized losses at december  investment grade with losses for one year or less issues greater than one year issues non investment grade with losses for one year or less issues greater than one year issues when a decline in the value of a specific investment is considered to be other than temporary  a provision for impairment is charged to earnings accounted for as a realized loss and the cost basis of that investment is reduced 
the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
factors considered and resources used by management include a 
whether the unrealized loss is credit driven or a result of changes in market interest rates  b 
the extent to which market value is less than cost basis  c

ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
based on its analysis of the factors enumerated above  management believes i afg will recover its cost basis in the securities with unrealized losses and ii that afg has the ability and intent to hold the securities until they mature or recover in value 
should either of these beliefs change with regard to a particular security  a charge for impairment would likely be required 
while it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired  charges for other than temporary impairment could be material to results of operations in a future period 
management believes it is not likely that future impairment charges will have a significant effect on afg s liquidity 
net realized gains losses on securities sold and charges for other than temporary impairment on securities held were as follows in millions net realized gains losses charges for on sales impairment other a total b a 
includes adjustments to carry derivatives at market and to reflect the impact of realized gains and losses on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
b 
does not include million writedown of certain collateralized debt obligations which was recorded as the cumulative effect of an adoption of an accounting change at april  increased impairment charges in recent years reflect a rise in corporate defaults in the marketplace resulting from the weakened economy and other factors 
uncertainties as more fully explained in the following paragraphs  management believes that the areas posing the greatest risk of material loss are the adequacy of its insurance reserves and american premier s contingencies arising out of its former operations 
property and casualty insurance reserves the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae was as follows in millions december  specialty personal other lines including asbestos and environmental the liabilities for unpaid claims and for expenses of investigation and adjustment of unpaid claims are based upon a the accumulation of case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting periods on direct business written  b estimates received from ceding reinsurers and insurance pools and associations  c estimates of unreported losses based on past experience  d estimates based on experience of expense for investigating and adjusting claims  and e the current state of law and coverage litigation 
using these items as well as historical trends adjusted for changes in underwriting standards  policy provisions  product mix and other factors  company actuaries determine a single or point estimate which management utilizes in recording its best estimate of the liabilities 
ranges of loss reserves are not developed by company actuaries 
estimating the liability for unpaid losses and lae is inherently judgmental and is influenced by factors which are subject to significant variation 
through the use of analytical reserve development techniques  management utilizes items such as the effect of inflation on medical  hospitalization  material  repair and replacement costs  general economic trends and the legal environment 
while current factors and reasonably likely changes in variable factors are considered in estimating the liability for unpaid losses  there is no method or system which can eliminate the risk of actual ultimate results differing from such estimates 
as shown in the reserve development table loss triangle on page  the original estimates of afg s liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of reinsurance  over the past years have developed through december   to be deficient for three years by as much as and redundant for years by as much as excluding the effect of special charges for asbestos and environmental exposures 
afg believes this development illustrates the variability in factors considered in estimating its insurance reserves 
quarterly reviews of unpaid loss and lae reserves are prepared using standard actuarial techniques 
these may include case incurred development method  paid development method  bornhuetter ferguson method  and incremental paid lae to paid loss methods 
generally  data is segmented by major product or coverage within product using countrywide data  however  in some situations data may be reviewed by state or region 
asbestos and environmental related a e reserves establishing reserves for a e claims relating to policies and participations in reinsurance treaties and former operations is subject to uncertainties that are significantly greater than those presented by other types of claims 
for this group of claims  traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical loss development trends cannot be used and a meaningful range of loss cannot be estimated 
case reserves and expense reserves are established by the claims department as specific policies are identified 
in addition to the case reserves established for known claims  management establishes additional reserves for claims not yet known or reported and for possible development on known claims 
these additional reserves are management s best estimate based on its review of industry trends and other industry information about such claims  with d ue consideration to individual claim situations like ap green 
estimating ultimate liability for asbestos claims presents a unique and difficult challenge to the insurance industry due to  among other things  inconsistent court decisions  an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos related liabilities  novel theories of coverage  and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage 
the casualty insurance industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues as the volume and severity of claims against asbestos defendants continue to increase 
while management believes that afg s reserves for a e claims are a reasonable estimate of ultimate liability for such claims  actual results may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded due to the difficulty in predicting the number of future claims and the impact of recent bankruptcy filings  and unresolved issues such as whether coverage exists  whether policies are subject to aggregate limits on coverage  whether claims are to be allocated among triggered policies and implicated years  and whether claimants who exhibit no signs of illness will be successful in pursuing their claims 
in february  great american insurance company entered into an agreement for the settlement of asbestos related coverage litigation under insurance polices issued during the s and s to bigelow liptak corporation and related companies  subsequently known as ap green industries  inc management believes that this settlement will enhance financial certainty and provides resolution to litigation that represents afg s largest known asbestos related claim and the only such claim that management believes to be material 
the settlement is for million great american has the option to pay in cash or over time with interest  all but million of which was covered by reserves established prior to september   and anticipated reinsurance recoverables for this matter 
as a result  afg recorded a million pretax charge million after tax in the fourth quarter of the agreement allows up to of the settlement to be paid in afg common stock 
the settlement has received the approval of the bankruptcy court supervising the reorganization of ap green 
it remains subject to the confirmation by the bankruptcy court of a plan of reorganization that includes an injunction prohibiting the assertion against great american of any present or future asbestos personal injury claims under policies issued to ap green and related companies 
this process should be completed in no assurance can be made that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed  no payments are required until completion of the process 
if there is no plan confirmation  the outcome of this litigation will again be subject to the complexities and uncertainties associated with a chapter proceeding and asbestos coverage litigation 
the payments and reserve balances for asbestos  environmental and other mass torts were as follows in millions net net amounts reserve paid in balance asbestos environmental other mass tort total nearly one half of afg s asbestos reserves relate to policies written by afg subsidiaries 
claims from these policies generally are product oriented claims with only a limited amount of non product exposures  and are dominated by small to mid sized commercial entities that are mostly regional policyholders with few national target defendants 
the assumed reinsurance business includes exposures for the periods to the asbestos and environmental assumed claims are ceded by various insurance companies under reinsurance treaties 
a majority of the individual assumed claims have exposures of less than  to afg 
asbestos losses assumed include some of the industry known manufacturers  distributors and installers 
pollution losses include industry known insured names and sites 
other mass tort losses include lead  silica and various chemical exposures 
exposure to market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
afg s exposures to market risk relate primarily to its investment portfolio and annuity contracts which are exposed to interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  equity price risk 
to a much lesser extent  afg s long term debt is also exposed to interest rate risk 
fixed maturity portfolio the fair value of afg s fixed maturity portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates 
afg s fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of substantially all fixed rate investments with primarily intermediate term maturities 
this practice allows flexibility in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
the portfolios of afg s insurance operations are managed with an attempt to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 
afg s life and annuity operations attempt to align the duration of their invested assets to the projected cash flows of policyholder liabilities 
the following table provides information about afg s available for sale fixed maturity investments at december  and  that are sensitive to interest rate risk 
the table shows principal cash flows in millions and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for each of the five subsequent years and for all years thereafter 
callable bonds and notes are included based on call date or maturity date depending upon which date produces the most conservative yield 
mortgage backed securities mbss and sinking fund issues are included based on maturity year adjusted for expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows may differ from those expected 
december  december  principal principal cash flows rate cash flows rate thereafter thereafter total fair value equity price risk equity price risk is the potential economic loss from adverse changes in equity security prices 
although afg s investment in other stocks is less than of total investments  one half of other stocks is invested in provident financial group 
in february  provident announced that it is being acquired by national city corporation  one of the nation s largest banks 
if this transaction is completed  afg will receive million shares approximately of national city in exchange for its investment in provident 
annuity contracts substantially all of gafri s fixed rate annuity contracts permit gafri to change crediting rates subject to minimum interest rate guarantees of to per annum as determined by applicable law enabling management to react to changes in market interest rates 
nonetheless  due to the drop in interest rates  gafri s spreads have narrowed and will likely continue to narrow through at least in the fourth quarter of  gafri began to issue a portion of new business using a minimum interest guarantee of less than in states where required approvals have been received 
actuarial assumptions used to estimate dpac and annuity benefits  as well as gafri s ability to maintain spread  could be impacted if the current interest rate environment continues for an extended period and causes policyholder behavior to be altered 
projected payments in millions in each of the subsequent five years and for all years thereafter on gafri s fixed annuity liabilities at december were as follows 
fair first second third fourth fifth thereafter total value approximately half of gafri s fixed annuity liabilities at december   were two tier in nature in that policyholders can receive a higher amount if they annuitize rather than surrender their policy  even if the surrender charge period has expired 
at december   the average stated crediting rate on the inforce block of gafri s principal fixed annuity products was approximately 
the current stated crediting rates excluding bonus interest on new sales of gafri s products generally range from to 
gafri estimates that its effective weighted average crediting rate on its inforce business over the next five years will approximate 
this rate reflects actuarial assumptions as to i expected investment spread  ii deaths  iii annuitizations  iv surrenders and v renewal premiums 
actual experience and changes in actuarial assumptions may result in different effective crediting rates than those above 
gafri s equity indexed fixed annuities provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied  in part  to the performance of an existing stock market index 
gafri attempts to mitigate the risk in the equity based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index 
gafri s strategy is designed so that an increase in the liabilities  due to an increase in the market index  will be substantially offset by unrealized and realized gains on the call options purchased by gafri 
under sfas no 
 both the equity based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives and marked to market through current earnings as annuity benefits 
adjusting these derivatives to market value had a net effect of less than of annuity benefits in and in  gafri chose to suspend new sales of equity indexed annuities due primarily to lack of volume 
debt and preferred securities the following table shows scheduled principal payments in millions on fixed rate long term debt of afg and its subsidiaries and related weighted average interest rates for each of the subsequent five years and for all years thereafter 
december  december  scheduled scheduled principal principal payments rate payments rate thereafter thereafter total fair value less than million 
the afg convertible debentures issued in are included in the above table at the first put date 
in december  gafri entered into an interest rate swap  effectively converting million of its fixed rate notes due in included in the table above to a floating rate about at december  
at december   afg and gafri had a total of million outstanding under their variable rate bank lines weighted average interest rate at december  
no amounts were borrowed under the bank lines at december  there were million and million of subsidiary trust preferred securities with a weighted average interest rate of and outstanding at december  and  respectively 
although none of these are scheduled for maturity or mandatory redemption during the next five years  approximately million were redeemed in the first quarter of under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  which afg implemented as of december   afg was required to deconsolidate the wholly owned subsidiary trusts that issued these securities because they are variable interest entities in which afg is not considered to be the primary beneficiary 
these subsidiary trusts were formed to issue the preferred securities and  in turn  purchase a like amount of subordinated debt from their parent company  which provides interest and principal payments to fund the respective trust obligations 
accordingly  at december   the subordinated debt due the trusts is shown as a liability in the balance sheet 
prior to that date  the subsidiary trust preferred securities were included in minority interest in the balance sheet 
results of operations three years ended december  general the following table shows afg s net earnings and diluted earnings per share as stated in the statement of operations as well as the after tax effect of other items included in these gaap measures that are listed below to assist investors in analyzing their impact on the trend in operating results in millions  except per share amounts net earnings loss after tax income expense items included in net earnings arbitration settlement litigation settlements special tax benefits a e charge and wtc losses net earnings losses from investee corporations realized investment gains losses discontinued operations cumulative effect of accounting changes diluted per share amounts net earnings loss arbitration settlement litigation settlements special tax benefits a e charge and wtc losses investee corporations realized investment gains losses discontinued operations cumulative effect of accounting changes in addition to the effects of items shown in the table above  net earnings increased in as improved underwriting results more than offset a decline in the fixed annuity operations 
net earnings increased in primarily due to significantly improved underwriting results and income from the sale of real estate  partially offset by reduced earnings in the annuity and life operations

property and casualty insurance underwriting afg s property and casualty group has consisted of two major business groups specialty and personal 
see note b  acquisitions and sales of subsidiaries  to the financial statements for a discussion of the sale of nearly all of the personal group 
the specialty group includes a highly diversified group of business lines 
some of the more significant areas are inland and ocean marine  california workers compensation  agricultural related coverages  executive and professional liability  fidelity and surety bonds  commercial auto  collateral protection  umbrella  and excess and surplus coverages 
the personal group wrote nonstandard and preferred standard private passenger auto insurance and  to a lesser extent  homeowners insurance 
nonstandard automobile insurance covers risks not typically accepted for standard automobile coverage because of the applicant s driving record  type of vehicle  age or other criteria 
to understand the overall profitability of particular lines  the timing of claims payments and the related impact of investment income must be considered 
certain short tail lines of business primarily property coverages have quick loss payouts which reduce the time funds are held  thereby limiting investment income earned thereon 
on the other hand  long tail lines of business primarily liability coverages and workers compensation have payouts that are either structured over many years or take many years to settle  thereby significantly increasing investment income earned on related premiums received 
underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio which is a sum of the ratios of underwriting losses  loss adjustment expenses  underwriting expenses and policyholder dividends to premiums 
when the combined ratio is under  underwriting results are generally considered profitable  when the ratio is over  underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable 
the combined ratio does not reflect investment income  other income or federal income taxes 
for certain lines of business and products where the credibility of the range of loss estimates is less certain primarily many of the various specialty businesses listed above  management believes that it is prudent and appropriate to use conservative assumptions until such time as the data  experience and projections have more credibility  as evidenced by data volume  consistency and maturity of the data 
while this practice mitigates the risk of adverse development on this business  it does not eliminate it 
while afg desires and seeks to earn an underwriting profit on all of its business  it is not always possible to do so 
as a result  afg attempts to expand in the most profitable areas and control growth or even reduce its involvement in the least profitable ones 
over the last several years  afg has been realigning its property and casualty business mix and focusing on rate adequacy in order to improve its operating profitability 
management has continued to direct capital in order to take advantage of certain specialty market opportunities 
management believes these actions have been successful and that the current mix of specialty businesses positions the company for solid growth and continuing improved profitability in the foreseeable future 
afg s combined ratio has been better than the industry average for seventeen of the last eighteen years and excluding afg s special a e charges  for all eighteen years 
management believes that afg s insurance operations have performed better than the industry as a result of product line diversification and stringent underwriting discipline

major areas of adverse development were as follows in millions property and transportation specialty casualty personal lines arbitration settlement asbestos other amounts are immaterial and included in other 
the prior year development in property and transportation related primarily to higher than anticipated frequency of claims in the through accident years for the homebuilders liability business  which is in runoff 
specialty casualty development includes amounts related to executive liability  other liability and excess casualty runoff 
executive liability development impacted  and and resulted primarily from claim severity on directors and officers liability policy coverages for through both settlement and defense costs related to shareholder lawsuits have increased beyond estimates 
the development in other liability impacted both and reflecting an unexpected shift of judicial climate in some previously conservative states 
verdicts  judgments  and settlements have increased 
the development in excess casualty runoff during reflects higher frequency of claims related to the and accident years 
excess casualty runoff development in  and to a lesser extent in  was affected by increased severity resulting from a rigorous claims review of case reserves established by former management 
in the personal lines  personal injury and uninsured motorist claims experienced increased severity 
during  claims remained open longer and settlement amounts were higher than in previous years 
the arbitration settlement represents a charge in the second quarter of for an unfavorable decision resulting from great american s share of a property fire and business interruption claim 
great american was a participant with a number of other companies in the insurance pool that insured the loss during the coverage year 
asbestos development was due primarily to a charge of million for the settlement of asbestos related coverage in litigation in and the special million a e charge in  which is discussed below 
see uncertainties asbestos and environmental related reserves for additional information about these claims 
special a e charge during the third quarter of  afg recorded an a e charge of million after experiencing an increase in the number and severity of asbestos claims and observing the developments of adverse trends in the property and casualty insurance industry concerning asbestos losses 
of this charge  million was recorded by transport insurance company  which has been reclassified to discontinued operations 
this charge  accompanied by a transfer of million from excess reserves for other environmental claims  resulted in an increase of million in asbestos reserves

specialty the specialty group s gross written premiums increased approximately for compared to  reflecting the impact of continuing rate increases and volume growth in most of its businesses 
specialty rate increases averaged approximately during and should be in the range of to in net written premiums increased in compared to the specialty group s combined ratio improved points over reflecting rate increases partially offset by million in higher prior year development in the growth in property and transportation gross written premiums reflects significant volume growth in the federal crop insurance program 
in addition  the other property and transportation business experienced rate increases and volume growth in the increase in gross written premium in specialty casualty primarily relates to rate increases 
the increase in specialty financial gross written premiums reflects rate increases as well as volume growth in the fidelity and crime products and certain collateral protection products 
the increase in california workers compensation relates mostly to rate increases 
the point improvement in property and transportation s combined ratio reflects rate increases  partially offset by million in additional prior year development in compared to specialty casualty s point combined ratio improvement is primarily due to rate increases 
the specialty financial combined ratio deterioration of points is primarily a result of the decline in results related to the residual value products 
lower used car prices  dealer incentives on new cars and the volume of used cars available from expiring leases contributed to the deterioration in the residual value results 
california workers compensation combined ratio improved points as rate increases and million of benefit related to recently enacted legislation were partially offset by increased claim costs

sop in july  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts 
the most significant accounting implications to gafri of the sop are as follows changing gafri s method for accounting for assets and liabilities related to two tier annuities and persistency bonuses  amortizing dpac over the life of deferred annuity contracts excluding the annuitization phase  and establishing an additional liability for guaranteed minimum death benefits for variable annuity contracts 
gafri will adopt the sop effective january  although interpretation of accounting for certain items covered by the sop has not been finalized  the effect of initially adopting this sop is expected to be less than of afg s equity and will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the results of operations 
this effect results primarily from the change in accounting for persistency bonuses 
gafri does not expect that the final amount will have a material adverse impact on the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by item a is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
