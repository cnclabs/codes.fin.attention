cash flow compared to net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately  in compared to  primarily due to lower mortgage investment income resulting from a reduction in the mortgage base  partially offset by a decrease in receivables and other assets 
the decrease in receivables and other assets is primarily due to the receipt of principal and interest previously accrued on the mortgages awaiting assignment from hud under the section program during net cash provided by investing activities increased by approximately million in compared to this increase is primarily due to an increase in proceeds received from mortgage assignments and the net proceeds from the debentures  partially offset by a decrease in proceeds received from the prepayment of mortgages 
net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately million in compared to due to a reduction in the amount of distributions paid to partners in compared to critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the partnership continually evaluates the estimates used to prepare the financial statements  and updates those estimates as necessary 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third parties  and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on the partnership s results of operations or financial condition 
the partnership s critical accounting estimates include the determination of fair values for insured mortgages fair value of insured mortgages the partnership estimates the fair value of its insured mortgages internally 
the partnership uses a discounted cash flow methodology to estimate the fair value 
this requires the partnership to make certain estimates regarding discount rates and expected prepayments 
the cash flows were discounted using a discount rate that  in the partnership s view  was commensurate with the market s perception of risk and value 
the partnership used a variety of sources to determine its discount rate including i institutionally available research reports  ii communications with dealers and active insured mortgage security investors regarding the valuation of comparable securities and iii recent transactions 
increases in the discount rate used by the partnership would generally result in a corresponding decrease in the fair value of the partnership s insured mortgages 
decreases in the discount rate used by the partnership would generally result in a corresponding increase in the fair value of the partnership s insured mortgages 
the partnership also makes certain assumptions regarding the prepayment speeds of its insured mortgages 
in a low interest rate environment  mortgages are more likely to prepay even if the mortgage contains prepayment penalties 
in general  if the partnership increases its assumed prepayment speed  the fair value of the insured mortgages will decrease 
if the partnership decreases its assumed prepayment speed  the fair value of the insured mortgages will increase 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the partnership s principal market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates in the us treasury market 
the partnership will experience fluctuations in the market value of its assets related to i changes in the interest rates of us treasury securities  ii changes in the spread between the interest rates on us treasury securities and the interest rates on the partnership s insured mortgages  and iii changes in the weighted average life of the insured mortgages  determined by reviewing the attributes of the insured mortgages in relation to the current market interest rates 
there would not be a material change in the fair value of the partnership s insured mortgages if the partnership assumed that the discount rate used to determine the fair values increased by basis points and basis points as of december  since the mortgages are generally pre payable and have weighted average lives of less than one year
