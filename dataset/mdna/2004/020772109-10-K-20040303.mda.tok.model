overview alpha pro tech is in the business of protecting people  products and environments 
we accomplish this by developing  manufacturing and marketing a line of disposable protective apparel and consumer products for the cleanroom  industrial  medical  dental and consumer markets 
our products are primarily sold under the alpha pro tech brand name  but are also sold for use under private label

our target markets are pharmaceutical manufacturing  bio pharmaceutical manufacturing and medical device manufacturing  lab animal research  high technology electronics manufacturing which includes the semi conductor market  as well as medical and dental distributors and the consumer market for pet products 
our products are used primarily in cleanrooms  industrial safety manufacturing environments  health care facilities such as hospitals  laboratories and dental offices 
our products are distributed principally in the united states through a network consisting of purchasing groups  national distributors  local distributors  independent sales representatives and our own sales and marketing force 
we have recently implemented a new strategy in conjunction with our distributors to communicate directly with the end users 
this enables us to better understand the end users true needs and ties into our innovative strategy which is to sell products that best satisfy the end users requirements 
in  we hired five additional sales personnel  increasing the sales team from ten to fifteen  and although it has taken time to find  educate and train the new staff  results are indicating that this approach is starting to work 
as we gain market share  we will invest in additional sales personnel
