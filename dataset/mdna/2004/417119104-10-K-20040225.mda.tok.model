 accounting for income taxes  requires  among other things  the recognition of deferred tax assets  including the future benefit associated with operating loss carryforwards  a periodic evaluation of the likelihood that the deferred tax assets are realizable and the establishment of a valuation allowance  in certain circumstances  to offset deferred tax assets to the extent realization is not considered more likely than not 
the company has concluded that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be fully realized and that a tax valuation reserve is not required

critical accounting policies the information provided below describing critical accounting policies is pursuant to securities and exchange commission financial reporting release no 
directing registrants to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are contained in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and  accordingly  include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management with due consideration given to materiality 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following represents those critical accounting policies where materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
receivables  net of allowances at november   accounts receivable  net of allowances  were million 
net receivables were determined based upon the company s evaluation of known requirements  aging of receivables  historical experience and the current economic environment 
amounts associated with potential return of products as well as customer chargebacks  net of expected recoveries  are reflected in net accounts receivable 
these types of allowances are reflected as a reduction of sales upon the determination that such allowances are reasonably estimatible and probable 
while the company believes it has appropriately considered known or expected outcomes  its customers ability to pay their obligations  including those to the company  could be adversely affected by declining sales of apparel at retail resulting from such factors as contraction in the economy or a general decline in consumer spending 
inventory valuation at november   inventories were million  and reflected the lifo valuation method for certain work in process and finished goods  as well as reductions from cost when required in order to state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the lower of cost or market valuation considers the estimated realizable value in the current economic environment associated with disposing of surplus inventories 
additional downward valuation adjustments could be required should the current economic climate significantly worsen  resulting in retailers being unwilling to accept deliveries of advance orders placed or the company electing not to ship inventories to those retailers where additional credit risk is not deemed appropriate  or if a significant contraction were to occur in demand for the company s in stock replenishment business for selected product categories 
the potential additional downward valuation adjustments could result from unanticipated additional excess quantities of finished goods and raw materials  and or from lower disposition values offered by the parties who normally purchase surplus inventories 
deferred tax assets at november   the accompanying consolidated balance sheet reflected million of deferred tax assets  a majority of which related to tax operating loss carryforwards 
as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company had approximately million of tax operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income  of which approximately million expire in the period 
in general  such carryforwards must be utilized within years of incurring the net operating loss within years with respect to the tax loss incurred in 
at november   the company concluded that it is more likely than not that there would be sufficient taxable earnings to fully utilize the operating loss carryforwards and no tax valuation allowance was required 
a tax valuation reserve could be required in whole or in part in the future should the company s actual earnings or prospective earnings decrease the likelihood that sufficient taxable earnings will be generated to fully utilize the available carryforwards 
fully utilizing the million available operating loss carryforwards expiring by the end of fiscal would require average annual taxable earnings of approximately million over the period 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the value of net tangible assets of businesses acquired 
effective december   goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized  but instead are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indications arise 
impairment tests  which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market value of the business operations with which goodwill is associated  were performed by the company in the second quarter of this evaluation indicated that no impairment adjustment was required 
aggregate goodwill of million at november  increased million during the year primarily from the additional contingent consideration earned by the seller of the cag business pursuant to the purchase agreement 
goodwill may increase further based upon the achievement of specified levels of earnings before interest and taxes during five annual periods  as defined  beginning july   or upon a change in control 
should the operation of the businesses with which goodwill is associated incur significant profitability and cash flow declines in future years  some or all of the recorded goodwill could be subject to impairment 
revenue recognition sales are recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are net of anticipated returns  discounts and allowances 
as noted previously  amounts associated with the potential return of products and customer chargebacks net of expected recoveries are reflected as a reduction of sales and accounts receivable upon the determination that such allowances are reasonably estimable and probable 
shipping and handling revenues are included in revenues while the actual costs are reflected in cost of sales 
sales taxes  if any  are excluded from revenues 
self insurance reserves the company retains certain of the financial risk for insuring workers compensation and employee group health claims 
operations are charged with the cost of claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
insurance accruals include estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of estimates  some of which are actuarially determined  of incurred but not reported claims

men s tailored clothing revenues in are anticipated to be about even with while consumers seem to be moving away from everyday casual dress  some of the department store channels did not realize tailored clothing increases during should tailored clothing demand increase in this channel  the extensive range of well recognized and diversified tailored clothing product offerings positions the company to benefit from incremental operating margin opportunities 
in the women s apparel group  additional volume is expected in the andrea jovine line  introduced in fall  from dedicated brand programs with certain retailers  and from further growth in the direct to consumer business with its increasing percentage of web initiated orders 
the august  refinancing was the significant contributor to the more than reduction in interest expense in to million from million in  and which established a financing structure to complement the company s operational strategies
