item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business and operations 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements 
general overview we were formed on august  as a delaware corporation 
we began invoicing our customers for our services in april we provide our high speed internet access service to our customers in buildings directly connected to our fiber optic network which we call our on net services 
we charge monthly fees for on net services 
our april  acquisition of certain assets of psinet  inc added a new element to our operations in that in addition to our current high speed internet access business  we began operating a more traditional internet service provider business  with lower speed connections provided by leased circuits obtained from telecommunications carriers primarily local telephone companies 
we call these services our off net services 
our february   merger with allied riser also added a new element to our operations as we began offering voice services in toronto  canada through our subsidiary  shared technologies of canada 
on january  we acquired firstmark communications participations sarl the parent company to lambdanet france and lambdanet spain  as new european subsidiaries 
these companies provide both on net and off net services 
our core product set  which we actively market  is comprised of three primary product groups 
our type i on net internet access allows customers to directly connect to our network in approximately north american buildings 
these connections utilize facilities  which are controlled by us up to the customer premise 
we operate in building facilities that include riser distribution and cables as well as cross connections or horizontal connections directly to the customers terminating equipment 
the customers traffic is then transmitted across our network by equipment located within the building in which the service is sold exists 
our second major product group is type ii dedicated internet access 
this product includes customers located in buildings in we do not have direct fiber connectivity 
we utilize traditional t  e  e and t transport circuits leased from local telecomm providers to provide this service 
the majority of these circuits are leased from an incumbent local exchange carrier  or a competitive or alternate local exchange carrier 
these dedicated transport circuits terminate at the customer s location and are then connected at the receiving location to our fiber optic internet backbone 
we operate fifty two point of presence pop locations that are aggregation points for these services in north america 
the third major product line that we actively support is co location services within the data centers that we operate 
within these centers we provide our customers rack space in which the customer may place its own equipment or servers 
we generally include with those racks dedicated internet access bandwidth service to those customers 
we believe that our type i ethernet services provides us the greatest gross margin 
for this service there is little additional equipment or services required to connect additional customers in our lit buildings to our network 
the primary focus of our direct sales force is to sell these type i products in the approximately buildings which we have on net in north america 
these buildings include large commercial office buildings in which we sell our services to companies that utilize dedicated internet access to support their businesses 
we also sell into carrier neutral co location facilities  telehouses  data centers and carrier hotels where we sell dedicated internet access to companies that incorporate our services into their final products 
we believe that these businesses generally utilize internet access as one of their primary components in offering services to their end customers 
our type ii services are sold through a telesales organization to small and medium sized businesses that are located in buildings generally within a ten mile radius of our fifty two pops in north america 
the dedicated internet access sold to these customers is generally of significantly lower speeds than those services sold in our type i facilities 
we believe that these products generally produce lower gross margins because each sale requires us to purchase dedicated type ii circuit from a local service provider 
this circuit is generally provided as a transport link and is then connected between the customer premise and our pop 
we then provide layer transit services over these links 
when possible we attempt to only commit to layer i transport purchase contracts that corresponded to the term of our dedicated internet access contract with our customers 
in some instances we have acquired customers in which the layer contract term and the dedicated internet access term may not coincide 
in our data centers  we actively market our co location and bandwidth services 
these facilities are on net to us 
we believe that the incremental costs associated with adding additional customers within these facilities are attributable only to the incremental power used by the customer s equipment 
our facilities have significant additional capacity to add customers and we do not anticipate needing to spend additional capital to augment these facilities 
we continue to support non core products we have assumed in our acquisitions of various companies 
these products include managed hosting  shared hosting  email services  dial up internet access  voice services and point to point transport services 
we do not actively market these services with the exception of point to point transport services in our european region and voice services in canada 
as we have acquired various operations of other companies we have attempted to maintain a common network architecture 
each of the acquired networks  as it is integrated into our network  is reconfigured to mirror our layer ip architecture 
we have strived to consolidate services on a common network platform 
we also have consolidated various information technology systems and back office processes into a standard architecture  where possible  which is supported throughout all of our operating geographic regions 
this integration process continues as we continue the transition from acquired legacy systems to our standard information technology platforms 
recent developments resolution of default under cisco credit facility and sale of series f and series g preferred stock 
prior to july  we were party to a million credit facility with cisco systems capital corporation cisco capital 
the credit facility required compliance with certain financial and operational covenants 
we were in violation of a financial covenant as of december  and as a result cisco capital could have accelerated the due date of our indebtedness 
these developments are discussed in greater detail below under liquidity and capital resources 
on june   our board of directors unanimously adopted a resolution authorizing us to consummate a transaction with cisco capital and cisco systems  inc cisco that would restructure our indebtedness to cisco capital as well as to offer and sell a new series of preferred stock to certain of our existing stockholders in order to acquire the cash needed to complete the restructuring 
on june   our stockholders approved these transactions 
in order to complete the restructuring we entered into an agreement the exchange agreement with cisco and cisco capital pursuant to which  among other things  cisco and cisco capital agreed to cancel the principal amount of indebtedness plus accrued interest and return warrants exercisable for the purchase of million shares of our common stock the cisco warrants in exchange for our cash payment of million  the issuance of  shares of our series f participating convertible preferred stock  and the issuance of an amended and restated promissory note for the aggregate principal amount of million 
at the closing of the restructuring on july   we were indebted to cisco capital for a total of million million of principal and million of accrued interest 
in order to complete the restructuring we also entered into an agreement the purchase agreement with certain of our existing preferred stockholders the investors  pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to the investors in several sub series   shares of our series g participating convertible preferred stock for million in cash 
on july   we closed the transactions contemplated by the exchange agreement and the purchase agreement 
on january  we acquired firstmark communications participations sarl  the parent company to lambdanet communications france sas and lambdanet communications espana sa together  lambdanet france and spain  from lng holdings sa by merging a subsidiary of ours with a company that had acquired them 
we issued our series i preferred stock to the owners of the company that had acquired lambdanet france and spain 
this transaction is described in greater detail in note to our financial statements 
we attempted to acquire lambdanet communications deutschland  ag lncd  a sister company of lambdanet france and spain  but were unable to reach agreement with lncd s bank creditors 
lncd filed for insolvency in germany on february  lambdanet france and spain have made use of lncd s facilities to complete communications circuits into germany and also have depended on lncd for network operations support  billing and other services 
we have begun the process of fully separating the operations of lambdanet france and spain from lncd but that is not complete and there may be disruptions as this process proceeds 
we have entered into an agreement to acquire another german network  and may acquire additional european networks 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following summary table presents a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december  and with respect to certain key financial measures 
the comparisons illustrated in the table are discussed in greater detail below 
year ended december  percent change dollars in thousands net service revenues   network operation costs   selling  general  and administrative expenses   depreciation and amortization expense   interest income   interest expense   net income loss applicable to common stockholders   net service revenue 
net service revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ending december  the increase in net service revenue is primarily attributable to the increase in revenue from customers purchasing our on net internet access service offerings and the increase in off net revenue from the customers acquired in the fnsi acquisition 
revenue related to the acquired assets of fnsi has been included in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
the fnsi acquisition closed on february  our increase in revenue was offset by a decline in revenues from the customers acquired in our april  acquisition of certain psinet customer accounts and a stricter policy on cancellation of uncollectible customer accounts 
network operations costs 
network operations costs during and were primarily comprised of the following elements the cost of leased network equipment sites and facilities  salaries and related expenses of employees directly involved with our network activities  transit charges amounts paid to service providers as compensation for connecting to the internet  leased circuits obtained from telecommunications carriers primarily local telephone companies  building access agreement fees paid to landlords  and maintenance charges related to our nationwide fiber optic intercity network and metro rings 
the cost of network operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the cost of network operations for the year ended december  and december  includes approximately million and million  respectively  of amortization of deferred compensation expense 
the increase in amortization of deferred compensation expense is due to the amortization of deferred compensation expense recorded in connection with the grant of shares of series h preferred stock to our employees in deferred compensation is being amortized over the vesting period of the series h preferred stock 
the vesting period for grants under our offer to exchange is upon grant with the remaining shares vesting ratably over a three year period  and for new employees after one year and then ratably over a four year period 
total compensation expense related to series h preferred stock was approximately million for the year ended december  beginning with the april  psinet acquisition  we incurred transitional circuit and maintenance fees that were required to be paid for a seventy five day period under the psinet asset purchase agreement and recurring circuit fees for providing psinet s off net internet access service 
recurring circuit fees decreased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to a reduction in the number of psinet customers partly offset by an increase in circuit fees as a result of the february  fnsi acquisition 
fees associated with tenant license agreements acquired in the allied riser acquisition decreased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to the termination of many of these agreements 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  primarily include salaries and related administrative costs 
sg a expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sg a expenses for the year ended december  and december  included approximately million and million  respectively  of amortization of deferred compensation expense 
the increase in amortization of deferred compensation expense is due to the amortization described above of deferred compensation expense recorded in connection with the our granting of shares of series h preferred stock to our employees in total compensation expense related to series h preferred stock was approximately million for the year ended december  sg a for the year ended december  and december  included approximately million and million  respectively  of net expense for the valuation allowance for doubtful accounts 
sg a expenses before amortization of deferred compensation decreased primarily from a decrease in transitional activities associated with the psinet and allied riser acquisitions and a decrease in headcount partially offset by an increase in the net expense for the valuation allowance for doubtful accounts 
we capitalize the salaries and related benefits of employees directly involved with our construction activities 
we began capitalizing these costs in july and will continue to capitalize these costs while we are involved in construction activities 
we capitalized million of these costs for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decline in capitalized costs is due to a decrease in construction activities 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation of our property and equipment and the amortization of our intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation expense related to property and equipment was approximately million and million  for the years ended december  and december  respectively 
depreciation expense increased because we had more capital equipment and irus in service in than in the same period in amortization expense related to intangible assets for the year ended december  and december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
amortization expense increased because we had more intangible assets in than in the same period in we begin to depreciate our capital assets once the related assets are placed in service 
we believe that future depreciation expense will continue to increase primarily due to additional equipment being placed in service and an increase in irus as we expand our network 
interest income and expense 
interest income relates to interest earned on our marketable securities including money market accounts  certificates of deposit and commercial paper 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the reduction in interest income resulted from a decrease in marketable securities and a reduction in interest rates 
interest expense includes interest charged on our credit facility  capital lease agreements  the convertible subordinated notes issued by our subsidiary allied riser and the amortization of deferred financing costs 
interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense resulted from the cancellation of million in principal amount of the riser convertible subordinated notes under the march settlement and exchange  the july  restructuring of our credit facility with cisco capital which eliminated the amortization of our deferred financing costs and significantly reduced our indebtedness to cisco capital and to a lesser extent  a reduction in interest rates 
borrowings under the credit facility accrued interest at the three month libor rate  established at the beginning of each calendar quarter  plus percent 
the cisco restructuring transaction was considered a troubled debt restructuring under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting by debtors and creditors of troubled debt restructurings 
under sfas no 
 the million amended and restated cisco note was recorded at its principal amount plus the estimated future interest payments 
interest payments begin in the st month following the effectiveness of the restructuring transaction and accrue at ninety day libor plus 
no interest is payable  nor does interest accrue on the amended and restated cisco note for the first months  unless the company defaults under the terms of the amended and restated credit agreement 
we believe that future interest expense will continue at a decreased rate due to the july  cancellation of debt outstanding under our credit facility  as discussed above 
income taxes 
we recorded no income tax expense or benefit for the year ended december  or the year ended december  due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of our net operating losses and our other deferred tax assets  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax asset 
for federal and state tax purposes  our net operating loss carry forwards could be subject to certain limitations on annual utilization if certain changes in ownership were to occur as defined by federal and state tax laws 
for federal and state tax purposes  our net operating loss carry forwards acquired in the allied riser merger will be subject to certain limitations on annual utilization due to the change in ownership as defined by federal and state tax laws 
however  we achieve profitability  our net deferred tax assets may be available to offset future income tax liabilities 
under section a b of the internal revenue code of gross income does not include any amount that would be includible in gross income by reason of the discharge of indebtedness to the extent that a non bankrupt taxpayer is insolvent 
under section a b we believe that the gains on our debt restructuring with cisco and settlement and exchange agreement with allied riser note holders will not result in taxable income  however  our net operating loss carry forwards will be significantly reduced effective january  in connection with these transactions 
settlement of note holder litigation and gain on note exchange 
in january  we entered into an exchange agreement and a settlement agreement with the holders of approximately million in face value of convertible subordinated notes issued by our subsidiary  allied riser 
pursuant to the exchange agreement  these note holders surrendered their notes  including accrued and unpaid interest thereon  in exchange for a cash payment of approximately million  million shares of our series d preferred stock and million shares of our series e preferred stock 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  the note holders dismissed with prejudice litigation filed by the note holders in delaware chancery court against allied riser 
these transactions closed in march when the agreed amounts were paid and the series d and series e preferred shares were issued 
this settlement and exchange eliminated the approximately million principal payment obligation due in september  interest accrued since the december  interest payment  all future interest payment obligations on these notes and settled the note holder litigation in exchange for the total cash payments of approximately million and the issuance of preferred stock 
at issuance  this preferred stock was convertible into approximately of our then outstanding fully diluted common stock 
the terms of the remaining million of subordinated convertible notes were not impacted by these transactions and they continue to be due on june  these notes were recorded at their fair value of approximately million at the merger date 
the discount is accreted to interest expense through the maturity date as of december   we had accrued the amount payable under the settlement agreement  net of the recovery of million under our insurance policy 
this resulted in a net expense of million recorded in the fourth quarter of the million payment under the settlement agreement was made in march we received the million recovered under our insurance policy in april the exchange agreement resulted in a gain of approximately million recorded during the year ended december  the gain resulted from the difference between the million net book value of the notes million face value less the related unamortized discount of million and million of accrued interest and the consideration of approximately million in cash and the million estimated fair market value for the series d and series e preferred stock less approximately million of transaction costs 
gain cisco credit facility restructuring 
the restructuring of our cisco credit facility on july  resulted in a gain of approximately million 
on a basic income and diluted income per share basis the gain was and for the year ended december   respectively 
the gain resulted from the retirement of the amounts outstanding under the cisco credit facility and was determined as follows in thousands cash paid  issuance of series f preferred stock  amended and restated cisco note  principal plus future interest  transaction costs  total consideration  amount outstanding under facility interest accrued under the facility  book value of cancelled warrants  book value of unamortized facility loan costs  gain from exchange agreement  earnings per share 
basic net loss income per common share applicable to common stock was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding increased to million shares for the year ended december  from million shares for the year ended december  due to the july  conversion of our series a  b  c  d and e convertible preferred stock into million shares of common stock 
a beneficial conversion charge of million was recorded on july  since the conversion rates on our series f and series g convertible preferred stock at issuance were less than the trading price of our common stock on that date 
the beneficial conversion charge reduced basic earnings per common share by for the year ended december  without the charge  basic earnings per common share was for the year ended december  the allied riser merger resulted in an extraordinary gain of million  or per common share for the year ended december  the loss per common share  excluding the impact of the extraordinary gain  was for the year ended december  diluted net loss income per common share applicable to common stock was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding increased to million shares for the year ended december  from million shares for the year ended december  due primarily to the february  issuance of series d and series e convertible preferred stock  which were converible into approximately million shares of our common stock  the july  issuance of series f and series g convertible preferred stock which is convertible into a total of million shares of our common stock  the july  conversion of our series a  b and c convertible preferred stock into approximately million shares of common stock and the issuance of our shares of series h preferred stock which is convertible into a total of approximately million shares of our common stock

management believes that if we are able to increase the number of customers using our services as planned  our current cash position and the cash obtained in the merger with symposium omega  inc omega would be sufficient to fund our operations until we generate more cash than we consume

critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
such judgments affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continuously evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  revenue allowances  long lived assets  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize service revenue when the services are performed  evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
service discounts and incentives related to telecommunications services are recorded as a reduction of revenue when granted or ratably over the estimated customer life 
fees billed in connection with customer installations and other upfront charges are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated customer life 
direct costs incurred for provisioning and installing a customer and sales and commission costs associated with acquiring the new customer are expensed as incurred 
we establish a valuation allowance for collection of doubtful accounts and other sales credit adjustments 
valuation allowances for sales credits are established through a charge to revenue  while valuation allowances for doubtful accounts are established through a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses 
we assess the adequacy of these reserves monthly by evaluating general factors  such as the length of time individual receivables are past due  historical collection experience  the economic and competitive environment  and changes in the credit worthiness of our customers 
as considered necessary  we also assess the ability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to us and establish specific valuation allowances based on the amount we expect to collect from these customers 
we believe that our established valuation allowances were adequate as of december  and december  if circumstances relating to specific customers change or economic conditions worsen such that our past collection experience and assessment of the economic environment are no longer valid  our estimate of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be changed 
if this occurs  we adjust our valuation allowance in the period the new information is known 
we invoice certain customers for amounts contractually due for unfulfilled minimum contractual obligations 
we recognize a corresponding sales allowance equal to this revenue resulting in the recognition of zero net revenue 
we recognize net revenue as these billings are collected in cash 
we vigorously seek payment of these amounts 
we record assets and liabilities under capital leases at the lesser of the present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the assets under lease 
we capitalize the direct costs incurred prior to an asset being ready for service as construction in progress 
construction in progress includes costs incurred under the construction contract  interest  and the salaries and benefits of employees directly involved with construction activities 
we record deferred compensation for options issued with exercise prices less than the estimated fair market value of our common stock at grant date 
prior to becoming a public company  we estimated the fair market value of our common stock based upon our most recent equity transaction 
subsequent to becoming a public company  we determine the fair value of our common stock by its closing price on the american stock exchange 
we estimate the fair market value of our equity securities which do not trade publicly based upon our most recent equity transaction for cash 
we estimate the fair market value of indemnifications utilizing a weighted average discounted cash flow analysis 
we estimate the fair market value of our series h preferred stock based upon the number of common shares the series h preferred stock converts into and the trading price of our common stock on the grant date 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  and intangible assets with definite useful lives to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be addressed pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 

pursuant to sfas no 
 impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to our best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
as of december  and december  we tested our long lived assets for impairment 
we believe that no impairment existed under sfas no 
as of december  and december  in the event that there are changes in the planned use of our long lived assets or our expected future undiscounted cash flows are reduced significantly  our assessment of our ability to recover the carrying value of these assets under sfas no 
could change 
because management s best estimate of undiscounted cash flows generated from these assets exceeds their carrying value for each of the periods presented  no impairment pursuant to sfas no 
exists 
however  because of the significant difficulties confronting the telecommunications industry  management believes that currently the fair value of our long lived assets including our network assets and iru s are significantly below the amounts we originally paid for them and may be less than their current depreciated cost basis 
we account for our business combinations pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

under sfas no 
we allocate the cost of an acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
intangible assets are recognized when they arise from contractual or other legal rights or if they are separable as defined by sfas no 
we determine estimated fair values using quoted market prices  when available  or the using present values determined at appropriate current interest rates 
consideration not in the form of cash is measured based upon the fair value of the consideration given 
we account for our intangible assets pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

under sfas no 
we determine the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected use of the intangible asset  contractual provisions  obsolescence and other factors 
we amortized our intangible assets on a straight line basis 
we presently have no intangible assets that are not subject to amortization 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our financial interests that are sensitive to market risk are entered into for purposes other than trading 
our primary market risk exposure is related to our marketable securities 
we place our marketable securities investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
marketable securities were approximately million at december   million of which are considered cash equivalents and mature in days or less and million are short term investments consisting of commercial paper and certificates of deposit 
approximately million of these investments are restricted for collateral against letters of credit totaling million 
we also own approximately million of commercial paper investments million and a canadian treasury bill million that are classified as other long term assets 
these investments are restricted for collateral against letters of credit totaling approximately million 
as described in item effective on july  we restructured our debt with cisco capital and reduced the principal amount outstanding to million 
the restructured debt is evidenced by an amended and restated note the new note for million payable to cisco capital 
the new note was issued under the current credit agreement that is to be repaid in three installments 
no interest is payable on the new note for the first months unless we default under the terms of the amended and restated credit agreement 
principal and interest is paid as follows a million principal payment is due after months  a million principal payment plus interest accrued is due in months  and a final principal payment of million plus interest is due in months 
when the new note accrues interest  interest accrues at the day libor rate plus 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the level at december   the change to our interest sensitive assets and liabilities would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
a increase in the weighted average interest rate for the year ended december  would have increased our interest expense for the period by approximately million
