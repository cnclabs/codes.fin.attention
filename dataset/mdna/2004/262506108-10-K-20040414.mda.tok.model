overview our business we provide high speed data communications  internet access  and related services to small dollars in thousands  except per share amounts and medium sized businesses and branch offices of larger businesses and their remote office users  throughout the united states  primarily utilizing digital subscriber line dsl and t technology 
in september of  we expanded our service offerings to business customers in select mid atlantic and northeast markets to include integrated voice and data services using voip 
our networks enable data transport over existing copper telephone lines at speeds of up to megabits per second 
our product offerings also include web hosting  domain name system management  enhanced e mail  on line data backup and recovery services  firewalls  nationwide dial up services  private frame relay services and virtual private networks 
we sell directly to businesses  primarily through our own direct sales force  and to third party resellers whose end users are typically business class customers 
we deploy our own local communications equipment primarily in select first and second tier cities 
in certain markets where we have not deployed our own equipment  we utilize the local facilities of other carriers to provide our service 
our growth strategy in addition to our internal sales and marketing efforts  our strategic goals have been focused on accelerating our growth and expanding our network and customer base through select acquisitions of customer lines  assets and or businesses 
during  we completed the following strategically significant acquisitions o in january  we acquired the majority of network access solutions corporation s nas operations and assets  including operations and equipment in approximately central offices extending from virginia to massachusetts  and approximately  subscriber lines the nas assets 
this acquisition significantly increased our facilities based footprint in one of the largest business markets in the united states  providing us with increased opportunities to sell more higher margin  facilities based services 
currently  we operate equipment in approximately central offices located in approximately cities in the united states 
o in september  we acquired substantially all of the assets and subscribers of talkingnets  inc  a voice and data communications provider that offered soft switched based voip and high speed data services to businesses 
this acquisition gave us the capability to offer business customers in the business intensive mid atlantic and northeast regions a carrier class integrated voice and data service which utilizes voip 
in december  we introduced in the washington  dc metropolitan region  an expanded range of voip products that offered integrated voice and data services utilizing dsl based services in addition to our t based services 
in february  we introduced our full suite of voip and data bundles in the new york city metropolitan area 
we continuously identify and evaluate acquisition candidates  and in many cases engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions 
acquisition candidates include both subscriber lines and whole businesses 
our discussions and negotiations may not result in an acquisition 
further  if we make any acquisitions  we may not be able to operate any acquired businesses profitably or otherwise successfully implement our expansion strategy 
we intend to continue to seek additional opportunities for further acquisitions  which we believe represents a distinct opportunity to accelerate our growth 
we may need to obtain additional funding to finance additional acquisitions  accordingly  we continue to engage and pursue discussions with potential investors 
dollars in thousands  except per share amounts we also believe there are significant revenue growth opportunities for our newly introduced voip suite of integrated voice and data services 
we may also seek additional funding to expand our voice network in order to accelerate this growth opportunity 
our cash financings and constraints although we have made noticeable progress in reducing the amount of cash used by our operations  we have not been able to finance our operations from cash provided by operations 
in  and  net cash used in our operating activities was approximately   and  respectively 
the reductions in cash used for operating activities as a percent of revenues over the three year period was primarily attributable to increased revenues and related margins  primarily resulting from acquisitions  combined with reduced operational expenses network  operations  selling  general and administrative expenses  primarily resulting from our restructuring and cost containment efforts discussed below 
we also have incurred operating losses and net losses for each month since our formation in as of december  and  we had accumulated deficits of approximately  and  respectively 
in addition  our growth strategies have required significant capital and cash investments 
our operating cash shortfalls and investments have been financed principally with the proceeds from the sale of stock and from borrowings  including equipment lease financings 
our most significant recent financings include o in july  we executed a note and warrant purchase agreement for the sale of  in senior secured promissory notes and issuance of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share for an aggregate purchase price for the notes and warrants of  we used approximately  of the proceeds from this financing to prepay approximately  in pre existing debt and lease obligations 
o in late and early  we secured additional private equity financing from the sale of  of our series x and series y preferred stock 
our independent accountants have noted in their report that our sustained operating losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our business plan includes modest revenue growth for generated from internal direct marketing sales efforts and additional operational cost savings to be obtained from streamlining our network and further reducing discretionary and controllable costs 
during the last quarter of and the first quarter of  we began implementing some of these cost reduction measures  including a reduction in force of approximately employees on march  accordingly  based on our current business plans and projections as approved by our board of directors  we believe that our existing cash and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating losses  capital expenditures  lease payments  and working capital requirements into failure to generate sufficient revenues  contain certain discretionary spending or achieve certain other business plan objectives could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position  including our ability to continue as a going concern 
we intend to use our cash resources to finance our capital expenditures and for our working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we may also need additional funding to pursue our strategic objective of accelerating our growth through acquisition of complementary businesses  subscriber lines and other assets 
the amounts actually expended for these purposes will vary dollars in thousands  except per share amounts significantly depending on a number of factors  including market acceptance of our services  revenue growth  planned capital expenditures  cash generated from operations  improvements in operating productivity  the extent and timing of entry into new markets  and availability of and prices paid for acquisitions 
our cash requirements may vary based upon the timing and the success of implementation of our business plan or if o demand for our services or our cash flow from operations is less than or more than expected  o our plans or projections change or prove to be inaccurate  o we make acquisitions  o we alter the schedule or targets of our business plan implementation  or o we curtail and or reorganize our operations 
our financial performance  and whether we achieve profitability or become cash flow positive  will depend on a number of factors  including o development of the high speed data communications industry and our ability to compete effectively  o amount  timing and pricing of customer revenue  o availability  timing and pricing of acquisition opportunities  and our ability to capitalize on such opportunities  o commercial acceptance of our service and attaining expected penetration within our target markets  o our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel  o up front sales and marketing expenses  o cost and utilization of our network components which we lease from other telecommunications providers  including other competitive carriers  o our ability to establish and maintain relationships with marketing partners  o successful implementation and management of financial  information management and operations support systems to efficiently and cost effectively manage our operational growth  and o favorable outcome of federal and state regulatory proceedings and related judicial proceedings  including proceedings relating to the telecommunications act and the federal communications commissions triennial review order 
dollars in thousands  except per share amounts there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our business plan objectives or that we will achieve or maintain cash flow positive operating results 
if we are unable to generate adequate funds from our operations  we may not be able to continue to operate our network  respond to competitive pressures or fund our operations 
as a result  we may be required to significantly reduce  reorganize  discontinue or shut down our operations 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty 
critical accounting policies  estimates and risks management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
the markets for our services are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological development  regulatory and legislative changes  and frequent new product introductions  all of which could impact the future value of our assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
the most significant estimates relate to revenue recognition  goodwill and other long lived assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods and the judgments and estimates used by us in their application 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
revenue is recognized pursuant to the terms of each contract on a monthly service fee basis  which varies based on the speed of the customer s internet connection and the services ordered by the customer 
the monthly fee includes phone line charges  internet access charges  the cost of the equipment installed at the customer s site and the other services we provide  as applicable 
revenue that is billed in advance of the services provided is deferred until the services are rendered 
revenue related to installation charges is also deferred and amortized to revenue over months 
related direct costs incurred up to the amount of deferred revenue are also deferred and amortized to expense over months 
any excess direct costs over installation charges are charged to expense as incurred 
in certain instances  we negotiate credits and allowances for dollars in thousands  except per share amounts service related matters 
we establish a reserve for such credits based on historical experience 
from time to time we offer sales incentives to our customers in the form of rebates toward select installation services and customer premise equipment 
we record a liability based on historical experience for such estimated rebate costs  with a corresponding reduction to revenue 
we seek to price our services competitively 
the market for high speed data communications services and internet access is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
while many of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us  we are pursuing a significant market that  we believe  is currently under served 
although pricing is an important part of our strategy  we believe that direct relationships with our customers and consistent  high quality service and customer support will be key to generating customer loyalty 
during the past several years  market prices for many telecommunications services and equipment have been declining  a trend that might continue 
goodwill and other long lived assets we account for our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
 which requires that long lived assets and certain intangible assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  an impairment loss is to be recognized based on the fair value of the assets 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

this statement requires that the amortization of goodwill be discontinued and instead an impairment approach be applied 
the impairment tests were performed during the first quarter of and last quarters of and  and will be performed annually hereafter or more often if adverse events occur and are based upon a fair value approach rather than an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows 
if impairment exists  under sfas no 
 the resulting charge is determined by the recalculation of goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill 
we did not record any goodwill impairment adjustments resulting from our impairment reviews during and other long lived assets  such as identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets  are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances provide evidence that suggests that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable  with impairment being based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flow 
if impaired  the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset s carrying cost over its fair value 
if market conditions become less favorable  future cash flows the key variable in assessing the impairment of these assets may decrease and as a result we may be required to recognize impairment charges 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we primarily sell our services directly to end users mainly consisting of small to medium sized businesses  but we also sell our services to dollars in thousands  except per share amounts certain resellers  such as to internet service providers isps 
we believe that we do not have significant exposure or concentrations of credit risk with respect to any given customer  as no customer accounted for more than of annual revenues for the years ended december   or  respectively 
however  if the country or any region we service  experiences an economic downturn  the financial condition of our customers could be adversely affected  which could result in their inability to make payments to us 
this could require additional provisions for allowances 
in addition  a negative impact on revenue related to those customers may occur 
with the acquisition of the nas assets on january   we acquired a number of end users  some of whom we service indirectly through various isps 
we sell our services to such isp s who then resell such services to the end user 
we have some increased exposure and concentration of credit risk pertaining to such isps 
however  no individual customer accounted for more than of revenue for inventory inventories consist of modems and routers customer premise equipment or cpe which we either sell or lease to customers  and are required to establish a high speed dsl or t digital connection 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost of inventory is determined on the first in  first out fifo or average cost methods 
we establish inventory reserves for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory based on changes in customer demand  technology developments and other factors 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  as set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards  all calculated using presently enacted tax rates 
we have not generated any taxable income to date and  therefore  have not paid any federal income taxes since inception 
our state and federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and  respectively 
use of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to significant annual limitations resulting from a change in control due to securities issuances including our sales of series x preferred stock and series y preferred stock in and and from the sale of  in notes and warrants in we are currently assessing the potential impact resulting from these transactions 
we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax asset since management has not determined that these future benefits will more likely than not be realized 
litigation from time to time  we may be involved in litigation concerning claims arising in the ordinary course of our business  including claims brought by current or former employees and claims related to acquisitions 
we record liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
these estimates are based on an analysis made by legal counsel who consider information known at the time 
we believe we have made reasonable estimates in the past  however  court decisions could cause liabilities to be incurred in excess of estimates

in december  we initiated a new business plan strategy designed to conserve our capital  reduce our losses and extend our cash resources 
this strategy included the following actions i further network expansion was curtailed  ii network connections to central offices were suspended  iii certain facilities were vacated and consolidated  iv operating expenses were reduced  and v headcount was reduced by approximately employees 
these actions resulted in a restructuring charge of approximately  the components of the restructuring charge were i approximately relating to severance expense for the employees  ii approximately  for estimated costs resulting from the consolidation of our office facilities by vacating office space located in milford  connecticut  santa cruz  california  atlanta  georgia and chantilly  virginia  and iii approximately  for termination costs and write offs associated with our decision to not accept certain central office collocation applications previously applied for  and to forego the completion of our build out of certain other central offices 
at december   approximately of severance costs and approximately  of capitalized collocation application fees had been charged against the restructuring reserves 
the remaining reserve balance of approximately  was included in our accrued liabilities at december  as part of our restructuring in december  we vacated certain office space in milford  connecticut and chantilly  virginia and did not occupy certain space in santa cruz  california 
during  we vacated our office space located in atlanta  georgia and santa cruz  california 
as of december   we were successful in terminating our lease for office space in chantilly  virginia and in assigning our lease in atlanta  georgia 
during  we also entered into a sublease agreement which ended in july  on our office space in santa cruz  california 
in february  we were successful in terminating our obligations under the lease for office space in milford  connecticut 
in march  we re evaluated our restructuring reserve and booked an increase in the reserve of approximately  which was primarily related to delays in subleasing our vacated facilities and additional estimated costs pertaining to our suspended central offices 
in june  due to the lack of liquidity in the financial markets  we further re evaluated our business plans and determined that additional actions were necessary to further reduce our operating losses  cash burn rate and total funding requirements 
these actions included i closure of approximately central offices  and ii an additional reduction in force of approximately employees 
these actions resulted in additional restructuring and impairment charges of approximately  included in this amount were i approximately relating to severance expenses for the employees  ii approximately  for the costs associated with the our decision to close central offices  which includes approximately  relating to termination and equipment removal fees and approximately  in write off of fixed assets  iii approximately  for additional estimated costs resulting from delays and expected losses in subleasing vacated office space located in santa cruz  california  atlanta  dollars in thousands  except per share amounts georgia  milford  connecticut  and chantilly  virginia  iv  for write downs of additional equipment no longer in use  and v  for impairments of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment analysis was accomplished by comparing the carrying value of the assets with the expected future net cash flows generated over the remaining useful life of the assets 
since the carrying value was more than the expected future net cash flows  the goodwill was reduced to the net present value of the expected future net cash flows 
of this amount   related to a reduction in the goodwill for our acquisition of tycho networks  inc tycho and  related to a reduction in the goodwill for our acquisition of certain assets of trusted net media holdings  llc trusted net 
these reductions in goodwill resulted in decreases in monthly amortization expense from approximately to approximately for tycho  and from approximately to approximately for trusted net 
during the third quarter  due to limited available financing for our operations and other factors  we again re evaluated our business plans and determined that additional actions were necessary to further reduce our operating losses  cash burn rate and total funding requirements 
these actions included closure of the tycho and trusted net facilities in santa cruz  california and atlanta  georgia  respectively  and our decision not to install equipment in new central offices 
these actions resulted in additional restructuring and impairment charges of approximately  included in this amount were i increases of approximately  relating to the write off of equipment  ii approximately for additional estimated costs relating to the delays and losses in subleasing vacated office space located in santa cruz  california and milford  connecticut  iii approximately in additional costs for equipment removal fees associated with our previous decision to close certain central offices  and iv approximately for impairments of goodwill 
these increases in the restructuring reserve were partially offset by a reduction of approximately  in previously reserved amounts relating to estimated termination fees associated with our previous decision to close certain central offices  as we were successful in negotiating significantly reduced fees at many of the closed central office locations 
the goodwill impairment analysis was accomplished by comparing the carrying value of the assets with the expected future net cash flows generated over the remaining useful life of the assets 
as a result of this analysis  expected future net cash flows were determined to be insignificant and  as the carrying value was more than these expected future net cash flows  the balance of goodwill was written off 
of this amount  approximately related to a reduction in the goodwill for the acquisition of tycho and approximately related to a reduction in the goodwill for our acquisition of certain assets of trusted net 
during the fourth quarter  we had an additional reduction in force of approximately employees 
this resulted in an additional restructuring charge for severance of approximately  which was partially offset by a reduction of approximately in previously reserved amounts related to the write down of certain fixed assets 
in addition  we re classified amounts previously reserved for equipment removal to estimated termination fees as we were successful in negotiating reduced fees for equipment removal at many of the closed central office locations 
in addition  our impairment analyses of long lived assets resulted in a impairment write off of a long term investment 
during  we charged approximately against our restructuring reserves 
of this amount  approximately related to payment of certain termination fees associated with the closure of certain central offices during  and approximately related to facilities expense associated with the company s vacated offices

dollars in thousands  except per share amounts our financial performance  when we achieve profitability or become cash flow positive will depend on a number of factors  including o development of the high speed data communications industry and our ability to compete effectively  o amount  timing and pricing of customer revenue  o availability  timing and pricing of acquisition opportunities  and our ability to capitalize on such opportunities  o commercial acceptance of our service and attaining expected penetration within our target markets  o our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel  o up front sales and marketing expenses  o cost and utilization of our network components which we lease from other telecommunications providers  including other competitive carriers  o our ability to establish and maintain relationships with marketing partners  o successful implementation and management of financial  information management and operations support systems to efficiently and cost effectively manage our operations and growth  and o favorable outcome of federal and state regulatory proceedings and related judicial proceedings  including proceedings relating to the telecommunications act and the federal communications commissions triennial review order 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our business plan objectives or that we will achieve or maintain cash flow positive operating results 
if we are unable to generate adequate funds from our operations  we may not be able to continue to operate our network  respond to competitive pressures or fund our operations 
as a result  we may be required to significantly reduce  reorganize  discontinue or shut down our operations 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty 
our independent auditors have raised questions about our ability to continue as a going concern in their report on our audited financial statements  which may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise additional capital and on our stock price our independent accountants have included in their report on our audited financial statements an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern 
this explanatory paragraph includes the following language the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  the company has experienced sustained operating losses that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in note the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
the inclusion of this dollars in thousands  except per share amounts explanatory paragraph in the report of our independent accountants may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise additional capital and on our stock price 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue as a going concern 
additional financing will be required in if we are to achieve our accelerated growth objectives through strategic acquisitions additional financing will be required during if we are to achieve our accelerated growth objectives through strategic acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional financing through some combination of borrowings  leasing  vendor financing and the sale of equity or debt securities 
our failure to raise additional financing may hamper our ability to accelerate our growth and may have an adverse impact on our stock price 
because the high speed data communications industry continues to rapidly evolve  we cannot predict its future growth or ultimate size the high speed data communications industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change 
because the technologies available for high speed data communications services are rapidly evolving  we cannot accurately predict the rate at which the market for our services will grow  if at all  or whether emerging technologies will render our services less competitive or obsolete 
if the market for our services fails to develop or grows more slowly than anticipated  our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
many providers of high speed data communication services are testing products from numerous suppliers for various applications 
our business model is unproven  and may not be successful we do not know whether our business model and strategy will be successful 
if the assumptions underlying our business model are not valid or we are unable to implement our business plan  achieve the predicted level of market penetration or obtain the desired level of pricing of our services for sustained periods  our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we have adopted a different strategy than certain other broadband internet service providers and dsl providers 
we focus on selling directly to small and medium sized businesses and branch offices of larger businesses and their remote office users 
our unproven business model makes it difficult to predict the extent to which our services will achieve market acceptance 
it is possible that our efforts will not result in significant market penetration  favorable operating results or profitability 
if our services fail to achieve or sustain market acceptance at desired pricing levels  our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow would be impaired prices for digital communication services have fallen historically 
accordingly  we cannot predict to what extent we may need to reduce our prices to remain competitive or whether we will be able to sustain future pricing levels as our competitors introduce competing services or similar services at lower prices 
if our services fail to achieve or sustain market acceptance at desired pricing levels  our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow would be impaired  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
dollars in thousands  except per share amounts we may be subject to risks associated with acquisitions we may not be able to compete successfully for acquisition opportunities  operate the acquired assets or businesses profitably or otherwise implement successfully our acquisition strategy 
we have made a number of asset and business acquisitions 
we intend to continue to seek additional opportunities for further acquisitions  which we believe represents a distinct market opportunity to accelerate growth 
we continuously identify and evaluate acquisition candidates and in many cases engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions 
our discussions and negotiations may not result in any acquisitions 
there is significant competition for acquisition opportunities in our business 
as the consolidation in our industry continues  this competition may intensify and increase the costs of capitalizing on such opportunities 
we compete for acquisition opportunities with companies that have significantly greater financial and management resources 
also  all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition may be paid in cash  thus depleting our cash resources 
in addition  an acquisition  may not produce the revenue  earnings  cash flows or business synergies that we anticipate  and an acquired asset or business might not perform as we anticipated 
any such event may delay the time at which we expect to achieve profitability or positive cash flows 
further  if we pursue any future acquisition  our management could spend a significant amount of time and effort in identifying and completing the acquisition and may be distracted from the operation of our business 
we will also have to devote a significant amount of management resources to integrating any acquired businesses  with our existing operations  and that may not be successful 
our management team is critical and the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business in the last four months  two officers from our management team have left the company to pursue other opportunities 
we depend on a small number of executive officers and other members of senior management to work effectively as a team  to execute our business strategy and business plan  and to manage employees located in several locations across the united states 
the loss of key managers or their failure to work effectively as a team could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we can not guarantee that our key employees will desire to continue their employment with the company over any period of time and thus there is the risk that any or all of these individuals may seek employment opportunities with other employers at any time 
further  there is no assurance that we will be able to attract highly qualified employees  as we have in the past  to replace key personnel in the future 
our failure to maintain the necessary infrastructure to support our business and to manage our growth could strain our resources and adversely affect our business and financial performance we have had significant growth in the number of markets in which we provide service and the number of customers subscribing for our services 
this growth has placed a significant strain on our management  financial controls  operations  personnel and other resources 
we have deployed operations support systems to help manage customer service  bill customers  process customer orders and coordinate with vendors and contractors 
subsequent integration and enhancement of these systems could be delayed or cause disruptions in service or billing 
to efficiently and cost effectively manage our geographically dispersed business  we must continue to successfully implement these systems on a timely basis  and continually expand and upgrade these systems as our operations expand 
dollars in thousands  except per share amounts if we fail to retain our employees or recruit qualified personnel in a timely manner  we will not be able to execute our business plan and our business will be harmed to execute our business plan  we need to hire and retain qualified personnel  particularly sales and marketing  engineering and other technical personnel 
if we are unable to retain our employees or recruit qualified personnel in a timely manner  we will not be able to execute our business plan 
the reductions in workforce that we have made since  and the competitive nature of our industry  may make it difficult to hire qualified personnel on a timely basis and to retain our employees 
disappointing quarterly revenue  operating results or operating statistics could cause the price of our common stock to fall our quarterly revenue  operating results and operating statistics are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our quarterly revenue  operating results or operating statistics fall below the expectations of investors or security analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
our quarterly revenue  operating results and operating statistics may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control  including o the timing and success of acquisitions  if any  o the timing of the rollout of our services and any additional infrastructure  and the amount and timing of expenditures relating thereto  o regulatory developments  o the rate at which we are able to attract customers and our ability to retain these customers at sufficient aggregate revenue levels  o the availability of financing  o technical difficulties or network service interruptions  and o the introduction of new services or technologies by our competitors and resulting pressures on the pricing of our service 
the failure of our customers to pay their bills on a timely basis could adversely affect our cash flow our target customers consist mostly of small and medium sized businesses 
we bill and collect numerous relatively small customer accounts 
we may experience difficulty in collecting amounts due on a timely basis 
in addition  with the acquisition of the network access solutions assets on january   we acquired a number of end users that we service indirectly through various internet service providers 
we sell our services to such internet service providers who then resell such services 
we therefore expect to have increased exposure and concentration of credit risk pertaining to such internet service providers during and beyond 
our failure to collect accounts receivable owed to us by our customers on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and cash flow 
dollars in thousands  except per share amounts we depend on wholesale dsl and t providers  some of whom are competitors  to provide us with local facilities in areas where we have not deployed our own equipment in markets where we have not deployed our own local dsl and t equipment  we utilize local facilities from wholesale providers  including covad communications  in order to provide service to our end user customers 
in these cases  we are dependent upon these wholesale carriers to provide  or arrange the provision of  the equipment and on site wiring required to provide local dsl or t services to our end user customers  as well as to provide and maintain the local dsl or t line 
in general  these carriers may terminate the service they provide to us with little or no notice 
these carriers may not continue to provide us with acceptable local services for our customers on the scale  at the price levels and within the time frames we require  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain acceptable services from these wholesale carriers or they terminate the service they provide us  we may be required to install our own equipment in a central office and provide and install new equipment for our customers  or arrange for another wholesale carrier to do so 
obtaining space and provisioning equipment in a new central office is a lengthy and costly process 
we cannot assure you that we  or another carrier with whom we work  would be able to obtain the space required in a central office on a cost effective basis  if at all  or that we could provide services to such customers on a timely basis 
our failure to install and provide services to customers on a timely basis  or the disruption in the services provided to our customers  would likely result in the loss of many  if not all  of the customers in the affected locations  and could result in claims brought by these customers against us 
this could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  business  results of operations  financial position and prospects 
certain wholesale providers with whom we work offer services that compete with ours  or have other customers whose services compete with ours 
such competing interests may affect the ability or willingness of these providers to provide us with acceptable services on acceptable terms 
in addition  certain of these providers are relatively young companies that are facing substantial operational and financial challenges 
the operational success and abilities of these carriers to operate their businesses could materially affect our business 
the failure of any of these companies could cause us to lose customers and revenue  expose us to claims and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  business  results of operations  financial position and prospects 
our services are subject to federal  state and local regulation  and changes in laws or regulations could adversely affect the way we operate our business the facilities we use and the services we offer are subject to varying degrees of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
changes in applicable laws or regulations could  among other things  increase our costs  restrict our access to the network elements and central offices of the traditional local telephone companies  or restrict our ability to provide our services 
for example  the telecommunications act  which  among other things  requires traditional local telephone companies to unbundle network elements and to allow competitors to locate their equipment in the traditional local telephone companies central offices  is the subject of ongoing proceedings at the federal and state levels  litigation in federal and state courts  and legislation in federal and state legislatures 
for example  the order that the federal communications commission the fcc may ultimately promulgate pursuant to the telecommunications act  including rules established in response to judicial activity  may change  reduce  or even eliminate the obligation of the traditional local telephone companies to provide various network elements to competitors such as us for use for high speed data services 
in addition  various pending or potential legislative proposals in congress and state legislatures could  if adopted  also dollars in thousands  except per share amounts have the effect of reducing the obligations of the traditional local telephone companies on which we rely 
adoption of such legislation  or of some of the regulatory changes being considered by the fcc  could have severe adverse consequences for our business 
we cannot predict the outcome of the various proceedings  litigation and legislation or whether or to what extent these proceedings  litigation and legislation may adversely affect our business and operations 
decisions by the fcc and state telecommunications regulators will determine  revise and or reaffirm some of the terms of our relationships with traditional telecommunications carriers  including the terms and prices of services provided under our interconnection agreements  and access fees and surcharges on gross revenue from interstate and intrastate services 
state telecommunications regulators determine whether and on what terms we will be authorized to operate as a competitive local exchange carrier in their state 
in addition  local municipalities may require us to obtain various permits that could increase the cost of services or delay development of our network 
future federal  state and local regulations and legislation may be less favorable to us than current regulations and legislation and may adversely affect our businesses and operations 
see item business governmental regulations 
our success depends on negotiating and entering into interconnection agreements with traditional local telephone companies we must enter into and renew interconnection agreements with traditional local telephone companies in each market in which we deploy our own equipment 
these agreements govern  among other things  the price and other terms regarding our location of equipment in the traditional local telephone companies offices  known as central offices  and our lease of copper telephone lines that connect those central offices to our customers 
we have entered into agreements with bellsouth  cincinnati bell  frontier  sbc communications  qwest  sprint and verizon  or their subsidiaries  which govern our relationships in states and the district of columbia 
delays in obtaining or renewing interconnection agreements would delay our entrance into new markets or impact our operations in existing markets  and could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
in addition  disputes have arisen  and will likely arise in the future  regarding the interpretation of these interconnection agreements 
these disputes have  in the past  delayed the deployment of our network 
our interconnection agreements generally have limited terms of one to two years and we cannot assure you that new agreements will be negotiated on a timely basis  if at all  or that existing agreements will be extended on terms favorable to us 
interconnection agreements must be approved by state regulators and are also subject to oversight by the fcc and the courts 
these governmental authorities may modify the terms or prices of our interconnection agreements in ways that could adversely affect our ability to deliver service and our business and results of operations 
failure to negotiate interconnection agreements with the traditional local telephone companies could lead to costly and lengthy arbitration which may not be resolved in our favor under federal law  traditional local telephone companies have an obligation to negotiate our interconnection agreements in good faith 
if no agreement can be reached  either side may petition the applicable state telecommunications regulators to arbitrate remaining disagreements 
arbitration is a costly and lengthy process that could delay our entry into markets and could harm our ability to compete 
interconnection agreements resulting from arbitration must be approved by state regulators 
we cannot assure you that a state regulatory authority would resolve disputes in our favor 
dollars in thousands  except per share amounts our success depends on traditional local telephone companies providing acceptable transmission facilities and copper telephone lines we interconnect with and use the networks of traditional local telephone companies to provide services to our customers in the markets where we have deployed our own equipment 
in markets where we utilize the local facilities of other carriers to provide our service  those carriers must interconnect with and use the networks of traditional local telephone companies to provide this service 
we cannot assure you that these networks will be able to meet the telecommunications needs of our customers or maintain our service standards 
we also depend on the traditional local telephone companies to provide and maintain their transmission facilities and the copper telephone lines between our network and our customers premises 
the fcc s decision in february to exempt the traditional local telephone companies from their obligation to provide access to certain loop transmission facilities that use fiber or new technologies to competitors such as us may motivate the traditional local telephone companies to modify  characterize or replace their facilities in ways that would qualify them for this exemption and thereby preclude us from accessing those facilities 
our dependence on traditional local telephone companies could cause delays in establishing our network and providing our services 
any such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we  and the other competitive carriers with which we work  lease copper telephone lines running from the central office of the traditional local telephone companies to each customer s location 
in many cases  the copper telephone lines must be specially conditioned by the telephone company to carry digital signals 
we may not be able to obtain a sufficient number of acceptable telephone lines on acceptable terms  if at all 
traditional telephone companies often rely on unionized labor and labor related issues have in the past  and may in the future  adversely affect the services provided by the traditional telephone companies 
we compete with the traditional local telephone companies on which we depend most of the traditional local telephone companies  including those created by at t s divestiture of its local telephone service business  offer dsl based services 
in addition  these companies also currently offer high speed data communications services that use other technologies  including t services 
consequently  these companies have certain incentives to delay o our entry into  and renewals of  interconnection agreements with them  o our access to their central offices to install our equipment and provide our services  o provisioning of acceptable transmission facilities and copper telephone lines on our behalf  and o our introduction and expansion of various services 
any such delays could negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan and harm our competitive position  business and prospects 
in addition  the other carriers whose local facilities we utilize in markets where we have not deployed our own equipment also compete with the traditional local telephone companies and rely on these companies for the same facilities and services that we do 
any delay in the provision of acceptable transmission facilities and copper telephone lines provided by the dollars in thousands  except per share amounts traditional local telephone companies to these carriers which are used in the provision of our service could negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan and harm our competitive position  business and prospects 
competition from the traditional local telephone companies offering dsl  t or other competitive high speed data communications services in a specific market may adversely impact our ability to obtain customers in that area and harm our competitive position  business and prospects 
these companies have established brand names and reputations for quality in their service areas  possess a large  existing customer base to whom they can market their various products and services  possess sufficient capital to deploy broadband equipment rapidly  have their own copper telephone lines and can bundle digital data services with their existing voice services to achieve a competitive advantage in serving customers 
in addition  we depend upon these traditional local telephone companies to provide us access to their central offices and to individual elements of their networks 
as a result  they can significantly influence the actual and perceived reliability  quality and timeliness of our services in their service areas 
the perceived relative stability of the traditional local telephone companies  particularly in light of the failure of certain competitive telephone companies and the financial and operational issues surrounding other such companies  provides the traditional local telephone companies a significant competitive advantage 
we depend on long distance carriers to connect our network data is transmitted across our network via transmission facilities that we lease from long distance carriers  including level communications and mci 
failure of these carriers to provide service or to provide quality service may interrupt the use of our services by our customers 
the service provided by these carriers has been interrupted in the past  which has affected the services we provide to our customers 
we cannot be sure that this service will not be interrupted in the future 
in addition  mci has filed a voluntary petition to reorganize under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
while mci has continued with its current operations since filing its voluntary petition to reorganize in june  and has announced that it expects to continue with its current operations without adverse impact on its customers  it may not be able to do so 
we believe that we could transition the data transport services currently supplied by mci to alternative suppliers in thirty to sixty days  should mci announce discontinuance of such services 
however  were mci to discontinue such services without providing sufficient advance notice at least sixty days  we might not be able to transition such services in a timely manner  which could disrupt service provided by us to certain of our customers 
this could result in the loss of revenue  loss of customers  claims brought against us by our customers  or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 
even were mci to provide adequate notice of any such discontinuation of service  there can be no assurance that we would be able to transition such service without a material adverse impact on us or our customers  if at all  or that such discontinuation of service would not otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 
intense competition in the high speed data communication services market may negatively affect the number of our customers and the pricing of our services the high speed data communication services market is intensely competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we expect the level of competition to intensify in the future  due  in part  to increasing consolidation in our industry 
our competitors use various high dollars in thousands  except per share amounts speed communications technologies for local access connections such as integrated services digital network  or isdn  frame relay  t  dsl services and wireless  satellite based and cable networks 
we expect significant competition from o other providers of dsl and t services  including covad communications  and new edge networks  o internet service providers  such as uunet  earthlink and megapath  which offer high speed access capabilities  as well as other related products and services  o traditional local telephone companies  including the traditional local telephone companies created by at t s divestiture of its local telephone service business  which deploy dsl and t services and which provide other high speed data communications services  o competitive carriers offering their own integrated voice and data services  including cbeyond communications  llc and dsli  o national long distance carriers  such as at t  sprint  williams and mci  some of which are offering competitive dsl and t services and other high speed data communications services  o cable modem service providers  such as time warner cable  comcast and rcn  which are offering high speed internet access over cable networks  and o providers utilizing alternative technologies  such as fiber optic  wireless and satellite based data service providers 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand name recognition  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  management  service support and other resources than we do 
therefore  they may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
see item business competition 
our failure to develop and maintain good relationships with marketing partners in a local service market could adversely affect our ability to obtain and retain customers in that market in addition to marketing through our direct sales force  we rely on relationships with local marketing partners  such as integrators of computer systems and networks and consultants 
these partners recommend our services to their clients  provide us with referrals and help us build a local presence in each market 
we may not be able to identify  and maintain good relationships with  quality marketing partners and we cannot assure you that they will recommend our services rather than our competitors services to their customers 
our failure to identify and maintain good relationships with quality marketing partners could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and retain customers in a market and  as a result  our business would suffer 
uncertain tax and other surcharges on our services may increase our payment obligations to federal and state governments telecommunications providers are subject to a variety of federal and state surcharges and dollars in thousands  except per share amounts fees on their gross revenues from interstate and intrastate services 
these surcharges and fees may be increased and other surcharges and fees not currently applicable to our services could be imposed on us 
in either case  the cost of our services would increase and that could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
a system failure could delay or interrupt service to our customers our operations depend upon our ability to support a highly complex network infrastructure and avoid damage from fires  earthquakes  floods  power losses  excessive sustained or peak user demand  telecommunications failures  network software flaws  computer worms and viruses  transmission cable cuts and similar events 
the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated interruption of service at our owned or leased facilities could cause interruptions in our services 
in addition  failure of a traditional telephone company  competitive telecommunications company or other service provider to provide communications capacity or other services that we require  as a result of a natural disaster or other unanticipated interruptions  operational disruption or any other reason  could cause interruptions in our services 
any damage or failure that causes sustained interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a breach of our network security could result in liability to us and deter customers from using our services our network may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses and other disruptive problems 
any of the foregoing problems could result in liability to us and deter customers from using our service 
unauthorized access could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in the computer systems of our customers 
eliminating computer viruses and alleviating other security problems may require interruptions  delays or cessation of service to our customers  cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the problem  and divert management s attention 
we can provide no assurance that the security measures we have implemented will not be circumvented or that any failure of these measures will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and retain customers 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect our business we rely on unpatented trade secrets and know how to maintain our competitive position 
our inability to protect these secrets and know how could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants and business partners 
these agreements may be breached or terminated 
in addition  third parties  including our competitors  may assert infringement claims against us 
any of such claims could result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  and require us to pay damages and or to enter into license or similar agreements under which we could be required to pay license fees or royalties 
we may be exposed to liability for information carried over our network or displayed on web sites that we host because we provide connections to the internet and host web sites for our customers  we may be perceived as being associated with the content carried over our network or displayed on web sites that we host 
we do not and cannot screen all of this content 
as a result  we may face dollars in thousands  except per share amounts potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the content carried over our network or displayed on web sites that we host 
these types of claims have been brought against providers of online services in the past and can be costly to defend regardless of the merit of the lawsuit 
the protection offered by recent federal legislation that protects online services from some claims when the material is written by third parties is limited 
further  the law in this area remains in flux and varies from state to state 
we may also suffer a loss of customers or reputational harm based on this content or resulting from our involvement in these legal proceedings 
we may incur significant amounts of debt in the future to implement our business plan and  if incurred  this indebtedness will create greater financial and operating risk and limit our flexibility we issued  in notes in july those notes contain provisions that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and place other restrictions on our business 
we may seek additional debt financing in the future 
we may not be able to repay any current or future debt 
if we incur additional debt  we will be required to devote increased amounts of our cash flow to service indebtedness 
this could require us to modify  delay or abandon the capital expenditures and other investments necessary to implement our business plan 
risks relating to ownership of our common stock our stock price could fluctuate widely in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
our stock price could fluctuate widely in response to factors such as the following o actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or operating statistics or our financial condition  o announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors or new competing technologies  o the addition or loss of customers  o changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  o conditions or trends in the telecommunications industry  including regulatory or legislative developments  o growth of internet and on line commerce usage and the internet and on line commerce industries  o announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  o additions or departures of our key personnel  o the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq smallcap market  dollars in thousands  except per share amounts o future equity or debt financings by us or our announcements of such financings  and o general market and economic conditions 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the market for internet  technology and telecommunications companies in particular  have experienced large price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect our stock price  regardless of our operating performance 
our common stock may be de listed from the nasdaq smallcap market  which may have a material adverse impact on the pricing and trading of our common stock on july   the nasdaq stock market  inc nasdaq transferred the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
we applied for such transfer as a result of our non compliance with nasdaq s marketplace rule a  which required us to maintain a minimum bid price of per share for at least consecutive trading days during the last ninety day period prior to july  in order to remain qualified for listing on the nasdaq national market 
on october   nasdaq notified us that  while we had not regained compliance by october  with the minimum bid price per share requirement generally required for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  we did continue to meet the initial listing requirements for the nasdaq smallcap market under rule c a 
as a result  we were afforded an additional calendar days  or until april   to comply with the minimum bid price of per share for consecutive trading days  or such greater number of trading days as nasdaq may have determined  in order to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
on march   nasdaq amended its rules to provide that a company that satisfies the initial listing requirements for the nasdaq smallcap market under rule c a would have an additional days over the days already contemplated by the nasdaq smallcap market rules to comply with the minimum bid price of per share 
on april   nasdaq notified us that  while we had not regained compliance by april  with the minimum bid price per share requirement generally required for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  we did continue to meet the initial listing requirements for the nasdaq smallcap market under rule c a 
as a result  we were afforded an additional calendar days  or until july   to comply with the minimum bid price of per share for consecutive trading days  or such greater number of trading days as nasdaq may have determined  in order to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
on july   we received notification from the nasdaq staff indicating that our common stock failed to comply with the closing bid price per share requirement for consecutive trading days as set forth in the nasdaq s marketplace rule c and as such our common stock was subject to delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market 
we appealed this determination to a listings qualifications panel and were subsequently granted an extension until november   to comply with the minimum bid price of per share for a minimum of consecutive days 
on october   nasdaq notified us that we had been granted an additional extension until december  to gain compliance with the minimum bid price rule pending sec action on certain nasdaq proposed rule changes discussed below 
on december   nasdaq notified us that we had been granted an additional extension until january  to gain compliance with the minimum bid price rule 
this extension was granted to allow for further developments in the pending sec action on certain nasdaq rule changes discussed below 
on december   the sec approved certain modifications to nasdaq s bid price requirements  and nasdaq subsequently notified us on january  that we had been granted an additional dollars in thousands  except per share amounts extension until april  to gain compliance with the minimum bid price rule as set forth in nasdaq s newly amended marketplace rule c d discussed below 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
nasdaq has submitted proposed rule changes to the sec which would  among other things  modify the grace periods for companies trying to come into compliance with the bid price requirements for continued listing 
on december   the sec approved certain modifications to nasdaq s bid price requirements 
under the amended marketplace rule c d  the company has until april  to trade at or above per share for a minimum of consecutive trading days  or  if the bid price deficiency is not remedied by that date  to take steps for implementation of a reverse stock split in order to continue its smallcap market listing 
our stockholders approved a reverse stock split at a ratio to be determined by the board of directors within a range from one for two to one for twenty for this purpose at the annual meeting of stockholders held on october  if implemented  a reverse stock split could impact the trading value of your shares and may not result in our continued compliance with applicable listing requirements  either in the short or long term 
certain investors have significant influence regarding most matters requiring stockholder approval  which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
as of march   a group of private investment funds affiliated with vantagepoint venture partners owns of record approximately  shares of our outstanding common stock and  shares of our outstanding series x preferred stock  which represented approximately of the combined voting power of all issued and outstanding capital stock of the company 
in addition  that group owns warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock
