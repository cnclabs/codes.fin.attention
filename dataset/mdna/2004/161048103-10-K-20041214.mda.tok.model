item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto of the company included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks relating to our business in this section 
overview we were founded in and opened our first store in carlsbad  california 
in september  two funds managed by saunders karp megrue partners  llc  a private equity firm  together with bernard zeichner  acquired the business 
mr 
zeichner undertook several strategic initiatives for a national new store expansion program  including hiring a number of other senior executives with national retail experience  and upgrading our information systems  distribution systems and facilities 
in september  we launched our second distinct retail concept by acquiring stores and a license to use the rampage name on retail stores 
in august  we further enhanced our management team with the addition of mark hoffman as chief operating officer 
mr 
hoffman began a strategic evaluation of our infrastructure needs  including senior management  systems  distribution facilities and merchandising strategy 
in july  mr 
hoffman was promoted to chief executive officer  and mr 
zeichner became chairman of the board of directors 
in the five fiscal years ended september   we grew from stores to stores  representing a compound annual growth rate of  and increased our annual revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we experienced successive quarters of comparable store sales declines through the first quarter of fiscal that resulted in a decline in average annual sales per store 
as a result  beginning in late fiscal  we began to initiate a series of management and operational changes intended to improve our merchandise assortments  in store presentation and financial performance 
our sales trends improved during the second and third quarters of fiscal which contributed to improved profitability 
during the fourth quarter ending in september  however  sales slowed down as offerings at the charlotte russe stores failed to reflect enough wear now summer fashion due to an early conversion to early fall assortments 
at the same time  the repositioning of the rampage brand had become more difficult as more of the merchandise reflected elevated initial retail prices and corresponding elevations of product quality  fabrication  fit and detailing 
management acknowledged that it would take time to attract targeted customers to the elevated assortments  and it estimated that the rampage stores would continue to experience negative comparable sales trends during the first half of fiscal sales for october and november  the first two months of the first quarter of fiscal  have been disappointing 
offerings at the charlotte russe stores have not met with customer acceptance and the anticipated progression of improvements at the rampage stores has not materialized 
the negative comparable store sales trend that re emerged in the fourth quarter of fiscal is expected to continue through the first quarter of fiscal with the resulting decline in average store volumes  significant pressure on operating margins is expected and earnings for the first quarter of fiscal are expected to be down sharply from the prior year levels 
in addition  donna desrosiers  general merchandise manager for the charlotte russe chain  resigned effective december  we have initiated an executive search for her replacement 
results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of sales  and store information for the periods indicated 
fiscal year net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses store closing costs operating income interest income  net other charges  net income before income taxes income taxes net income number of stores open at end of period fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net sales 
our net sales increased to million from million  an increase of  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase reflects million of additional net sales from the new stores opened during fiscal as well as other stores opened in prior fiscal years that did not qualify as comparable stores 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales  which resulted in decreased sales of million compared to the prior fiscal year 
gross profit 
gross profit represents net sales less cost of goods sold  which includes buying  distribution and occupancy costs 
our gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily the result of higher net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to from 
the increase as a percentage of net sales was principally due to improved product gross margins as higher initial markup more than offset a higher markdown expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was attributable to new store expansion and increased corporate expenses  specifically higher store payroll and operating expenses and higher central office payroll and related expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to from primarily due to higher store payroll expenses 
store closing costs 
fiscal includes a pre tax reversal of  of costs previously incurred in fiscal associated with the closure of charlotte s room stores 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate of approximates our statutory income tax rates 
net income 
our net income increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year

gross profit 
gross profit represents net sales less cost of goods sold  which includes buying  distribution and occupancy costs 
our gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was the result of higher net sales  offset in part by decreased gross profit margins 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to from 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was principally due to higher occupancy expenses as these relatively fixed charges were spread over a smaller average store sales base 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was attributable to new store expansion and increased corporate expenses  specifically higher store payroll and operating expenses and higher central office payroll and related expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to from primarily due to higher store operating expenses as these charges were spread over a smaller average store sales base

no such charges were incurred in the prior fiscal year 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate of approximates our statutory income tax rates 
net income 
our net income decreased to million from million  a decrease of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales  an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  store closing costs  offset by a decrease in income taxes 
quarterly results and seasonality we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
as is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise  our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized by strong sales during the back to school  easter and winter holiday seasons 
the strength of each of these three seasons generally provides relatively balanced sales during our first  third and fourth fiscal quarters 
we typically experience lower net sales and net income during the second quarter of each fiscal year 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays  as well as other factors discussed in the section entitled risks relating to our business 
the following table includes our unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters during the two year period ended september  this data has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements 
we believe that this information has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and that all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

our capital requirements result primarily from capital expenditures related to new store openings 
we have historically satisfied our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operations  although we have also used borrowings under prior credit facilities in the past for acquisitions  including our acquisition and the acquisition of the rampage stores 
due to the rapid turnover of our inventory  we generate trade payables and other accrued liabilities sufficient to offset most  if not all  of our working capital requirements  and this allows us to generally operate with limited working capital 
as of september   we had working capital of approximately million which included cash and cash equivalents of million 
during fiscal years  and  our net cash provided by operations amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal year  our net cash provided by operations increased as a result of higher net income than in the prior fiscal year and changes in working capital accounts 
our net cash used in investing activities amounted to approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the primary component related to purchases of fixed assets  which consists of new store openings  the upgrade of our information systems and other corporate expenditures 
we opened a total of  and new stores during the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal year as compared to fiscal primarily relates to the million expenditure in fiscal for the ontario distribution center 
we expect to continue to invest in capital to support our growth 
based on our experience with store openings for our two concepts  we estimate that the average net investment to open these new stores is approximately  which includes capital expenditures  net of landlord contributions  and initial inventory  net of payables 
all new stores opened since our acquisition that have operated for more than one year generated average net sales of approximately million and store level operating cash flow in excess of  or approximately of net sales 
accordingly  these stores generated an average cash return on investment of approximately in their first year of operation 
for the stores opened in fiscal and  we achieved average net sales of million per store and store level operating cash flow of approximately  or of net sales 
this group of newer stores generated an average cash return on investment of approximately in their first year of operations 
in light of recent economic conditions  we are targeting future store openings that will generate  on average  cash returns on investment in excess of for the first year of operation 
after taking into account new store construction  existing store remodeling  distribution center expenditures  and other corporate capital projects  total capital expenditures for fiscal year are projected to range from approximately to million 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to approximately million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
financing activities primarily consist of the proceeds of stock option exercises 
effective february   we obtained a million unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america  na to replace a previous million unsecured revolving credit facility with another lender 
the new facility  as amended  is subject to certain restrictions and covenants and expires on march  interest on the revolving credit facility is payable quarterly  at the company s option  at either i the bank s base rate  as defined  or ii the bank s eurodollar rate plus  subject to certain adjustments 
at september   there was no outstanding debt under the revolving credit facility 
the agreement requires that the company maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis  sets limits on stock repurchases and capital spending and restricts future liens and indebtedness  sales of assets and dividend payments 
as of september   we were in compliance with the terms of the bank credit agreement 
we believe that cash flows from operations  our current cash balance and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and contemplated capital expenditure requirements for fiscal if our cash flow from operations should decline significantly  it may be necessary for us to seek additional sources of capital 
letters of credit pursuant to the terms of the unsecured revolving credit facility  the company can issue up to million of documentary or standby letters of credit 
the outstanding commitments under this agreement at september  totaled approximately million  including million in standby letters of credit 
contractual obligations the company s commitment to make future payments under long term contractual obligations was as follows  as of september  contractual obligations total less than year years years after years dollars in thousands operating leases other long term obligations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments regarding inventories  receivables  fixed assets  intangible assets  accrued liabilities  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results from this evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  alternative estimates and judgments could be derived which would differ from the estimates being used by management 
actual results could differ from any or all of these estimates 
as a retailer of women s apparel and accessories  our financial statements are affected by several critical accounting policies  many of which affect management s use of estimates and judgments  as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we sell merchandise directly to retail customers and recognize revenue at the point of sale 
customers have the right to return merchandise to us  and we maintain a reserve for the financial impact of returns which occur subsequent to the current reporting period 
our merchandise is initially offered for sale at a regular price  but is often marked down prior to the ultimate sale of all such units 
we utilize the retail method of accounting for our inventory valuation that inherently reduces the inventories carrying value as markdowns are initiated 
in addition  we maintain a reserve for the financial impact of markdowns that we believe are likely to be encountered in the future 
if actual demand or market conditions are more or less favorable than those projected by management  the level of the reserve for future markdowns would be subject to change in subsequent reporting periods 
we also provide for estimated inventory losses for damaged  lost or stolen inventory for the period from the last physical inventory to the financial statement date 
these estimates are based on historical experience and other factors 
we have recorded a goodwill asset that arose from the acquisition of our business in september this asset is tested for possible impairment on at least an annual basis in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
the carrying value of investments in our stores  principally leasehold improvements and equipment  and other operations is reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in prior years  we established reserves for stores which have been closed  and no other stores are contemplated for closure at this time 
during fiscal  we decided to exit the charlotte s room concept and closed charlotte s room stores 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company recorded a liability of million and recognized an impairment charge of million for total store closing costs of million  before the effect of income taxes 
the final settlement of charges is currently estimated to be  accordingly   and  was reversed into income during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the second quarter of fiscal  respectively 
the million impairment charge reflected the difference between the carrying value and fair value of charlotte s room assets 
fair value was based on estimated market valuations for those assets since their carrying value was not anticipated to be recoverable through future cash flows 
these assets were disposed of during the third quarter at approximately the estimated fair value 
the asset impairment charge of million is included in the million shown in the store closing costs line item on the accompanying statement of income for the fiscal year ended september  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit of disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
we applied the provisions of sfas no 
for exit or disposal activities that initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
results in recognizing the cost of future restructuring activities over a period of time rather than in one reporting period 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb concluded that the proposed statement r  share based payment  would be effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june   thereby  becoming effective beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the company 
as currently proposed  statement r would require all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized as an operating expense in the income statement 
the cost would be recognized over the requisite service period based on fair values measured on grant dates 
the fasb has tentatively concluded that the new standard may be adopted using either the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
the final standard is expected to be issued during december  and  we are currently evaluating our share based employee compensation programs  potential impact of this statement on our consolidated financial position and results of operations  and alternative adoption methods which may be available 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective for the first interim period beginning after june   with certain exceptions 
we adopted sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates 
we bear this risk in two specific ways 
first  our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our statement of income and our cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of september   we had no borrowings against our credit facility 
however  we may borrow additional funds under our revolving credit facility as needed 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are considered to be cash equivalents and are shown that way on our balance sheet 
if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we believe our market risk exposure is immaterial 
forward looking statements we have made statements under the captions  business  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and risks relating to our business  as well as in other sections of this annual report on form k  that are forward looking statements 
you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as may  will  expect  intend  anticipate  believe  estimate and continue or similar words 
these forward looking statements may also use different phrases 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events 
these forward looking statements  which are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions about us  may include  among other things  projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition  our anticipated growth strategies  successful repositioning of our rampage brand  integration of our recently hired senior executives  and general and regional economic conditions  industry trends  consumer demands and preferences  competition from other retailers and uncertainties generally associated with women s apparel and accessory retailing 
there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or which we do not fully control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements 
because these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements  including shopping mall traffic and shopping patterns  timing of openings for new shopping malls or our stores  fashion trends  national or regional economic influences  and weather 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this annual report on form k might not occur 
risks relating to our business we intend to continue to open new stores  which could strain our resources and cause us to operate our business less effectively 
our growth will largely depend on successfully opening and operating new stores 
during fiscal  we opened new stores representing a increase from the number of stores open at the end of fiscal we plan to open up to new charlotte russe and rampage stores during fiscal  an increase of from total stores opened as of september  we intend to continue to increase our number of charlotte russe and rampage stores by approximately to per year for at least the next several years 
in order to support our planned expansion we will need to continually monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems 
this expansion also will place increased demand on our managerial  operational  and administrative resources 
these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less effectively  which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our individual stores and slow our new store growth 
our planned expansion involves a number of risks that could prevent or delay the successful opening of new stores as well as impact the performance of our existing stores 
our ability to open and operate new stores successfully depends on many factors  including  among others  our ability to identify suitable store locations  the availability of which is outside of our control  negotiate acceptable lease terms  including desired tenant improvement allowances  source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of new stores  hire  train and retain store personnel  successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations  and identify and satisfy the fashion preferences of new geographic areas 
in addition  many of our new stores will be opened in regions of the united states in which we currently have few or no stores 
the expansion into new markets may present competitive  merchandising and distribution challenges that are different from those currently encountered in our existing markets 
any of these challenges could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  to the extent our new store openings are in existing markets  we may experience reduced net sales volumes in existing stores in those markets 
the decline in general economic conditions has led to reduced consumer demand for our apparel and accessories 
consumer spending habits  including spending for the fashionable apparel and related accessories that we sell  are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
the general slowdown in the united states economy and the uncertain economic outlook has adversely affected consumer spending habits and mall traffic  which has resulted in  and may continue to result in  lower net sales than expected and has caused us to somewhat slow our expansion plans 
we are unlikely to return to our historical expansion rate until we achieve improved sales trends  and further erosion of sales trends could cause us to further delay or slow our expansion plans 
our success depends on our ability to identify and rapidly respond to consumer fashion tastes 
the apparel industry is subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends and shifting consumer demands 
accordingly  our success is heavily dependent both on the priority our target customers place on fashion and on our ability to anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends in a timely manner 
current fashion tastes place significant emphasis on a fashionable look 
in the past this emphasis has increased and decreased through fashion cycles and decreased emphasis has adversely affected our results 
if we do not anticipate  identify or react appropriately and timely to changes in styles  trends  desired images or brand preferences  it may lead to  among other things  excess inventories and higher markdowns  as well as decreased appeal of our brands 
our stores are heavily dependent on the customer traffic generated by shopping malls 
most of our store locations are not sufficiently concentrated to make significant marketing expenditures cost effective 
as a result  we depend heavily on locating our stores in prominent locations within successful shopping malls in order to generate customer traffic 
we cannot control the development of new shopping malls  the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls or the success of individual shopping malls 
our market share may be adversely impacted at any time by a significant number of competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by low barriers to entry 
we compete against a diverse group of retailers  including national and local specialty retail stores  regional retail chains  traditional department stores and  to a lesser extent  mass merchandisers 
our market share and results of operations may be adversely impacted by this significant number of competitors 
many of our competitors also are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do 
we rely on our good relationships with vendors to implement our business strategy successfully 
our business is dependent on continued good relations with our vendors 
in particular  we believe that we generally are able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors because we are perceived as a desirable customer 
our test and reorder merchandise strategy also relies in large part on our ability to obtain much of our merchandise from our vendors within three to six weeks from the date of order 
our failure to maintain good relations with our vendors could increase our exposure to changing fashion cycles  which may in turn lead to increased inventory markdown rates 
certain members of our senior management team have limited tenure with us 
our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization in order to timely deliver and display fashionable merchandise in appropriate quantities in our stores 
this execution requires experienced and talented management 
if we fail to attract  motivate and retain qualified and talented key personnel  it may adversely affect our business and inhibit our plans for future growth 
our chief executive officer recently assumed that role after approximately two years of service as our chief operations officer 
in addition  during fiscal we hired new general merchandise managers for our charlotte russe and rampage chains and three senior vice presidents for supply chain systems  store operations and real estate construction 
in december  the gmm for the charlotte russe chain resigned and an executive search is underway to find her replacement 
each of the other individuals has significant experience in these and similar roles with other apparel retailers  although they have limited tenure with our company 
if at any time our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations decline or do not meet the expectations of research analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
our quarterly results of operations for our individual stores have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
for instance  our quarterly comparable store sales percentages have ranged as high as positive and as low as negative over the past two years 
our net sales and operating results are typically lower in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to the traditional retail slowdown immediately following the winter holiday season 
our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings and the relative proportion of new stores to mature stores  efforts to reposition the targeted customer for our rampage stores  fashion trends  calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  the effectiveness of our test and reorder strategy in maintaining appropriate inventory levels  changes in our merchandise mix  timing of promotional events  general economic conditions and  in particular  the retail sales environment  actions by competitors or mall anchor tenants  weather conditions  and the level of pre opening expenses associated with new stores 
our business and reputation may be adversely affected if our rampage stores are associated with negative publicity related to the use of the rampage trademark by other parties 
in connection with the acquisition of our rampage stores  we acquired the exclusive right within the united states to use the rampage trademark on exterior and interior signage identifying our rampage stores  as well as the non exclusive right within the united states to use the rampage trademark for promotional and advertising materials 
we do not  however  have the right to use the rampage trademark on our merchandise 
the right to market merchandise under the rampage trademark was retained by rampage clothing company 
further  nothing in our license agreement with rampage clothing company prohibits the sale of merchandise bearing the rampage trademark by other parties or the licensing of the rampage trademark to other parties 
in fact  rampage clothing company has licensed the trademark to other parties 
we believe a positive rampage brand image is important to our success 
accordingly  if the merchandise sold by the rampage clothing company or other parties under the rampage trademark is of low quality or if the rampage clothing company or these parties otherwise engage in activities that negatively affect the rampage trademark or are otherwise inconsistent with our rampage store concept  consumers could lose confidence in our merchandise and our reputation and business could be materially adversely affected 
the failure to efficiently complete the planned replacement of certain of our technology and information systems could negatively impact our business 
the efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent on information systems 
in particular  we rely upon technology and information systems for inventory control and other critical information 
we periodically review  improve and  under certain circumstances  replace information systems to provide enhanced support to all operating areas 
if such upgrades and enhancements are not successfully implemented  then the current systems may not be able to continue to adequately support our information requirements 
we have recently initiated the replacement of our existing inventory software systems 
if we are unable to complete this conversion in an efficient and timely manner  our business could be negatively impacted 
our operations  as well as a substantial number of our stores  are concentrated in the southwest  which makes us susceptible to adverse conditions in this region 
our headquarters and distribution centers are located in california  and a substantial number of our stores are located in california and the southwest 
as a result  our business may be more susceptible to regional factors than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors 
these factors include  among others  economic and weather conditions  demographic and population changes  and fashion tastes 
further  a natural disaster or other catastrophic event  such as an earthquake affecting southern california  could significantly disrupt our operations 
the loss of  or disruption of operations in  either of our two distribution centers could negatively impact our business 
our merchandise is distributed through two modern facilities that use automated systems for sorting apparel and shipping merchandise 
we depend on the orderly operation of our facilities and distribution processes  as well as sufficient shipping resources 
disruptions in these operations due to fire  earthquake or other catastrophic events  employee matters including work stoppages  shipping problems or other events could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores 
the removal of quotas may adversely impact our business 
on january   in accordance with an agreement reached in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt ten years ago  the quota on textiles imported from china will be eliminated 
while the impact of the quota removal is uncertain  the increased access to the chinese textile market could create logistical delays arising from the surge of imported goods 
in addition  the quota removal may alter the cost differential between vendors that source domestically and vendors that more extensively import from china 
the effects of war or acts of terrorism could adversely affect our business 
the continued threat of terrorism  heightened security measures and military action in response to an act of terrorism has disrupted commerce and has intensified the uncertainty of the united states economy 
any further acts of terrorism  particularly directed at malls  or new or extended hostilities may disrupt commerce and undermine consumer confidence  which could negatively impact our sales by causing mall traffic or consumer spending to decline
