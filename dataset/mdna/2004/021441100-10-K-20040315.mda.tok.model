item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as information contained in risk factors below and elsewhere in this report  contains forward looking statements  which are provided under the safe harbor protection of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are generally written in the future tense and or are preceded by words such as will  may  should  could  expect  suggest  believe  anticipate  intend  plan  or other similar words 
forward looking statements include statements regarding our gross margins and factors that affect gross margins  such as the costs of raw materials  our ability to absorb manufacturing costs  trends in selling prices  and the sale of previously reserved inventory  the commercial success of our new products  the future availability of our announced products  trends in future sales  and future economic conditions 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements contained in this report are based on information that is currently available to us and expectations and assumptions that we deem reasonable at the time the statements were made 
we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statements in this report or in any of our other communications  except as required by law 
all such forward looking statements should be read as of the time the statements were made and with the recognition that these forward looking statements may not be complete or accurate at a later date 
many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
these factors include  but are not limited to  those risks set forth under risk factors 

index to financial statements critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
our management believes that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates and the financial statements and accompanying notes fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on our statement of operations and financial conditions 
critical accounting estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates include those regarding revenue recognition  the valuation of inventories  and taxes 
revenue recognition we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to oems  or their subcontract manufacturers 
we recognize revenue on products sold to oems upon shipment 
more than ninety five percent of our products are sold to distributors for subsequent resale to oems or their subcontract manufacturers 
because our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for product returns  price adjustments or  under certain circumstances  other credits  we defer recognition of revenue on products sold to distributors until the products are resold 
deferred revenue and the corresponding deferred cost of sales are recorded in the caption deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheets 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer on their shipments as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  we use this data and apply judgment in reconciling differences between their reported inventories and activities 
if distributors incorrectly report their inventories or activities  or if our judgment is in error  it could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues and income 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost on a first in first out basis approximated by standard cost or market 
we establish provisions for inventory if it is excess to projected customer demand  and the creation of such provisions results in a write down of inventory to net realizable value and a charge to cost of goods sold 
historically  it has been difficult to forecast customer demand especially at the part number level 
many of the orders we receive from our customers and distributors request delivery of product on relatively short notice and with lead times less than our manufacturing cycle time 
in order to provide competitive delivery times to our customers  we build and stock a certain amount of inventory in anticipation of customer demand that may not materialize 
moreover  as is common in the semiconductor industry  we may allow customers to cancel orders with minimal advance notice 
thus  even product built to satisfy specific customer orders may not ultimately be required to fulfill customer demand 
we routinely compare our inventory against projected demand and as a result frequently record immaterial inventory charges to provision for excess and obsolete inventories 
nevertheless  at any point in time  some portion of our inventory is subject to the risk of being materially in excess to projected demand 
in  as a result of a large and unforecasted decline in sales  we determined that a significant portion of our inventory was excess to projected demand and recorded an inventory provision of million 
while we endeavor to accurately predict demand and stock commensurate inventory levels  we may record unanticipated material inventory write downs in the future 
taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax liabilities and the determination of deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition methods 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that management estimates is more likely than not to be realized 
if in the future we determine that we are not likely to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty in the application of complex tax laws 
we are currently under examination by various taxing authorities 
we record tax reserves for additional taxes that we estimate we may be required to pay as a result of such examinations 
if the payment ultimately proves to be unnecessary  
index to financial statements the reversal of these tax reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period we determine such reserves are no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result 
results of operations our fiscal year ends on the friday nearest december st 
our most recent fiscal year ended on january  for presentation purposes  all financial data refers to our fiscal year end as december st 
the following table sets forth certain items in the consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of net sales for   and years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses restructuring and other special charges income loss from operations interest and other income  net provision for income taxes net income loss we classify our products into three categories new  mainstream  and mature and other products 
during  we updated our product categories  and all prior year data have been adjusted to reflect the following compositions new products include stratix  stratix gx  cyclone  max a and hardcopy devices  mainstream products include apex k  apex kc  apex ke  apex ii  flex ke  acex k  excalibur  mercury  max a  and max b devices  and mature and other products include flex  flex  flex k  flex ka  max  max s  max  classic  configuration and other devices  software and other tools  and ip cores 
sales sales were million in  million in  and million in sales increased in from and declined in from during our sales grew primarily due to higher unit sales of all product categories  with the largest unit increases in new and mainstream products  offset by routine declines in average selling prices primarily in our mainstream and mature and other products 
fpga sales accounted for of total sales and grew in driven predominantly by increased sales of our stratix  apex ke  acex k  and cyclone families 
cpld sales accounted for of total sales and decreased in  driven primarily by decreases in sales of older families  partially offset by increases in the max a and max b families 
the decline in sales in compared to was the result of a general economic downturn and softening demand for products manufactured by our customers 
although our quarterly sequential sales growth resumed in  it was not sufficient to offset the rapid sales decline 
as a result  sales in total decreased compared to the decrease was also due to lower unit sales of our mature and mainstream products as well as lower average unit selling prices in all product categories 

index to financial statements sales by product category sales by product category  as a percentage of total sales  as well as yearly growth or decline  were as follows 
all prior year data has been adjusted to conform to the new classification in years ended december  vs 
change vs 
change new mainstream mature and other total sales our new products have been developed and introduced to the marketplace over the last several years and have additional features and higher densities than their predecessors 
new products increased predominantly due to customer prototyping and development activities using our stratix  cyclone  and max a families 
the year was the first full year of sales for stratix  and cyclone first began generating sales in the first quarter of the new product growth of in was due to our max a and stratix families  with stratix first generating sales in the second quarter of we expect that sales of our new products will continue to increase as customer adoption of our new products continues to be strong  and customers ramp their programs into volume production 
sales by market segment the following market segment data is derived from data that is provided to us by our distributors and end customers 
with a broad base of customers  who in some cases manufacture end products spanning multiple market segments  the assignment of revenue to a market segment requires the use of estimates  judgment  and extrapolation 
as such  actual results may differ from those reported 
effective january   we adopted a new methodology for revenue classification by market segment 
comparable data for is not available 
sales by market segment  as a percentage of total sales  as well as yearly growth or decline  were as follows years ended december  vs 
change communications industrial consumer computer and storage total sales during  our consumer and industrial market segments provided strong growth over the prior year as a result of increased usage of plds by customers in these market segments 
communications grew due to improving market conditions in the telecom subsegment and increased market share in the wireless subsegment across multiple customers 
computer and storage declined in due to weakness in the storage subsegment partially offset by an increase in the servers subsegment 
while we expect that communications will remain our largest market segment  we anticipate that the industrial and consumer market segments will continue to significantly contribute to our future growth 
no single end customer provided more than of our sales for the years ended december    and 
index to financial statements sales by geography the following table is based on the geographic location of the distributor or oem who purchased our products which may be different from the geographic locations of our end customers 
years ended december  vs 
change vs 
change north america europe japan asia pacific total international total sales sales in asia pacific and japan increased significantly in compared to the prior year due primarily to strong demand from a broad base of customers for our new products 
the percentage of total sales represented by asia pacific increased as a result of the transfer of business from north america and from europe  as well as an increase in sales to local customers 
we expect that sales will continue to transfer to asia pacific from other geographies 
north america sales declined in from  while sales in europe declined  and japan declined 
the declines in sales were primarily due to a general economic downturn and softening end market demand especially in the communications and computer and storage sectors 
gross margin years ended december  dollars in millions gross margin percentage included in reported gross margin percentage above inventory write down percentage of sales gross margin benefit from sale of inventory written down in percentage of sales gross margin increased percentage points in from the increase was primarily due to yield enhancements and overall declines in unit costs and partially due to higher gross margin benefit resulting from the sale of inventory previously written down in gross margin increased percentage points in from primarily as a result of the inventory write down in as of december   the book value of the inventory written down in was essentially zero while the cost basis was million 
this cost basis was comprised of million of raw materials and work in process inventory and million of finished goods inventory 
research and development expenses years ended december  vs 
change vs 
change dollars in millions research and development percentage of sales 
index to financial statements research and development expenses include expenditures for labor  masks  prototype wafers  and the amortization of deferred stock based compensation for employees engaged in research and development activities 
these expenditures were for the design of new pld families  and the development of process technologies  new packages  and software to support new products and design environments 
research and development expenses decreased slightly in compared to  primarily due to lower spending on prototype wafers  which was partially offset by increased spending on labor and benefit costs 
research and development expenses increased in primarily due to higher spending on prototype wafers 
historically  the level of research and development expenses has fluctuated in part due to the timing of the purchase of masks and prototype wafers used in the development of new products 
we will continue to make significant investments in the development of new products and focus our efforts on the development of new programmable products that utilize advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes  as well as related development software 
we are currently investing in the development of our stratix ii  max ii  cyclone ii  and hardcopy families  our quartus ii software  our library of ip cores  and other future products 
selling  general  and administrative expenses years ended december  vs 
change vs 
change dollars in millions selling  general  and administrative percentage of sales selling  general  and administrative expenses primarily include salary expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  commissions and incentives  depreciation  legal  advertising  facilities  and travel expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million in compared to the increase was primarily due to higher spending for labor and benefits costs  as well as higher spending for commissions and incentives and consulting and professional services 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease was primarily due to spending control measures including the restructuring program implemented in  lower expenses for labor  advertising  recruiting  and travel  as well as reduced litigation expenses stemming from the settlement of our litigation with xilinx  inc  and lattice semiconductor corporation 
restructuring and other special charges during  we recorded restructuring and other special charges of million 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these charges  along with the inventory write down of million in  led to the loss from operations for that year 
interest and other income  net years ended december  vs 
change vs 
change dollars in millions interest and other income  net percentage of sales interest and other income consists mainly of interest income generated from investments in high quality fixed income securities 
the year over year declines in both and were primarily due to declines in market interest rates as well as a recognized loss of million on the sale of certain securities in the second quarter of 
index to financial statements provision for income taxes our effective tax rates were for  for  and for the increase in the effective tax rate in over primarily resulted from the decreased benefit of tax exempt income and research and development tax credits  which was partially offset by a favorable change in the geographic mix of income 
our effective tax rate was for primarily due to inventory and restructuring and other special charges taken in financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources we ended with over billion of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments available to finance our operating activities and future growth 
we currently use cash generated from operations to support our operating activities  capital expenditures  and acquisitions and investments 
we also use our available cash for repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program 
as of december   there were no outstanding loans due from us 
in  we spent million to repurchase our common stock  compared to million in  and million in we also spent million to purchase property and equipment in  compared to million in  and million in we expect that capital expenditures will increase in and we will continue to use a portion of our available capital to repurchase shares 
year cash and cash equivalents increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  our positive cash flow from operating activities was primarily attributable to net income  depreciation and amortization  amortization of deferred stock based compensation  increases in deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors of million  million of income taxes payable  and million of tax benefit from stock plans 
these items were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million 
cash used for investing activities of million primarily consisted of purchases of available for sale investments of million and capital equipment of million 
these items were partially offset by proceeds from the maturity and sale of available for sale investments of million and held to maturity investments of million 
cash used for financing activities of million resulted from the million repurchase of our common stock  which was partially offset by net proceeds of million from the issuance of our common stock to employees through various option plans and our employee stock purchase plan 
year we ended with million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  our positive cash flow from operations was primarily due to net income  depreciation and amortization  amortization of deferred stock based compensation  decreases in other current assets of million resulting primarily from the receipt of a tax refund  million of inventories  and million of deferred income taxes 
these items were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable 
during  cash used for investing activities of million primarily consisted of purchases of available for sale investments of million and capital equipment of million 
these items were partially offset by proceeds from the maturity and sale of available for sale investments of million 
cash used for financing activities of million resulted from the million repurchase of our common stock  which was partially offset by net proceeds of million from the issuance of our common stock to employees through various option plans and our employee stock purchase plan 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our available sources of funds including cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash we expect to generate from operations will be adequate to finance our operations for at least the next year 

index to financial statements contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods payment due by year contractual obligations total less than year years years after years dollars in millions operating lease obligations inventory and related purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we lease facilities under non cancelable lease agreements expiring at various times through rental expense amounted to million in we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and test services 
due to lengthy subcontractor lead times  we must order these materials and services from these subcontractors well in advance  and we are obligated to pay for the materials and services once they are completed 
we expect to receive and pay for these materials and services within the next four to six months 
impact of currency translation and inflation we purchase the majority of our materials and services in us dollars and sell our products to oems and distributors in us dollars 
as of december   we had no open forward contracts  however  we may enter into contracts from time to time to hedge foreign exchange exposure 
we have  in the past  entered into forward contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations associated with contractual commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
common stock repurchases in january  our board of directors approved an increase in the shares authorized for repurchase under a stock repurchase plan from million shares to million shares 
share repurchase activities for   and  were as follows in millions  except per share amounts shares repurchased cost of shares repurchased average price per share since the inception of our repurchase program in through december   we have repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of billion 
all shares were retired upon acquisition 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 

index to financial statements risk factors the following risk factors  among others  could in the future affect our actual results of operations and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by us 
before you decide to buy  hold  or sell our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained elsewhere in this report 
the following risk factors are not the only risk factors facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition  and results of operation could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our financial results depend on our ability to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the programmable logic industry is intensely competitive 
our ability to compete successfully in the industry will depend on our ability to develop  manufacture  and sell complex semiconductor components and development tools that offer customers greater value than solutions offered by competing vendors such as xilinx and lattice 
because we develop plds for applications that are presently served by vendors of asics  assps  microcontrollers  and digital signal processors  we also indirectly compete against vendors of these products 
many of these vendors  including international business machines corporation  lsi logic corporation  and texas instruments inc  have substantially greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do and have well established market positions and solutions that have been proven technically feasible and economically competitive over several decades 
we may not be able to displace these vendors in the targeted applications and densities 
further  other programmable logic vendors are targeting these applications and may be successful in securing market share from us 
moreover  some of our customers have historically used standard cell technologies to achieve greater integration in their systems  this may not only impede our efforts to penetrate the markets for asics  assps  microcontrollers  and digital signal processors  but may also displace our products in the applications that we presently serve 
our future success depends on our ability to define  develop  and sell new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic market characterized by rapid technological change 
our current product development efforts focus on developing new plds  related development software and hardware  and advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes 
our development efforts may not result in the timely introduction of competitive new products  or enhancements to existing products  and or market acceptance of new and enhanced products 
we depend entirely on independent subcontractors to supply us with finished silicon wafers 
we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers 
we purchase nearly all of our silicon wafers from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  with most of its manufacturing facilities located in taiwan  and the remaining portion from sharp corporation  located in japan 
silicon wafer production facilities have at any given time a fixed capacity  the allocation of which is determined solely by our vendors and over which we have no direct control 
we have no formalized long term supply or allocation commitments from our foundry suppliers 
if market demand for silicon wafers suddenly exceeds market supply  our supply of silicon wafers could quickly become limited 
a shortage in foundry manufacturing capacity could hinder our ability to meet demand for our products 
moreover  silicon wafers constitute more than half of our product cost 
if we are unable to procure wafers at favorable prices  our gross margins will be adversely affected 
to ensure the continued supply of wafers  we may establish other sources of wafer supply for our products as such arrangements become economically advantageous or technically necessary 
however  there are only a few foundry vendors that have the capabilities to manufacture our products 
if we engage alternative sources of supply with foundry 
index to financial statements vendors that have the capabilities to manufacture our products  we may encounter start up difficulties and incur additional costs 
also  shipments could be delayed significantly while such sources are qualified for volume production 
in addition to sufficient foundry manufacturing capacity and wafer prices  we depend on good production yields good die per wafer  and timely delivery of silicon wafers to meet our customers demand for products and to maintain profit margins 
wafer production yields depend on a wide variety of factors  including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
as is common in the semiconductor industry  we have experienced  and may experience from time to time  problems with achieving acceptable production yields and timely delivery from our foundry vendors 
difficulties in production yields can often occur when we begin production of new products  when we transition to new processes  or when our principal wafer supplier  tsmc  moves production of a product from one manufacturing plant to another  or manufactures the same product at multiple factories 
further  production throughput times vary considerably among the various factories used by our wafer suppliers  and we may experience delays from time to time in processing some of our products 
these difficulties and delays can potentially result in significantly higher costs and lower product availability 
we have in the past experienced higher than anticipated costs and supply shortages 
for example  from the fourth quarter of through the first half of  process control issues associated with volume ramp up at a wafer supplier resulted in lower than expected die yields on our flex ka and flex ke products  thereby leading to reduced product availability in these families 
as a result  we were unable to support distributor stocking at desired levels and in some cases could not meet end customer demand 
we expect that  to maintain or enhance our competitive position  we will continue to introduce new products using  and convert established products to  new and more advanced process technologies 
for example  our stratix  stratix gx and cyclone families are manufactured on a nanometer  all layer copper interconnect process 
the company s next generation product families  the stratix ii and cyclone ii families  will be manufactured on a nanometer all layer copper interconnect process for which altera has no production history 
we will also continue to transition our fabrication process arrangements to larger wafer sizes and smaller circuit geometries 
the stratix and cyclone families are currently migrating from mm to mm wafer sizes  and the next generation product families will be exclusively manufactured on mm wafers 
manufacturing mm wafers is relatively new to the industry and altera has a limited production history 
such transitions entail inherent technological risks and start up difficulties that can adversely affect r d spending  yields  product costs  and timeliness of delivery 
to enhance our product designs and cost structure  we depend on all of our subcontractors  and especially our principal foundry partner  tsmc  to improve process technologies in a timely manner 
we depend on independent subcontractors  located in asia  to assemble and test our semiconductor products 
independent subcontractors  located in asia  assemble and test our semiconductor products 
because we rely on independent subcontractors to perform these services  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules or quality levels 
for example  in the second quarter of  difficulties with a subcontractor s manufacturing process limited the availability of packaging materials piece parts used in certain of our proprietary fineline bga  or ball grid array  packages  thereby causing limited production 
this in turn limited shipments of our flex ke product family 
our future success also depends on the financial viability of our independent subcontractors 
for example  in  the reduction in overall demand for semiconductor products financially stressed certain of our subcontractors and weakened their capital structures 
if the capital structures of our independent subcontractors weaken  we may experience product shortages  quality assurance problems  increased manufacturing costs  and or supply chain disruption 
conditions outside the control of our independent subcontractors may impact their business operations 
the economic  market  social  and political situations in countries where certain independent subcontractors are located are unpredictable  can be volatile  and can have a significant impact on our business because we may not be able to obtain product in a timely manner 
market and political conditions  including currency fluctuation  terrorism  political strife  war  labor disruption  and other factors  including natural or man made disasters  adverse changes in tax laws  
index to financial statements tariff  import or export quotas  power and water shortages  or interruption in air transportation  in areas where our independent subcontractors are located also could have a severe negative impact on our operating capabilities 
for example  in september  a major earthquake struck taiwan  resulting in widespread physical damage and loss of life 
the earthquake halted wafer fabrication production at our primary vendor  tsmc  for several days and then only limited production began 
nearly two weeks passed before full production resumed  and a portion of the inventory in the production process was scrapped as a result of damage incurred during the earthquake 
our independent subcontractors may experience similar or more severe problems in the future as a result of similar events 
our intellectual property rights may not provide meaningful protection from our competitors 
we rely significantly on patents to protect our intellectual property rights 
as of december   more than patents relating to various aspects of our products and technology had been issued to us in the united states 
we also have a number of other patents issued in other countries as well as a number of patent applications pending 
our patents and patent applications may not provide meaningful protection from our competitors 
our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents or develop new patentable technologies that displace our existing products 
further  we may not be able to timely develop or patent new technologies  and those patents granted to us may not be valuable in all markets or may not enable us to develop new products that achieve market acceptance 
also  from time to time in the normal course of business  we receive and make inquiries with respect to possible patent infringements 
as a result of inquiries received from third parties  it may be necessary or desirable for us to obtain licenses relating to one or more of our current or future products 
we may not be able to obtain such licenses on reasonable terms 
in addition to patent protection  we rely on trademark  trade secret  copyright  and mask work laws to protect our unpatented proprietary information or technologies 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure  parties  including our former employees or consultants  may attempt to disclose  obtain  or use our proprietary information or technologies without our authorization 
other companies may also develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or technologies or infringe on our trademarks and service marks  potentially diminishing the value of our brand 
the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information and technologies  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if other companies obtain our proprietary information or technologies or develop substantially equivalent information or technologies  they may develop products that compete against our products 
we may face significant costs arising from intellectual property litigation 
intellectual property claims  regardless of their merit  can result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel 
legal proceedings also tend to be unpredictable and may be affected by events outside of our control 
further  we may not succeed in defending or enforcing our intellectual property rights 
if we are not successful in defending or enforcing our intellectual property rights  or in defending against third party intellectual property infringement claims  third parties may obtain significant monetary damages or an injunction against the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product families 
we cannot assure you that intellectual property litigation will not have an adverse effect on our financial position  or results of operations or cash flows 
we have been a party to lawsuits and may in the future become a party to lawsuits involving various types of claims  including  but not limited to  unfair competition and intellectual property matters 
in july  we entered into a settlement agreement with xilinx under which we settled all pending litigation with xilinx 
as part of the settlement agreement  we entered into a royalty free patent cross license agreement with xilinx  including a prohibition against further patent litigation between the two companies through july in connection with the settlement agreement  we paid xilinx a one time payment of million 
prior to the settlement with xilinx  we devoted substantial financial resources over an eight year period to the xilinx litigation 
similarly  in july  we entered into a settlement agreement with lattice under which we settled all pending patent litigation 
as part of the settlement agreement with lattice  we entered into a royalty free patent cross license agreement with lattice  including a multi year prohibition against further patent litigation between the two companies 
no payments were made by altera or lattice as part of the settlement 
we cannot assure you that these cross license agreements will be renewed after expiration  or the litigation prohibition periods extended  and whether any renewal or extension would be upon reasonable terms 

index to financial statements we may incur warranty related liabilities 
we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship and non conformance to our specifications for varying lengths of time 
if there is a material increase in customer claims compared with our historical experience  or if costs of servicing warranty claims are greater than expected  we may record a charge against future cost of sales and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
we depend on distributors to generate sales and fulfill our customer orders 
worldwide sales through distributors accounted for more than percent of our total sales during we rely on several distributors to assist us in creating customer demand  providing technical support and other value added services to our customers  filling customer orders  and stocking our products 
our contracts with our distributors may be terminated by either party in a relatively short period of time 
our distributors are located all over the world and are of various sizes and financial conditions 
the economic downturn during placed financial strain on our distributors 
lower sales  lower earnings  debt downgrades  the inability to access capital markets  and higher interest rates could potentially impact our distributors operations 
we are highly dependent on arrow electronics  inc  in many locations across the world  particularly in north america 
during  arrow on a worldwide basis accounted for approximately of sales  and the next largest distributor accounted for approximately of sales 
as of december   three distributors  each of which accounted for more than of total accounts receivable  accounted for   and of total accounts receivable 
our distributors have sole authority to accept returns from end customers in the ordinary course of business 
returns from end customers to our distributors are negative sales transactions and reduce our reported sales 
consequently  large returns could have a material adverse impact on our sales 
the length of our design in and sales cycle could impact our future sales 
our sales depend on our products being designed into our end customers products and those products achieving volume production 
our products are very complex in nature  and the time from design in to volume production ranges from months to years 
from initial product design in to volume production  many factors could impact the timing and or amount of sales actually realized from the design in 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in the competitive position of our technology  the competitiveness of our customers products in the markets they serve  our customers financial stability  and our ability to ship products according to our customers schedule 
we depend on international sales for a majority of our total sales 
during each of the last two years  international sales were a majority of our total sales 
during  international sales constituted approximately of our total sales 
risks related to our foreign operations include unfavorable economic  market  political  and social conditions in a specific country or region  fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates  adverse changes in tax laws  increased freight costs  interruptions in air transportation  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  generally longer receivable collection periods  and natural or man made disasters in a specific country or region where we sell our products 
our business is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the importation or exportation of semiconductor products 
quotas  duties  tariffs  taxes  or other charges  restrictions  or trade barriers may be imposed by the united states or other countries upon the importation or exportation of our products in the future 
our business is subject to tax risks associated with being a multinational corporation 
as a multinational corporation  we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions 
the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions 
the application of tax law is subject to legal and factual 
index to financial statements interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty and tax laws themselves are subject to change 
consequently  taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could result in a significant charge to earnings relating to prior periods and or an increase in our effective income tax rate 
our gross margins are subject to fluctuations due to many factors 
our gross margins may fluctuate depending on many factors  including  but not limited to  our product mix  market acceptance of our new products  competitive pricing dynamics  geographic and or market segment pricing strategies  and various manufacturing cost variables  including product yields  wafer prices and absorption of manufacturing overhead 
our financial results are affected by general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  which means that semiconductor companies such as altera experience significant fluctuations in sales and profitability 
during  the semiconductor industry was significantly impacted by the economic downturn and contraction in the computing and communication equipment markets and by the ensuing inventory correction in the supply chain for those industries 
this down cycle  like many of the preceding down cycles  resulted in significant reductions in unit demand  excess customer inventories  price erosion  and excess production capacity 
we experienced five consecutive declines in quarterly sales beginning in the fourth quarter of and ending in the fourth quarter of the protracted deceleration resulted in a peak to trough decline in quarterly sales of nearly 
we anticipate that the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry will continue and that our sales will fluctuate accordingly 
in addition to reductions in sales  our profitability decreases during downturns as we are unable to reduce our expenses at the same rate as our sales decline 
for example  at the height of the previous upcycle  in the third quarter of  our operating expenses were less than of sales compared to almost in the first quarter of similarly  our gross margins tend to deteriorate and fluctuate during down cycles 
for example  in the third quarter of  our reported gross margin was over of sales compared to of sales in the first quarter of furthermore  the industry contraction during was prolonged and severe and resulted in an inventory provision of million in relating primarily to the write off of inventories in excess to projected demand 
additionally  as a result of reduced demand and in an effort to reduce our ongoing expense levels  we incurred restructuring charges and write downs totaling million in in the year ended december   our net income was million on sales of billion whereas for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million on sales of million 
we expect that our future sales and profitability will continue to be volatile 
in an effort to reduce the possibility of future provision for excess inventory  we reduced our inventory carrying targets in reductions in targeted inventory carrying levels may result in poorer delivery performance relative to our customers desired lead times  which over time may erode our competitive position and result in a loss of market share 
despite our intent to operate with lower inventory levels  we are likely to experience inventory write downs in the future  especially if our inventory becomes out of mix with  or excess to  customer demand 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products  general economic  market  political  and social conditions in the countries where we sell our products  demand for our products and the products of our customers  the pricing of our products and the products of our competitors  the gain or loss of a key customer  
index to financial statements the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions  our inventory levels and product obsolescence  the scheduling  rescheduling  and cancellation of large orders by our customers  the availability of adequate supply commitments from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors  our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at the foundries of tsmc or sharp  changes in manufacturing yields  changes in distribution partners or their financial stability  adverse movements in exchange rates  interest rates  or tax rates  or litigation expenses  including those litigation expenses incurred in connection with the defense or enforcement of our intellectual property rights 
our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical and management personnel 
our future success depends  in large part  upon the continued service of our key management  technical  sales  and support employees  and on our ability to continue to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
the competition for such employees is intense and the loss of key employees could prevent our sales and or profits from increasing or could cause our sales and or profits to decline 
our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes and other catastrophic events 
our corporate headquarters is located near major earthquake faults 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake  may cause significant disruption to our business 
in addition  our computer systems are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering 
further  our business is subject to the effects of war and acts of terrorism 
any catastrophic event  such as an earthquake or other natural disasters  the failure of our computer systems  or war or acts of terrorism  could significantly impair our ability to maintain our records  pay our suppliers  or manufacture or ship our products 
the occurrence of any of these events could also affect our distributors and subcontractors and produce similar disruptive effects upon their business 
we carry only limited insurance coverages 
our insurance policies may not be adequate to fully offset the losses resulting from covered incidents 
additionally  we do not have coverage for certain losses 
our stock price is subject to significant volatility 
in recent years  the stock market has experienced extreme price volatility and the price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
the overall stock market  the prices of semiconductor stocks in general  and the price of our stock is likely to continue to fluctuate greatly 
we believe that factors such as quarter to quarter variances in financial results  announcements of new products  new orders  and order rate variations by us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the stock prices for many technology companies experience large fluctuations  which are often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic conditions such as a recessionary period or high interest rates  may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

index to financial statements item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of billion as of december  and million as of december  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will vary in value as market interest rates fluctuate 
if market interest rates were to increase or decline immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the increase or decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
although we purchase the majority of our materials and services in us dollars and sell our products to oems and distributors in us dollars  we do have international operations and are  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility has been insignificant 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates at december   our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
however  we cannot assure you that there will not be a material impact in the future
