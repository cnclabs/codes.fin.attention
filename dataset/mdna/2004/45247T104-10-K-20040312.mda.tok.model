item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview imagistics international inc imagistics or the company is a large direct sales  service and marketing organization offering document imaging and management solutions  including copiers  multifunctional products and facsimile machines in the united states and the united kingdom 
our primary customers include large corporate customers known as national accounts  government entities and mid size and regional businesses known as commercial accounts 
multifunctional products  often referred to as mfps  offer the multiple functionality of printing  copying  scanning and faxing in a single unit 
in addition  we offer a range of document imaging options including digital  analog  color and or networked products and systems 
our strategic vision is to become the leading independent direct provider of enterprise office imaging and document solutions by providing world class products and services with unparalleled customer support and satisfaction with a focus on multiple location customers  thus building value for our shareholders  customers and employees 
our strategic initiatives include o maintaining and further strengthening major account relationships  o expanding our product offerings through our sourcing and distribution relationships  o increasing outreach of our direct sales and service force to the copier mfp market  o focusing on customer needs and o pursuing opportunistic expansion and investments 
the principal evolution in our industry and business has been the transition to networked digital copiers mfps  away from single function standalone facsimile machines and analog copiers 
this transition has resulted in decreased demand for and usage of single function facsimile equipment in the marketplace 
we have responded to this market development by focusing our efforts on the growth opportunities existing in our digital copier and mfp product lines 
although our total revenue has declined only slightly  the decrease in facsimile usage and our focus on the digital copier and mfp growth potential has resulted in a decrease in facsimile product line revenues  which has been offset by an increase in our copier mfp product line revenues 
imagistics spin off from pitney bowes on december   the board of directors of pitney bowes inc pitney bowes approved the spin off of the us and us operations of its office systems business to its common stockholders as an independent  publicly traded company 
on december   imagistics was spun off from pitney bowes pursuant to a contribution by pitney bowes of substantially all of pitney bowes us and uk office systems businesses to us and a distribution of our common stock to common stockholders of pitney bowes based on a distribution ratio of share of our common stock for every shares of pitney bowes common stock held at the close of business on november  the distribution or spin off 
pitney bowes no longer has a financial investment in our business 
we entered into a transition services agreement with pitney bowes providing for certain essential services to us for a limited period following the distribution 
these services were provided at cost and included information technology  computing  telecommunications  accounting  field service of equipment and dispatch call center services 
we and pitney bowes had agreed to an extension until december   of the transition services agreement as it related to information technology and related services 
services provided under this extension were at negotiated market rates 
except for field service of equipment  all of the services provided by pitney bowes under these agreements have ceased effective december   in accordance with the terms of the agreements 
effective july   we and pitney bowes entered into a separate one year service agreement on an arms length basis relating to field service of equipment in certain remote geographic locations not covered by our direct service organization 
services provided under this agreement are at negotiated market rates 
for  we paid pitney bowes million in connection with the transition services agreement  field service of equipment and other administrative expenses 
for and for the period from december  through december   we paid pitney bowes million and million  respectively  in connection with these agreements and certain shared corporate and administrative services 
we also entered into certain other agreements covering intellectual property  commercial relationships  leases and licensing arrangements and tax separation matters 
the pricing terms of the products and services covered by the other commercial agreements reflect negotiated prices 
the consolidated financial statements for the periods prior to the distribution include allocations of certain pitney bowes corporate expenses 
corporate expense allocations were charged based generally on the ratio of our costs and expenses to pitney bowes costs and expenses 
pitney bowes allocated expenses primarily included administrative expenses such as accounting services  real estate costs  customer service support in remote geographic areas and information technology and amounted to million for the period from january  through the distribution 
we believe the costs of these services charged to us were a reasonable representation of the services provided or benefits received by us 
in addition  interest expense was charged to us from pitney bowes based upon the proportion of our net assets to pitney bowes net assets 
we believe that this was a reasonable method of allocation 
as part of pitney bowes  we also benefited from various economies of scale  including shared global administrative functions and shared facilities 
our costs and expenses have and may continue to increase as a result of the loss of these economies of scale and we have incurred greater expenses associated with our status as a stand alone public company 
basis of financial statement presentation the consolidated financial statements include certain historical assets  liabilities and related operations of the united states and united kingdom office systems businesses  which were contributed to us from pitney bowes prior to the distribution 
the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and depict our results as a stand alone company 
the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the distribution were derived from the financial statements and accounting records of pitney bowes using the historical results of operations and historical basis of assets and liabilities of the united states and united kingdom office systems businesses 
prior to the formation of imagistics  the office systems business was operated as a division of pitney bowes  and  as such  pitney bowes investment in imagistics is shown in lieu of stockholders equity in the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the distribution 
we began accumulating retained earnings on the date of the distribution 
we believe the assumptions underlying the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  are reasonable 
however  the consolidated financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the future or what our financial position  results of operations and cash flows as of and for the year ended december  would have been for periods prior to the distribution had we operated as a stand alone entity during those periods 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates include assessing the allocation of costs from pitney bowes  usage of equipment for rental assets billed in arrears  sales returns  usage adjustments and other allowances for equipment sales  equipment rentals and service contract billings  the collectibility of accounts receivable  the use and recoverability of inventory  the useful lives of tangible assets  the realization of deferred taxes and an evaluation of the potential impairment  if any  of goodwill and other long lived assets  among others 
the markets for our products are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological development and pricing pressures  all of which could affect the future realizability of our assets 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have identified certain accounting policies that are critical to the understanding of our results of operations due to the judgment management must make in their application 
these significant accounting policies are outlined below 
revenue recognition revenue on equipment and supplies sales is recognized when contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for copier mfp equipment  the satisfaction of contractual obligations and the passing of title and risk of loss to the customer occur upon the installation of the equipment at the customer location 
for facsimile equipment and facsimile supplies  the satisfaction of contractual obligations and the passing of title and risk of loss to the customer occur upon the delivery of the facsimile equipment and the facsimile supplies to the customer location 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and other allowances based upon historical experience 
rental contracts  which often include supplies  are generally for an initial term of three years with automatic renewals unless we receive prior notice of cancellation 
under the terms of rental contracts  we bill our customers a flat periodic charge and or a usage based fee 
revenues related to these contracts are recognized each month as earned  either using the straight line method or based upon usage  as applicable 
we record a provision for estimated usage adjustments on rental contracts based upon historical experience 
support services contracts  which typically include supplies  are generally for an initial term of one year with automatic renewals unless we receive prior notice of cancellation 
under the terms of support services contracts  we bill our customers either a flat periodic charge or a usage based fee 
revenues related to these contracts are recognized each month as earned  either using the straight line method or based upon usage  as applicable 
we record a provision for estimated usage adjustments on service contracts based upon historical experience 
certain rental and support services contracts provide for invoicing in advance  generally quarterly 
revenue on contracts billed in advance is deferred and recognized as earned revenue over the billed period 
certain rental and support services contracts provide for invoicing in arrears  generally quarterly 
revenue on contracts billed in arrears is accrued based upon a flat periodic charge and or estimated usage and recognized in the period in which it is earned 
we enter into arrangements that include multiple deliverables  which typically consist of the sale of equipment with a support services contract 
we account for each element within an arrangement with multiple deliverables as separate units of accounting 
revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the residual method  which requires the allocation of the revenue based on the fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value of support services is primarily determined by reference to renewal pricing of support services contracts when sold on a stand alone basis 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value by recording allowances for those accounts receivable amounts that we believe are uncollectible 
our estimate of losses is based on prior collection experience including evaluating the credit worthiness of each of our customers  analyzing historical bad debt write offs and reviewing the aging of the receivables 
our allowance for doubtful accounts includes amounts for specific accounts that we believe are uncollectible  as well as amounts that have been computed by applying certain percentages based on historic loss trends  to certain accounts receivable aging categories 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
provisions  when required  are made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values 
inventory provisions are calculated using management s best estimates of inventory value based on the age of the inventory  quantities on hand compared with historical and projected usage and current and anticipated demands 
depreciation of rental equipment rental equipment is comprised of equipment on rent to customers and is depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the equipment 
copier equipment is depreciated over three years and facsimile equipment placed in service before october  is depreciated over five years 
facsimile equipment placed in service on or after october  is depreciated over three years 
capitalized computer software costs we capitalize certain costs of internally developed software 
capitalized internal costs include purchased materials and services and payroll and payroll related costs 
costs for general administration  overhead  maintenance and training  as well as the cost of software that does not add functionality to the existing system  are expensed as incurred 
the cost of internally developed software is amortized on a straight line basis over appropriate periods  principally three to seven years 
the unamortized balance of internally developed software is included in fixed assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
requires the use of a nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a nonamortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles are not amortized into results of operations  but instead are reviewed periodically for impairment with any resulting impairment charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and intangibles is more than their fair value 
sfas no 
prescribes a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of goodwill  the second step of the impairment test is required and the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of the assets and liabilities in the same manner performed in a purchase price allocation 
the fair value of the goodwill is then compared to its carrying amount to determine if there is goodwill impairment 
we completed our review of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
effective october  and have determined that our recorded goodwill is not impaired 
deferred taxes on income income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the periods the temporary differences are expected to be settled 
a valuation allowance is established  as needed  to reduce net deferred tax assets to realizable value 
a valuation allowance has not been established for our deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not  they will be realized 
financial instruments we recognize all derivative financial instruments as assets and liabilities and measure them at fair value 
all derivative financial instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and  accordingly  the effective portions of changes in fair value of the derivative were recorded in other comprehensive income and were recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affected earnings 
historically  we used interest rate swap agreements to manage and reduce risk related to interest payments on our debt instruments 
during the third quarter of  we revised our cash flow estimates and disposed of our two interest rate swap agreements and as a result  reclassified the cumulative change in the fair market value of the interest rate swap agreements from other comprehensive income into interest expense

prior to the distribution  sales to pitney bowes of canada were primarily accounted for as intercompany transfers 
we expect to maintain a reseller arrangement with pitney bowes of canada  however  we are unable to predict the future level of sales to pitney bowes of canada 
we believe it is useful to analyze sales excluding sales to pitney bowes of canada in order to better evaluate the effectiveness of our direct sales and marketing initiatives and our pricing policies

although the initial term of our rental contracts are generally three years  they typically provide a continuing stream of revenue resulting from automatic renewal options or new rental contracts for replacement equipment 
historically  our recurring revenue has consistently been in the range of approximately of total revenue 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that our recurring revenue will continue at these rates 
we believe this information is useful because it indicates our ability to generate a consistent revenue base

our effective tax rate was in compared with in prior to the distribution  our income was included in the pitney bowes consolidated income tax returns and our tax expense was calculated as if imagistics and pitney bowes filed separate income tax returns 
expansion of sales and service capabilities during  we acquired substantially all of the assets and business of one independent dealer of copier and multifunctional equipment and related support services and during  we acquired substantially all of the assets and business of one independent dealer of copier and multifunctional equipment and related support services  to expand our geographic sales and service capabilities 
these acquisitions  individually or in the aggregate  were not significant to our financial position or results of operations 
these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price  including direct costs of the acquisitions  was allocated to acquired assets and assumed liabilities 
the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill 
the operating results of these acquisitions are included in our financial statements from the dates of the respective acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources on november  we entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders the credit agreement that provided for secured borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed million  comprised of a million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility and a million term loan the term loan 
the term of the revolving credit facility is five years and the term of the term loan is six years 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets plus of the stock of our subsidiary as security for our obligations under the credit agreement 
available borrowings and letter of credit issuance under the revolving credit facility are determined by a borrowing base consisting of a percentage of our eligible accounts receivable  inventory  rental assets and accrued and advance billings  less outstanding borrowings under the term loan 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and a maximum leverage ratio total debt to ebitda  as well as other covenants  which  among other things  place limits on dividend payments and capital expenditures 
the credit agreement allowed us to originally repurchase up to million of our stock and to make acquisitions up to an aggregate consideration of million 
at december  and  we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants 
originally  amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bore interest at variable rates based  at our option  on either the libor rate plus a margin of from to  depending on our leverage ratio  or the fleet bank base lending rate plus a margin of from to  depending on our leverage ratio 
amounts borrowed under the term loan bore interest at variable rates based  at our option  on either the libor rate plus a margin of or  depending on our leverage ratio  or the fleet bank base lending rate plus a margin of or  depending on our leverage ratio 
a commitment fee of from to on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility was payable quarterly  in arrears  depending on our leverage ratio 
the credit agreement required us to manage our interest rate risk with respect to at least of the aggregate principal amount of the term loan for a period of at least months 
accordingly  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements in the notional amounts of million and million expiring in february to convert the variable interest rate payable on the term loan to a fixed interest rate in order to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows 
these interest rate swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedges 
the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements were major international financial institutions 
under the terms of the swap agreements  we received payments based upon the day libor rate and remitted payments based upon a fixed rate 
the fixed interest rates were and for the million and the million swap agreements  respectively 
our initial borrowings of million under the credit agreement  consisting of million under the term loan and million under the revolving credit facility  were used to repay amounts due to pitney bowes and to pay a dividend to pitney bowes 
at december   pitney bowes credit corporation pbcc provided substantially all of our term loan 
during  pbcc disposed of its commitments under the credit agreement and is no longer a participant in the credit agreement 
on march   the credit agreement was amended to increase the total amount of our stock permitted to be repurchased from million to million 
on july   the credit agreement was amended to increase the total amount of our stock permitted to be repurchased from million to million and to reduce the term loan interest rates to libor plus a margin of from to  depending on our leverage ratio  or to the fleet bank base lending rate plus a margin of from to  depending on our leverage ratio 
on march   the credit agreement was amended to increase the total amount of stock permitted to be repurchased from million to million  to reduce the minimum ebitda covenant to million for the remainder of the term of the credit agreement and to revise the limitation on capital expenditures 
on may   the credit agreement was further amended the fourth amendment to reduce the aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility from million to million  to delete the requirement that we maintain interest rate protection with respect to at least of the aggregate principal amount of the term loan  to reduce and fix the term loan interest rate to libor plus a margin of  from libor plus a margin of from to  depending on our leverage ratio  or to the fleet bank base lending rate plus a margin of  from the fleet bank base lending rate plus a margin of from to  depending on our leverage ratio  to reduce and fix the revolving credit facility interest rate to libor plus a margin of  from libor plus a margin of from to  depending on our leverage ratio  or to the fleet bank base lending rate plus a margin of  from the fleet bank base lending rate plus a margin of from to  depending on our leverage ratio and to fix our commitment fee at on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility from to on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility  depending on our leverage ratio 
during the third quarter of  we revised our cash flow estimates and prepaid million of the amount outstanding under the term loan 
this prepayment was covered by a portion of the million interest rate swap agreement that had been designated as a cash flow hedge 
since it was no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transactions related to the million term loan prepayment would occur  we recognized a loss related to that portion of the swap agreement underlying the amount of the prepayment by reclassifying million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense 
we also unwound million of the million interest rate swap agreement 
during the third quarter of  we revised our cash flow estimates and prepaid million of the amount outstanding under the term loan 
in light of this revision  the deletion of the interest rate protection requirement resulting from the fourth amendment and our consistent historical positive cash flow and near term estimated operating and capital expenditure requirements  we disposed of our two interest rate swap agreements in the notional amounts of million and million 
accordingly  we reclassified million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense because it was no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transactions would occur 
at december   million of borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement  consisting of million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million of borrowings under the term loan  and the borrowing base amounted to approximately million 
as of february   million of borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement  consisting of million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million of borrowings under the term loan and the borrowing base amounted to approximately million 
approximately million of the revolving credit facility was available for borrowing at december  and approximately million of the revolving credit facility was available for borrowing at february  the term loan is payable in consecutive equal quarterly installments of million due march  through december   three consecutive equal quarterly installments of million due march  through september  and a final payment of million due at maturity 
at december   one irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount of million was outstanding as security for our casualty insurance program 
there were no letters of credit outstanding at december  and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to to at december  compared to to at december  due to an increase in accounts receivable and a reduction in advance billings  partially offset by decreases in cash and inventories and an increase in accounts payable 
at december   our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization declined to from at december  due to debt repayments 
in october  we began the implementation of phase ii of our erp system  consisting of order management  order fulfillment  billing  cash collection  service management and sales compensation 
as a result of this implementation  we have experienced  as expected  certain temporary processing inefficiencies  which have resulted in a short term increase in our working capital requirements  particularly accounts receivable  due to the standardization of our billing practices and schedules across all product lines and the initial temporary suspension in invoicing our customers during the conversion to our new erp system 
we believe that the increase in accounts receivable is temporary and that we will collect substantially all of the amounts billed to customers that were temporarily suspended 
however  if collection losses related to these amounts are significantly higher than our historical experience  we would recognize an increase in our provision for bad debt in the near future 
in addition  certain of the temporary processing inefficiencies have resulted in delays in certain product shipments  service responsiveness and potential inaccuracies in calculated sales compensation 
these issues  coupled with certain revisions to our billing practices  could have a negative impact on customer service and satisfaction  which could result in a potential loss of business 
we are now engaged in a period of stabilization and clean up  as is typical of a large erp implementation and we anticipate this transition will be completed during although no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in the time periods expected  other than the temporary increase in working capital requirements  we do not anticipate that these issues will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or future cash flows 
our cash flows from operations  together with borrowings under the credit agreement  are expected to adequately finance our ordinary operating cash requirements and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we expect to fund further expansion and long term growth primarily with cash flows from operations  together with borrowings under the credit agreement and possible future sales of additional equity or debt securities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and provisions for bad debt and inventory obsolescence in the aggregate provided cash of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the provision for bad debt of million in reflected an increase in the rate of delinquencies 
in  the provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory amounted to million 
in and the provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory amounted to million and million  respectively  to recognize the impact of the continuing market shift from analog to digital equipment on the market value of our inventory

the following table depicts our future payments under material contractual obligations as of december  dollars in millions payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt operating leases long term debt payments are related to the credit agreement 
payments under operating leases relate to the lease and sub lease of properties including sales and service offices under long term lease agreements with initial terms extending from two to fifteen years as described in properties located in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
we have no material commitments other than supply agreements with vendors that extend only to equipment supplies and parts ordered under purchase orders  there are no long term purchase requirements 
we do not have any capital leases or off balance sheet arrangements to finance our business 
we will continue to make additional investments in facilities  rental equipment  computer equipment and systems and our distribution network as required to support our operations 
we anticipate investments in rental equipment assets for new and replacement programs in amounts consistent with the recent past 
we estimate that we will spend approximately million during the first half of to continue to enhance our information systems infrastructure and implement our erp system 
in connection with the distribution  we entered into certain agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify pitney bowes with respect to certain matters 
we agreed to assume all liabilities associated with our business  and to indemnify pitney bowes for all claims relating to our business 
these may be claims by or against pitney bowes or us relating to  among other things  contractual rights under vendor  insurance or other contracts  trademark  patent and other intellectual property rights  equipment  service or payment disputes with customers and disputes with employees 
we and pitney bowes entered into a tax separation agreement  which governs our and pitney bowes respective rights  responsibilities and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes for the periods ending on or before the distribution 
in addition  the tax separation agreement generally obligated us not to enter into any transaction that would adversely affect the tax free nature of the distribution for the two year period following the distribution  and obligates us to indemnify pitney bowes and affiliates to the extent that any action we take or fail to take gives rise to a tax liability with respect to the distribution 
in each of these circumstances  payment by us is contingent on pitney bowes making a claim 
as such  it is not possible to predict the maximum potential future payments under these agreements 
as of december   we had not paid any material amounts to pitney bowes pursuant to the above indemnifications 
however  we have paid amounts to defend and resolve claims and litigation related to our business that we assumed as part of the spin off 
we believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters  such loss would not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risk factors that could cause results to vary risk factors relating to our business the document imaging and management industry is undergoing an evolution in product offerings  moving toward the use of networked  digital and color technology in a multifunctional office environment 
our continued success will depend to a great extent on our ability to respond to this rapidly changing environment by developing new options and document imaging solutions for our customers 
the proliferation of e mail  multifunctional products and other technologies in the workplace has led to a reduction in the use of traditional copiers and facsimile machines 
we must be able to continue to obtain products with the appropriate technological advancements in order to remain successful 
we cannot anticipate whether other technological advancements will substantially minimize the need for our products in the future 
many of our rental customers have contract provisions allowing for technology and product upgrades during the term of their contract 
if we have priced these upgrades improperly  this may have an adverse effect on our profitability and future business 
if many of our customers exercise their contractual rights to upgrade to digital equipment  we may experience returns of a large number of analog machines and a subsequent loss of book value on these machines 
the document imaging solutions industry is very competitive  we may be unable to compete favorably  causing us to lose sales to our competitors  many of whom are substantially larger and possess greater financial resources 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to deliver enhanced products  service packages and business processes such as e commerce capabilities  while also offering competitive price levels 
we rely on outside suppliers to manufacture the products that we distribute  many of whom are located in the far east 
in addition  our primary suppliers sell products in competition with us  either directly or through dealer channels 
three manufacturers supply a significant portion of our new copier and multifunctional equipment 
if these manufacturers discontinue their products or are unable to deliver us products in the future or if political changes  economic disruptions or natural disasters occur where their production facilities are located  we will be forced to identify an alternative supplier or suppliers for the affected product 
in addition  although we have worked with our suppliers and freight forwarders to mitigate the potential impacts of an outbreak of infectious disease affecting our supply chain  should our manufacturers become affected by epidemics of infectious diseases  including outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome  we could be forced to identify an alternative supplier or suppliers for the affected product 
although we are confident that we can identify alternate sources of supply  we may not be successful in doing so 
even if we are successful  the replacement product may be more expensive or may lack certain features of the discontinued product and we may experience some delay in obtaining the product 
other events that disrupt the shipment to or receipt of ocean freight at us ports  such as labor unrest  war or terrorist activity could delay  prevent or add substantial cost to our receipt of such products 
any of these events would cause disruption to our customers and could have an adverse effect on our business 
we have a geographic dispersion of business and assets located across the united states comprised of our sales  service and distribution facilities 
changes in international  national or political conditions  including terrorist attacks could impact the sales  service and distribution of our products to our customers and could have an adverse effect on our business 
inflation inflation  although moderate in recent years  continues to affect worldwide economies and the ways companies operate 
although the cost of copier  facsimile and multifunctional equipment has been declining for the last two years  inflation increases labor costs and operating expenses and may  in the future  raise costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment 
industry wide pricing pressures have negatively impacted our profit margins  but we have generally been able to partially offset declining profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements and control of operating expense levels 
foreign currency a portion of our international business is transacted in local currency 
in and  approximately of our total product purchases  based on costs  were denominated in yen and in  approximately of our total product purchases  based on costs  were denominated in yen 
our margins were negatively impacted in and because the strong japanese yen resulted in higher product costs on yen denominated purchases from our japanese vendors 
our margins were positively impacted in as the weak japanese yen resulted in lower product costs on yen denominated purchases from our japanese vendors 
in and  the value of the yen increased approximately and against the us dollar  respectively  while in  the value of the yen declined approximately against the us dollar 
the majority of our remaining product purchases are denominated in us dollars and are produced by japanese suppliers in manufacturing facilities located in china 
currently  the exchange rate of the chinese renminbi and the us dollar is fixed 
if the chinese government were to revalue the chinese renminbi and the nominal value of the renminbi rises  the resultant impact on the exchange rate of the chinese renminbi and the us dollar could have a negative impact on our product cost 
we do not currently utilize any form of derivative financial instruments to manage our exchange rate risk 
we manage our foreign exchange risk by attempting to pass through to our customers any cost increases related to foreign currency exchange 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in passing cost increases through to our customers in the future 
risk factors relating to separating our company from pitney bowes prior to the distribution  our business was operated by pitney bowes as a division of its broader corporate organization  rather than as a separate stand alone entity 
pitney bowes assisted us by providing corporate functions such as legal  tax and information technology functions 
pitney bowes has no further obligation to provide assistance to us 
in october  we began the implementation of phase ii of our erp system  consisting of order management  order fulfillment  billing  cash collection  service management and sales compensation  which replaced the information technology services provided by pitney bowes under the transition services agreement 
as a result of this implementation  we have experienced  as expected  certain temporary processing inefficiencies  which have resulted in a short term increase in our working capital requirements  particularly accounts receivable  due to the standardization of our billing practices and schedules across all product lines and the initial temporary suspension in invoicing our customers during the conversion to our new erp system 
we believe that the increase in accounts receivable is temporary and that we will collect substantially all of the amounts billed to customers that were temporarily suspended 
however  if collection losses related to these amounts are significantly higher than our historical experience  we would recognize an increase in our provision for bad debt in the near future 
in addition  certain of the temporary processing inefficiencies have resulted in delays in certain product shipments  service responsiveness and potential inaccuracies in calculated sales compensation 
these issues  coupled with certain revisions to our billing practices  could have a negative impact on customer service and satisfaction  which could result in a potential loss of business 
we are now engaged in a period of stabilization and clean up  as is typical of a large erp implementation and we anticipate this transition will be completed during although no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in the time periods expected  other than the temporary increase in working capital requirements  we do not anticipate that these issues will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or future cash flows 
pitney bowes has been and is expected to continue to be a significant customer 
revenues from pitney bowes  exclusive of equipment sales to pbcc for lease to the end user  accounted for approximately of our total revenue in both and and of our total revenue in however  no assurance can be given that pitney bowes will continue to purchase our products and services 
in connection with the distribution  imagistics and pitney bowes entered into a non exclusive intellectual property agreement that allowed us to operate under the pitney bowes brand name for a term of up to two years after the distribution 
in  we began introducing new products under the imagistics brand name and we initiated a major brand awareness advertising campaign to establish our new brand name 
effective december  we are no longer using the pitney bowes brand name and all new products are introduced under the imagistics brand name 
brand name recognition is an important part of our overall business strategy and we cannot assure you that customers will maintain the same level of interest in our products now that we can no longer use the pitney bowes brand name 
legal matters in connection with the distribution  we agreed to assume all liabilities associated with our business  and to indemnify pitney bowes for all claims relating to our business 
in the course of normal business  pitney bowes has been party to occasional lawsuits relating to our business 
these may involve litigation by or against pitney bowes or imagistics relating to  among other things  contractual rights under vendor  insurance or other contracts  intellectual property or patent rights  equipment  service or payment disputes with customers and disputes with employees 
in connection with the distribution  liabilities were transferred to us for matters where pitney bowes was a plaintiff or a defendant in lawsuits  relating to our business or products 
we have not recorded liabilities for loss contingencies since the ultimate resolutions of the legal matters cannot be determined and a minimum cost or amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated 
in our opinion  none of these proceedings  individually or in the aggregate  would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
environmental matters we are subject to federal  state and local laws intended to protect the environment 
we believe that  as a general matter  our policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to reasonably prevent the risk of environmental damage and financial liability to our company
