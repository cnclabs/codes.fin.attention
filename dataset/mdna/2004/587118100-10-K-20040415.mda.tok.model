item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the men s wearhouse opened its first store in houston  texas in august  and we are now one of the largest specialty retailers of men s suits in the united states and canada 
at january   we operated retail apparel stores with stores in the united states and stores in canada 
our us stores are primarily operated under the brand names of men s wearhouse stores and k g stores in states and the district of columbia 
our canadian stores are operated under the brand name of moores clothing for men in ten provinces 
for  we had revenues of billion and net earnings of million  compared to revenues of billion and net earnings of million in and revenues of billion and net earnings of million in the more significant factors impacting these results are addressed in the results of operations discussion below 
under the men s wearhouse and moores brands  which contributed approximately of our revenues  we target middle and upper middle income men by offering quality merchandise at everyday low prices 
because we concentrate on men s wear to work business attire which is characterized by infrequent and more predictable fashion changes  we believe we are not as exposed to trends typical of more fashion forward apparel retailers  where significant markdowns and promotional pricing are more common 
in addition  because this inventory mix includes business casual merchandise  we are able to meet demand for such products resulting from the trend over the past decade toward more relaxed dress codes in the workplace 
we also strive to provide a superior level of customer service by training our sales personnel as clothing consultants and offering on site tailoring services in each of our stores 
we believe that the quality  value  selection and service we provide to our men s wearhouse and moores customers have been significant factors in enabling us to consistently gain valuable market share within both the us and canadian markets for men s tailored apparel 
in addition  we have expanded our customer base and leveraged our existing infrastructure by completing the rollout of our tuxedo rental program to nearly all of our men s wearhouse stores in early and introducing the program in moores stores in late as a percentage of total revenues  tuxedo rentals have grown from in to in and in these revenues are expected to continue to increase in as the program matures and is extended to the remaining moores stores 
under the k g brand  we target the more price sensitive customer with a value oriented superstore approach 
k g s merchandising strategy emphasizes broad assortments of men s apparel across all major categories  including tailored clothing  casual sportswear  dress furnishings  footwear and accessories 
in addition  of the k g stores operating at january  offer ladies career apparel that is also targeted to the more price sensitive customer 
although k g employees assist customers with merchandise selection  including correct sizing  the stores are designed to allow customers to select and purchase apparel by themselves 
each store also provides on site tailoring services 
like most retailers  our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
in most years  more than of our net sales and more than of our net earnings have been generated during the fourth quarter of each year 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year 
we opened stores in  stores in and stores in expansion is generally continued within a market as long as management believes it will provide profitable incremental sales volume 
historically  new stores have contributed significantly to increases in net sales and have also contributed to increased net earnings 
in  we plan to open approximately eleven new men s wearhouse stores and eight new k g stores and to expand and or relocate approximately twelve existing men s wearhouse stores and one existing k g store 
the average cost excluding telecommunications and point of sale equipment and inventory of opening a new store is expected to be approximately million in although we believe that our ability to increase the number of men s wearhouse stores in the us above will be limited  we believe that additional growth opportunities exist through improving and diversifying the merchandise mix  relocating stores  expanding our k g brand and adding complementary products and services 
we have closed nineteen stores in the three years ended january  generally  in determining whether to close a store  we consider the store s historical and projected performance and the continued desirability of the store s location 
in determining store contribution  we consider net sales  cost of sales and other direct store costs  but exclude buying costs  corporate overhead  depreciation and amortization  financing costs and advertising 
store performance is continually monitored and  occasionally  as regions and shopping areas change  we may determine that it is in our best interest to close or relocate a store 
in  three stores were closed due to substandard performance or lease expiration 
in  five stores were closed due to substandard performance or lease expiration and two stores were closed when their operations were combined with other existing area stores 
in  nine stores were closed due to substandard performance 
we plan to close approximately ten stores in critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the appropriate application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in many instances  this also requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts and disclosures included in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  since future events and conditions and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results will differ from our estimates and such differences could be material to our financial statements 
our accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consistently apply these policies and periodically evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates in light of actual events 
historically  we have found our accounting policies to be appropriate and our estimates and assumptions reasonable 
we believe our critical accounting policies and our most significant estimates are those that relate to inventories and long lived assets  including goodwill  and our estimated liabilities for the self insured portions of our workers compensation and employee health benefit costs 
our inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the average cost method for approximately of our inventory and on the retail inventory method for the remaining 
our inventory cost also includes estimated procurement and distribution costs warehousing  freight  hangers and merchandising costs associated with the inventory  with the balance of such costs included in cost of sales 
we make assumptions  based primarily on historical experience  as to items in our inventory that may be damaged  obsolete or salable only at marked down prices and reduce the cost of inventory to reflect the market value of these items 
if actual damages  obsolescence or market demand is significantly different from our estimates  additional inventory write downs could be required 
in addition  procurement and distribution costs are allocated to inventory based on the ratio of annual product purchases to average inventory cost 
if this ratio were to change significantly  it could materially affect the amount of procurement and distribution costs included in cost of sales 
we make judgments about the carrying value of long lived assets  such as property and equipment and amortizable intangibles  and the recoverability of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
we test for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances dictate 
to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  including goodwill  we make various assumptions about the future prospects for the brand that the asset relates to and typically estimate future cash flows to be generated by these brands 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
we recorded no impairment charge as a result of our testing performed during or we self insure portions of our workers compensation and employee medical costs 
we estimate our liability for future payments under these programs based on historical experience and various assumptions as to participating employees  health care costs  number of claims and other factors  including industry trends and information provided to us by our insurance broker 
we also use actuarial estimates with respect to workers compensation 
if the number of claims or the costs associated with those claims were to increase significantly over our estimates  additional charges to earnings could be necessary to cover required payments 
results of operations the following table sets forth the company s results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year net sales cost of goods sold  including buying and occupancy costs 
gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings compared with the following table presents a breakdown of and net sales of the company by stores open in each of these periods in millions net sales increase stores decrease stores opened in stores opened in stores opened before   total   the company s net sales increased million  or  to billion for due mainly to a million increase in clothing and alteration sales and an million increase in tuxedo rental revenues 
our us comparable store sales which are calculated by excluding the net sales of a store for any month of one period if the store was not open throughout the same month of the prior period increased as improvement was experienced in nearly all product categories 
at our core men s wearhouse brand  a increase in unit suit sales helped drive increases in other product categories as well as in alteration sales 
in addition  our tuxedo rental business continued to grow following its rollout to nearly all of the men s wearhouse stores in early with tuxedo rental revenues increasing from of total net sales in to in store traffic also increased  not only from our tuxedo rental customers  but also from efforts started in to increase our mix of opening price point product and to increase our penetration into the traditional clothing market 
in canada  comparable store sales for decreased from due mainly to unusually severe and extended winter weather conditions during the first quarter  a shorter summer sale period during the second quarter and softer demand overall in the canadian men s apparel market experienced throughout however  this decrease was more than offset by the foreign currency exchange rate translation effect from the strengthening of the canadian dollar 
gross margin increased million  or  to million in as a percentage of sales  gross margin increased from in to in this increase in gross margin percentage resulted mainly from continued growth in our tuxedo rental business  which carries a significantly higher incremental gross margin impact than our clothing sales  and from higher cumulative mark ups that produced higher clothing product margins 
the gross margin percentage was also increased as occupancy cost  which is relatively constant on a per store basis and includes store related rent  common area maintenance  utilities  repairs and maintenance  security  property taxes and depreciation  decreased modestly as a percentage of sales from to however  on an absolute dollar basis  occupancy costs increased by from to due mainly to higher rent expense from our increased store count and renewals of existing leases at higher rates and increased depreciation 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales  were in compared to in  with sg a expenditures increasing by million or to million 
on an absolute dollar basis  advertising increased by million  store salaries increased by million and other sg a increased by million 
as a percentage of sales  advertising expense decreased from to  store salaries increased from to and other sg a expenses increased from to 
on an absolute dollar basis  the principal components of sg a expenses increased primarily due to i the elimination of media spending reductions imposed in  ii increased commissions and bonuses due to higher sales  iii increased store and warehouse salaries  benefits and other costs associated with a increase in unit tuxedo rentals  iv increased non store salaries  benefits and other costs related to our expansion strategies and v higher insurance costs 
sg a expenses were reduced by the recognition of a million deferred pretax gain from the sale  in march  of certain technology assets to an unrelated company regularly engaged in the development and licensing of software to the retail industry see other matters herein 
however  the gain recognized was more than offset by million in costs related to store closures  million in costs related to the write off of certain technology assets and million in litigation costs related to certain california lawsuits 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased from million in to million in weighted average borrowings outstanding increased million from the prior year to million in  and the weighted average interest rate on outstanding indebtedness decreased from to 
the increase in the weighted average borrowings was due primarily to the issuance of million of notes in a private placement on october  a portion of the proceeds from the notes was used to repay the balance outstanding on our canadian credit facility 
the decrease in the weighted average interest rate was due primarily to the lower interest rate on the notes 
interest expense was offset by interest income from the investment of excess cash of million in and million in see further discussion of the notes in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources herein 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended january  was compared to for the prior year 
the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory federal rate of primarily due to the effect of state income taxes 
these factors resulted in net earnings of million or of net sales  compared with net earnings of million or of net sales 
compared with the following table presents a breakdown of and net sales of the company by stores open in each of these periods in millions net sales increase stores decrease stores opened in stores opened in stores opened before 
  total   the company s net sales increased million  or  to billion for due primarily to increased sales in us stores opened in and  offset partially by decreased sales from stores opened prior to fiscal comparable store sales for decreased in the us and in canada from the decrease in comparable sales for the us and canadian stores was due mainly to continued weakness in the us and canadian economies 
sales of men s apparel is particularly affected since buying patterns for men are considered to be more discretionary than those in other apparel areas 
gross margin increased million  or  to million in as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased from in to in this decrease in gross margin percentage predominately resulted from an increase in occupancy cost which is relatively constant on a per store basis as a percentage of sales and higher markdowns at the men s wearhouse brand associated with a shift to merchandise with lower opening price points 
these decreases in the gross margin percentage were offset in part by our higher margin tuxedo rental revenues increasing from of total revenues in fiscal to of total revenues in fiscal occupancy cost  which includes store related rent  common area maintenance  utilities  repairs and maintenance  security  property taxes and depreciation  increased by on an absolute dollar basis from to due mainly to higher rent expense from our increased store count and renewals of existing leases at higher rates  higher property taxes and increased depreciation 
sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales  were in compared to in  with sg a expenditures increasing by million or to million 
on an absolute dollar basis  advertising decreased by million  store salaries increased by million and other sg a decreased by million 
as a percentage of sales  advertising expense decreased from to  store salaries increased from to and other sg a expenses decreased from to 
the decrease in advertising was due to planned reductions in media spending 
the increase in store salaries was the result of higher sales commission rates in for promotional and other merchandise sales categories 
these commission rates were put in place to help drive the shift to lower opening price points for merchandise offerings at the men s wearhouse brand 
other sg a expenses decreased due to our focus on reducing corporate overhead 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased from million in to million in weighted average borrowings outstanding decreased million from the prior year to million in  and the weighted average interest rate on outstanding indebtedness decreased from to 
the decrease in the weighted average borrowings resulted primarily from decreased short term borrowings under our credit facilities 
the decrease in the weighted average interest rate was due primarily to decreases during in the libor rate 
interest expense was offset by interest income from the investment of excess cash of million in and million in see liquidity and capital resources discussion herein 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended february  was compared to for the prior year 
the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory federal rate of primarily due to the effect of state income taxes 
these factors resulted in net earnings of million or of net sales  compared with net earnings of million or of net sales 
liquidity and capital resources in january  we replaced our existing million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature in february with a new revolving credit agreement with a group of banks the credit agreement that provides for borrowing of up to million through february  with extensions for up to two years under certain conditions 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the stock of the subsidiaries of the men s wearhouse  inc advances under the new credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  the agent s prime rate or the reserve adjusted libor rate plus a varying interest rate margin up to 
the credit agreement also provides for fees applicable to unused commitments ranging from to 
the terms and conditions of the new credit agreement are substantially the same as those of the replaced facility 
in addition  in january  we entered into a new canadian term credit agreement under which we borrowed can million us million which was used to repay approximately can million us million in outstanding indebtedness of moores under the previous term credit agreement 
on october   we repaid the outstanding indebtedness of can million us million 
as of january   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain restrictive and financial covenants  including the requirement to maintain a minimum level of net worth and certain financial ratios 
the credit agreement also prohibits payment of cash dividends on our common stock 
we are in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement as of january  on october   we issued million of notes in a private placement 
a portion of the net proceeds from the notes was used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our canadian term credit agreement and to repurchase shares of our common stock under the program authorized by the board in september see below  the balance is reserved for general corporate purposes  which may include additional purchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on april and october of each year  beginning on april  the notes will mature on october  however  holders may require us to purchase all or part of the notes  for cash  at a purchase price of of the principal amount per note plus accrued and unpaid interest on october   october  and october  or upon a designated event 
beginning on october   we will pay additional contingent interest on the notes if the average trading price of the notes is above a specified level during a specified period 
in addition  we may redeem all or a portion of the notes on or after october   at of the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest  contingent interest and additional amounts  if any 
we also have the right to redeem the notes between october  and october  if the price of our common stock reaches certain levels 
during certain periods  the notes are convertible by holders into shares of our common stock initially at a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share of common stock subject to adjustment in certain events  under the following circumstances if the closing sale price of our common stock issuable upon conversion exceeds of the conversion price under specified conditions  if we call the notes for redemption  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions 
upon conversion of the notes  in lieu of delivering common stock we may  at our election  deliver cash or a combination of cash and common stock 
the notes are general senior unsecured obligations  ranking on a parity in right of payment with all our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and our other general unsecured obligations  and senior in right of payment with all our future subordinated indebtedness 
the notes are effectively subordinated to all of our senior secured indebtedness  and all indebtedness and liabilities of our subsidiaries 
in december  we acquired the assets and operating leases for retail dry cleaning and laundry facilities and issued a note payable for million as partial consideration 
the unsecured note payable is due in full in and interest compounds annually at 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit agreement 
we had working capital of million  million and million at the end of  and  respectively 
historically  our working capital has been at its lowest level in january and february  and has increased through november as inventory buildup is financed with both vendor payables and credit facility borrowings in preparation for the fourth quarter selling season 
working capital at the end of fiscal year is higher than fiscal year and due mainly to our increased inventory levels and cash balances 
our operating activities provided net cash of million in  million in and million in mainly because cash provided by net earnings  as adjusted for non cash charges  and increases in payables and accrued expenses more than offset cash used for other assets  inventories and and decreases in income taxes payable and 
inventory increased million in  but decreased million in a modest increase in net sales in  combined with our inventory levels at the end of and a modification to our inventory mix at our men s wearhouse stores to increase our offering of opening price point product  resulted in lower planned inventory purchases through most of however  our buying patterns normalized in the last quarter of and resulted in an increase of million in payables and accrued expenses for the year 
in  inventories increased million as sales increased and we continued our normal buying patterns 
the increase of million in payables and accrued expenses was due to the increased inventories as well as higher bonuses earned as a result of increased sales and higher insurance costs 
other assets increased in each of the years primarily due to increased investment in tuxedo rental merchandise 
income taxes payable decreased in and mainly due to reduced earnings in and a lower effective tax rate associated with the mix of federal and state earnings in  the increase in income taxes payable in resulted from increased earnings and the timing of tax payments  offset in part by a further reduction in the effective tax rate 
our investing activities used net cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively  due mainly to capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures relate to costs incurred for stores opened  remodeled or relocated during the year or under construction at the end of the year  distribution facility additions and infrastructure technology investments 
however  during  cash used for capital expenditures was partially offset by million of net proceeds received from the sale of certain technology assets to an unrelated company regularly engaged in the development and licensing of software to the retail industry 
approximately million of this amount was recognized as a pretax operating gain by the company in the first quarter of see other matters herein 
during  our cash used by investing activities also included million for net assets acquired 
the following table details our capital expenditures in millions new store construction relocation and remodeling of existing stores information technology distribution facilities other total property additions relating to new retail apparel stores include stores in various stages of completion at the end of the fiscal year three stores at the end of  no stores at the end of and eight stores at the end of 
our expenditures for the relocation and remodeling of existing retail apparel stores continue to be substantial as we have opened fewer new stores 
capital expenditures in also include approximately million for expansion of our tuxedo distribution facility and additional material handling equipment and million for two new concept stores under construction at the end of we used net cash in financing activities of million in and million in mainly for net payments of long term debt and purchases of treasury stock 
as previously noted  we entered into a new canadian credit facility which was a term credit agreement under which we borrowed can million us million in january borrowings under the term credit agreement were used to repay approximately can million us million in outstanding indebtedness of moores under the previous term credit agreement 
in  net cash used in financing activities was million due mainly to proceeds received from the issuance of the notes in october and proceeds from the issuance of our common stock for options exercised  offset by purchases of treasury stock and the repayment of our canadian term loan 
the treasury stock purchases were made under stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors in january  january  november and september under the first three authorized programs  we repurchased   and  shares of our common stock during  and  respectively  at a cost of million  million and million  respectively 
the average price per share of our common stock repurchased under these programs was  and during  and  respectively 
in september  the board of directors authorized a program for the repurchase of up to million of company common stock in the open market or in private transactions 
this authorization superceded the approximately million we had remaining under the board s november authorization 
as of january   we had repurchased under this program  shares at a cost of million in private transactions and  shares at a cost of million in open market transactions 
under all programs during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of million with an average repurchase price of per share 
in connection with our share repurchase programs  we from time to time issued put option contracts and received premiums for doing so  with the premiums being added to our capital in excess of par and effectively reducing the cost of our share repurchases 
under these contracts  the contract counterparties had the option to require us to purchase a specific number of shares of our common stock at specific strike prices per share on specific dates 
during  we issued a put contract for  shares and received a premium of million for issuing this contract 
the contract counterparty had the option to exercise this contract at a strike price of per share on december   but contract completion was required earlier if the market price of our common stock fell below a trigger price of per share 
during the third quarter of  the market price of our common stock fell below the trigger price and we settled the contract by repurchasing the  shares at per share or million  we recorded the shares purchased as treasury stock 
we were not obligated to issue any shares under the put contract nor were we obligated to settle in cash 
our primary cash requirements are to finance working capital increases as well as to fund capital expenditure requirements which are anticipated to be approximately million for this amount includes the anticipated costs of opening approximately eleven new men s wearhouse stores and eight new k g stores in at an expected average cost per store of approximately million excluding telecommunications and point of sale equipment and inventory 
it also includes approximately million for development of distribution facilities in houston for our k g brand and future business models 
the balance of the capital expenditures for will be used for telecommunications  point of sale and other computer equipment and systems  store relocations  remodeling and expansion and investment in complimentary services and concepts 
the company anticipates that each of the eleven new men s wearhouse stores and each of the eight new k g stores will require  on average  an initial inventory costing approximately million and million  respectively subject to the same seasonal patterns affecting inventory at all stores  which will be funded by our revolving credit facility  trade credit and cash from operations 
the actual amount of future capital expenditures and inventory purchases will depend in part on the number of new stores opened and the terms on which new stores are leased 
additionally  the continuing consolidation of the men s tailored clothing industry may present us with opportunities to acquire retail chains significantly larger than our past acquisitions 
any such acquisitions may be undertaken as an alternative to opening new stores 
we may use cash on hand  together with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of equity securities  to take advantage of significant acquisition opportunities 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our various credit agreements  will be sufficient to fund planned store openings  other capital expenditures and operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
as substantially all of our cash is held by five financial institutions  we are exposed to risk of loss in the event of failure of any of these parties 
however  due to the creditworthiness of these five financial institutions  we anticipate full performance and access to our deposits and liquid investments 
in connection with our direct sourcing program  we may enter into purchase commitments that are denominated in a foreign currency primarily the euro 
we generally enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations related to such commitments 
as these forward exchange contracts are with two financial institutions  we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by these parties 
however  due to the creditworthiness of these major financial institutions  full performance is anticipated 
we may also be exposed to market risk as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates 
this market risk should be substantially offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying transactions 
contractual obligations as of january   the company is obligated to make cash payments in connection with its long term debt  operating leases and purchase obligations in the amounts listed below 
in addition  we utilize letters of credit primarily for inventory purchases 
at january   letters of credit totaling approximately million were issued and outstanding 
contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt a operating lease base rentals b purchase obligations c total contractual obligations a long term debt includes our million convertible senior notes issued in october and a million unsecured note payable due in these borrowings are further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table assumes our long term debt is held to maturity 
b we lease retail business locations  office and warehouse facilities  copier equipment and automotive equipment under operating leases 
leases on retail business locations specify minimum base rentals plus common area maintenance charges and possible additional rentals based upon percentages of sales 
most of the retail business location leases provide for renewal options at rates specified in the leases 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
c included in purchase obligations are our forward exchange contracts 
at january   we had contracts maturing in varying increments to purchase an aggregate notional amount of million in foreign currency  maturing at various dates through january see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases  forward exchange contracts and letters of credit discussed above  the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to its financial position or results of operations 
other matters in january  we formed chelsea market systems  llc chelsea  a joint venture company  for the purpose of developing a new point of sale software system for the company and after successful implementation  exploring the possibility of marketing the system to third parties 
under the terms of the agreement forming chelsea  we owned of chelsea and harry m 
levy  a former director and officer  owned with the understanding that mr 
levy would assign  either directly or indirectly  some of his interest in chelsea to other persons involved in the project 
the point of sale system was developed and successfully deployed by the company during and from january though march  we funded and recognized as expense all of the operating costs of chelsea  which aggregated million 
on march   chelsea sold substantially all of its assets  primarily certain technology assets  to an unrelated company regularly engaged in the development and licensing of software to the retail industry 
as a result of the sale by chelsea  the company received a net amount of million 
approximately million of this amount was recognized as a pretax operating gain by the company in the first quarter of impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revised interpretation of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
revised december fin r 
fin r requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity 
fin r is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin r must be applied no later than december  for entities meeting the definition of special purpose entities  and no later than fiscal periods ending after march  for all other entities under construction 
as we do not have any variable interest entities  the adoption of fin r is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

these forward looking statements may include  but are not limited to  future capital expenditures  acquisitions including the amount and nature thereof  future sales  earnings  margins  costs  number and costs of store openings  demand for clothing  market trends in the retail clothing business  currency fluctuations  inflation and various economic and business trends

future results will also be dependent upon our ability to continue to identify and complete successful expansions and penetrations into existing and new markets and our ability to integrate such expansions with our existing operations 
expansion into more fashion oriented merchandise categories or into complementary products and services may present greater risks 
we are continuously assessing opportunities to expand complementary products and services related to our traditional business  such as corporate apparel sales and retail dry cleaning establishments  as well as concepts that include more fashion oriented merchandise 
we may expend both capital and personnel resources on such business opportunities which may or may not be successful 
our business is particularly sensitive to economic conditions and consumer confidence 
consumer confidence is often adversely impacted by many factors including local  regional or national economic conditions  continued threats of terrorism  acts of war and other uncertainties 
we believe that a decrease in consumer spending will affect us more than other retailers because men s discretionary spending for items like tailored apparel tends to slow faster than other retail purchases 
according to industry sources  sales in the men s tailored clothing market generally have declined over the past several years 
we believe that this decline is attributable primarily to men allocating less of their income to tailored clothing and certain employers relaxing their dress codes 
we believe that this decrease in sales has contributed  and will continue to contribute  to a consolidation among retailers of men s tailored clothing 
despite this overall decline  we have been able to increase our share of the men s tailored clothing market  however  we may not be able to continue to expand our sales volume or maintain our profitability within our segment of the retailing industry 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to exposure from fluctuations in us dollar euro exchange rates 
as further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial information and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to limit exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
at january   we had contracts maturing in varying increments to purchase an aggregate notional amount of million in foreign currency  maturing at various dates through january at february   we had four contracts maturing in varying increments to purchase an aggregate notional amount of million in foreign currency  maturing at various dates through march unrealized pretax losses on these forward contracts totaled approximately million at february  unrealized pretax gains on these forward contracts totaled approximately million at january  a hypothetical change in applicable january  forward rates would increase or decrease this pretax gain by approximately million related to these positions 
however  it should be noted that any change in the value of these contracts  whether real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
moores conducts its business in canadian dollars 
the exchange rate between canadian dollars and us dollars has fluctuated over the last ten years 
if the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar weakens  then the revenues and earnings of our canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of our canadian net assets in us dollars may decline
