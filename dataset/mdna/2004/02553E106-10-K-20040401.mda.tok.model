item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ 
the company bases its estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believes them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
see also note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company records revenue for store sales upon the purchase of merchandise by customers 
the company s e commerce and catalog business records revenue at the time the goods are shipped 
revenue is not recorded on the purchase of gift cards 
a current liability is recorded upon purchase and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
revenue is recorded net of sales returns 
revenue is not recorded on the sell off of end of season  overstock and irregular merchandise to off price retailers 
these sell offs are typically sold below cost and the proceeds are reflected in cost of sales 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
inventory 
merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market  utilizing the retail method 
average cost includes merchandise design and sourcing costs and related expenses 
the company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and generally uses markdowns to clear merchandise 
if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price  additional markdowns may be necessary 
these markdowns have an adverse impact on earnings  which may or may not be material  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
the company also estimates a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
asset impairment 
the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
management evaluates the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that have been open longer than one year 
assets are evaluated for impairment when undiscounted future cash flows are projected to be less than the carrying value of those assets 
when events such as these occur  the assets are adjusted to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  additional losses may be recorded 
goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  management evaluates goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the company s reporting units to the book value 
the fair value of the company s reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow model 
based on the analysis  if the implied fair value of each reporting unit exceeds the book value of the goodwill  no impairment loss is recognized 
during the three months ended november   the company believed that certain indicators of impairment were present related to the bluenotes goodwill 
as a result  the company performed an interim test of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
the company completed step one and determined that impairment was likely  which also required the completion of step two 
due to the significant assumptions required for this test  the company retained an independent third party to perform a step two analysis and to validate management s assumptions used in step one 
although the third party valuation was still pending as of november   management believed that a loss was probable and determined its best estimate at that time in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 as supplemented by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
as a result  the company recorded an million estimated impairment loss during the three months ended november  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the independent third party valuation of the bluenotes reporting unit was completed 
based upon the step one analysis  it was concluded that the fair market value of the bluenotes reporting unit was below the book value of the business 
the company completed the step two analysis and allocated the fair value  as determined by the valuation firm  to the existing assets and liabilities and determined that the remaining carrying value of the goodwill was impaired 
as a result  the company recorded an additional million loss during the fourth quarter of fiscal as of january   the book value related to the bluenotes goodwill was zero 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes 
the company calculates income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized 
legal proceedings and claims 
the company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of the conduct of its business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  management records a reserve for estimated losses when the amount is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
if a range of possible loss exists  the company records the accrual at the low end of the range  in accordance with fin  an interpretation of sfas no 
as the company has provided adequate reserves  it believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the financial position of the company 
results of operations overview fiscal was a challenging year 
our merchandise assortments were not clearly focused on our target customers  resulting in negative comparable store sales 
higher markdowns and increased promotional activity were necessary to clear through the inventory units 
this resulted in a lower average unit retail price  which was the primary driver of the decline in comparable store sales 
consolidated net sales for fiscal increased to billion from billion for fiscal  while our consolidated comparable store sales decreased compared to the corresponding period last year 
gross profit as a percent to sales declined to for fiscal from for the same period last year 
the decline in our gross profit margin was primarily due to the deleveraging of rent expense as a result of weak comparable store sales 
we were also not able to leverage selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of the negative comp store sales  which increased from to  as a percent to sales 
during fiscal  we recognized a million goodwill impairment charge due to the continued weak performance of the bluenotes segment 
reported net income for fiscal  which includes the goodwill impairment charge  decreased to million  or per diluted share 
adjusted net income  which excludes the goodwill impairment charge  decreased to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in the prior year 
despite a challenging year  we ended fiscal with million in cash and short term investments  an increase of million from last year 
and we continued to make significant investments in our business  including approximately million in capital expenditures  which related primarily to our new and remodeled american eagle stores in the us and canada 
in response to disappointing results  we made a number of changes throughout the company 
we upgraded our merchandising and design process  and added new creative talent in key positions 
across operating functions  we focused on improving productivity and strengthened operating disciplines 
and importantly  during fiscal  we interviewed over  of our customers 
this research led to adjustments to our product line 
going forward  our merchandise assortments are planned to be clearly targeted at our to year old customers  with a strong value message and an emphasis on key items

non gaap measure disclosure the following definitions are provided for the non gaap generally accepted accounting principles measures used by the company in this form k 
these measures are adjusted net income and adjusted diluted income per common share 
each use is indicated by an asterisk 
we do not intend for these non gaap measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures 
other companies may define the measures differently 
adjusted financial results adjusted net income and adjusted diluted income per common share exclude the non cash goodwill impairment charges of million related to our bluenotes operation

our primary outflows of cash for operations are for the purchase of inventory  operational costs  and the payment of taxes 
net cash provided by operating activities of million during fiscal reflected changes in working capital as well as an increase in non cash charges  depreciation and amortization  and the goodwill impairment loss offset by lower net income compared to the same period last year 
the changes in working capital were primarily due to the timing of income tax payments and a reduction in cash used for inventory purchases

application of the provisions of fin r for all other entities is effective for the first reporting period ending after march  the company has no interest in any entity considered a special purpose entity  therefore  the initial adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on the company 
management is currently performing an evaluation of the effect  if any  that the adoption of the remaining provisions of fin r may have on the company 
however  this adoption is not anticipated to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
certain relationships and related party transactions the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries have various transactions with related parties 
the company believes that the terms of these transactions are as favorable to the company as those that could be obtained from unrelated third parties 
the nature of the company s relationship with these related parties and a description of the respective transactions are as follows as of january   the schottenstein deshe diamond families the families owned of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company 
the families also own a private company  schottenstein stores corporation ssc  which owns linmar realty company and also includes a publicly traded subsidiary  retail ventures  inc rvi  formerly value city department stores  inc the company had the following transactions with these related parties during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal the company leases its distribution center and headquarters offices from linmar realty company

income taxes as of january   we had deferred tax assets of million associated with foreign tax loss carryforwards 
we anticipate that future taxable income in canada will be sufficient to utilize the full amount of the deferred tax assets 
assuming a effective tax rate  we will need to recognize pretax net income of approximately million in future periods to recover this deferred tax amount 
a valuation allowance was provided against the deferred tax asset that resulted from a capital loss carryforward in the amount of million 
management believes that it is not likely that the previously identified tax strategies will enable the company to utilize the capital loss carryforward prior to the july expiration date 
the effective tax rate used for the provision of income tax approximated 
the increase in the effective tax rate during fiscal was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of million for which no income tax benefit was recorded 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation deflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our net sales or our profitability 
substantial increases in cost  however  could have a significant impact on our business and the industry in the future 
additionally  while deflation could positively impact our merchandise costs  it could have an adverse effect on our average unit retail price  resulting in lower sales and profitability 
safe harbor statement  seasonality and risk factors this report contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following the planned opening of approximately american eagle stores in the united states and canada in fiscal  the selection of approximately stores in the united states for remodeling  the sufficiency of existing cash and investment balances  cash flows and line of credit facilities to meet fiscal cash requirements  and the possibility of growth through acquisitions and or internally developing new brands 
we caution that these statements are further qualified by factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including without limitation  the following our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends in a timely manner the company s future success depends  in part  upon its ability to identify and respond to fashion trends in a timely manner 
the specialty retail apparel business fluctuates according to changes in the economy and customer preferences  dictated by fashion and season 
these fluctuations especially affect the inventory owned by apparel retailers  since merchandise typically must be ordered well in advance of the selling season 
while we endeavor to test many merchandise items before ordering large quantities  we are still susceptible to changing fashion trends and fluctuations in customer demands 
in addition  the cyclical nature of the retail business requires that we carry a significant amount of inventory  especially during our peak selling seasons 
we enter into agreements for the manufacture and purchase of our private label apparel well in advance of the applicable selling season 
as a result  we are vulnerable to changes in consumer demand  pricing shifts  and the timing and selection of merchandise purchases 
changes in fashion trends  if unsuccessfully identified  forecasted or responded to by the company  could  among other things  lead to lower sales  excess inventories and higher markdowns  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the effect of competitive pressures from other retailers and other business factors the specialty retail industry is highly competitive 
the company competes primarily on the basis of quality  fashion  service  selection and price 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully compete in the future 
the success of the company s operations also depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment  consumer debt  interest rates  and consumer confidence 
there can be no assurance that consumer spending will not be negatively affected by general or local economic conditions  thereby adversely impacting the company s continued growth and results of operations 
our ability to expand through new store growth the company s continued growth and success will depend in part on its ability to open and operate new stores on a timely and profitable basis 
during fiscal  the company plans to open approximately new american eagle stores in the united states and canada 
accomplishing the company s new store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors  including the ability to obtain suitable sites for new stores at acceptable costs  the hiring and training of qualified personnel  particularly at the store management level  the integration of new stores into existing operations  the expansion of the company s buying and inventory capabilities and the availability of capital 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve its store expansion goals  manage its growth effectively  successfully integrate the planned new stores into the company s operations or operate its new stores profitably 
our ability to successfully reposition the bluenotes brand the company s future earnings depend  in part  upon its ability to successfully reposition the bluenotes brand 
the bluenotes business began incurring operating losses during fiscal due to a combination of factors  including i an abrupt change to the target customer and merchandising strategy  ii adjusting the merchandise fit to a smaller size  iii a merchandise product assortment that was skewed too high in price points and not consistent with the brand strategy  iv a marketing approach that was too narrow in scope  v a lack of sourcing efficiencies and vi increased competitive pressure 
the company made management changes in the bluenotes division in and has implemented new merchandising and operating strategies 
however  the bluenotes business continued to under perform and incurred an operating loss of approximately million during fiscal see note of the consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  the bluenotes business continues to face challenges  including the installation of a new design team and increased competitive pressures 
if the business trend does not improve and the company is not successful repositioning the bluenotes brand  management may need to evaluate potential strategic alternatives for this division during fiscal based on the unanticipated and continued weak performance of the bluenotes division during fiscal  the company believed that certain indicators of impairment were present 
as a result  the company performed an interim test of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
during the quarter ended november  the company completed step one and determined that impairment was likely  which also required the completion of step two 
due to the significant assumptions required for this test  the company retained a third party to perform an independent step two analysis and to validate management s assumptions used in step one 
although the third party valuation was still pending as of november   management believed that a loss was probable and determined its best estimate at that time in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 as supplemented by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
as a result  the company recorded an million estimated impairment loss during the quarter ended november  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the independent third party valuation of the bluenotes reporting unit was completed 
based upon the step one analysis  it was concluded that the fair market value of the bluenotes reporting unit was below the book value of the business 
the company completed the step two analysis and allocated the fair value  as determined by the valuation firm  to the existing assets and liabilities and determined that the remaining carrying value of the goodwill was impaired 
as a result  the company recorded an additional million loss during the fourth quarter of fiscal see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the interruption of the flow of merchandise from key vendors  including the effect of the elimination of the quota the company purchases merchandise from domestic and foreign suppliers 
during fiscal  a majority of the company s merchandise was purchased from foreign suppliers 
since we rely on a small number of overseas sources for a significant portion of our purchases  any event causing the disruption of imports including the insolvency of a significant supplier or a significant labor dispute  such as a dock strike could have an adverse effect on our operations 
other events which could also cause a disruption of imports include the imposition of additional trade law provisions or import restrictions  such as increased duties  tariffs  anti dumping provisions  increased custom s enforcement actions  or political or economic disruptions 
additionally  a majority of the merchandise imported by the company has been subject to import quotas 
these quotas restrict the quantity of a given textile or apparel product that can be exported on an annual basis from a given country 
as of january   the us has agreed to phase out these quotas 
this phase out of textile and apparel quotas  and the resulting removal of country specific restrictions on the quantity of goods that can be imported into the us  could have a significant impact on worldwide sourcing patterns during the fourth quarter of fiscal as well as in however  the extent of this impact  if any  and the possible effect on the company s purchasing patterns and costs  can not be determined at this time 
we do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase from any single supplier 
seasonality historically  our operations have been seasonal  with a significant amount of net sales and net income occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter  reflecting increased demand during the year end holiday selling season and  to a lesser extent  the third quarter  reflecting increased demand during the back to school selling season 
during fiscal  the third and fourth fiscal quarters accounted for approximately of our sales 
as a result of this seasonality  any factors negatively affecting us during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of any year  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year 
our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons  the number and timing of new store openings  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the timing and level of markdowns  store closings  refurbishments and relocations  competitive factors  weather and general economic conditions 
other risk factors additionally  other factors could adversely affect our financial performance  including factors such as our ability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses  any interruption of our key business systems  any disaster or casualty resulting in the interruption of service from our distribution centers or in a large number of our stores  any interruption of key services provided by third party vendors  changes in weather patterns  the effects of changes in current exchange rates and interest rates  and international and domestic acts of terror 
the impact of all of the previously discussed factors  some of which are beyond our control  may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results in these statements and other forward looking statements we may make from time to time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has market risk exposure related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on cash equivalents and investments 
the impact on cash and investments held at the end of fiscal from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would be a decrease in interest income of approximately million during fiscal foreign exchange rate risk we are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate risk primarily through our canadian operations where the functional currency is the canadian dollar 
the recent weakening of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar has positively impacted our net sales and any operating income generated by our canadian businesses  however it has negatively impacted any operating losses generated by our canadian businesses  specifically bluenotes 
as of january   a change in the canadian foreign exchange rate would result in an increase or decrease in our net income of approximately million during fiscal we are also subject to foreign exchange transaction exposure when our canadian businesses purchase inventory in us dollars 
the company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts from time to time to mitigate this risk 
however  the company does not have any foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of january
