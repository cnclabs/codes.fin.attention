our former performance materials segment  engineered industrial products segment  avionics business and passenger restraint systems business prs have been accounted for as discontinued operations 
unless otherwise noted herein  disclosures pertain only to our continuing operations 
overview we are one of the largest worldwide suppliers of aerospace components  systems and services to the commercial  regional  business and general aviation markets 
we are also a leading supplier of aircraft and satellite systems products to the global military and space markets 
our business is conducted on a global basis with manufacturing  service and sales undertaken in various locations throughout the world 
our products and services are principally sold to customers in north america  europe and asia 
for  we reported net income of million  or per diluted share 
sales for were  million 
for  we reported net income of million  or per diluted share 
sales for were  million 
the increase in sales of million from to resulted primarily from incremental sales of approximately million in from the acquisition of the trw aeronautical systems businesses on october  the increase in sales was offset in part by reduced sales for products associated with commercial aircraft original equipment production and aftermarket parts and services 
net income for both years included certain charges as described in the results of operations and business segment performance sections 
during the first quarter of  we completed the sale of our avionics business for million of proceeds net of fees and expenses that resulted in a gain of million reported as income from discontinued operations 
cash flow from operating activities was million in and million in cash flow from operating activities included tax refunds of million in and million in worldwide pension contributions increased from million in to million in cash flow from operating activities in also was reduced by approximately million for several cash disbursements related to the acquisition of aeronautical systems for which we have submitted claims to northrop grumman 
included in cash flow from operating activities in was approximately million resulting from the sale of an interest rate swap and million from the sale of hedges acquired in the acquisition of aeronautical systems 
net cash from investing activities was million in and a use of cash of billion in  primarily as a result of the acquisition of aeronautical systems 
long term debt and capital lease obligations  including current maturities of long term debt and capital lease obligations  at december  were  million  including quips debentures of million 
long term debt and capital lease obligations  including current maturities of long term debt and capital lease obligations  at december  was  million  which excluded million of quips debentures 
at december  we had cash and marketable securities of million as compared to million at december  the reduction in debt and increase in cash and marketable securities from levels resulted from cash flow from operating activities  the proceeds from the sale of the noveon pik notes and the proceeds from the sale of our avionics business 
we maintain a committed syndicated revolving credit facility expiring in august that permits borrowing  including letters of credit  up to a maximum of million 
at december  there were no borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit under this facility 
in addition  at december   we had borrowing capacity under this facility of million  after reductions for outstanding letters of credit 
we also maintain million of uncommitted domestic money market facilities and million of uncommitted foreign working capital facilities with various banks to meet short term borrowing requirements 
at december   there were no borrowings under these facilities 
we maintain a shelf registration that allows us to issue up to billion of debt securities  series preferred stock  common stock  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units 
based upon our current expectations  our sales are expected to grow in the low single digit percent range compared to the outlook for operating income and earnings per share eps is based upon many external and internal factors that may have a material impact on operating income and eps 
see outlook for a list of certain of these factors 
we expect fully diluted eps to be in the range of to 
we expect cash flow from operations  minus capital expenditures  to approximate net income in we expect capital expenditures in to be approximately to million 
our business balance across the aerospace and defense markets continues to be an important strategic aspect of our business 
the three major market areas for our products and services each represent around one third of total sales  and we believe that trends in these markets will have an important impact on future sales 
looking at our sales by market channel  military and space sales represented percent of sales  total commercial aircraft original equipment sales  including regional  business and general aviation original equipment sales  represented percent of our sales and total commercial aircraft aftermarket sales for these same aircraft and for heavy maintenance represented percent of sales 
other areas  including industrial gas turbine components  made up the remaining percent 
overall  our aftermarket sales for both commercial aircraft and in the military and space markets represented about percent of total sales 
comparing the full year sales for and  including a comparable full year contribution of aeronautical systems in  sales to the military and space market increased about percent  sales to the large commercial aircraft and regional  business and general aviation original equipment markets were down by about percent  and sales to the large commercial aircraft aftermarket decreased by about three percent 
we believe that we may have seen the bottom of the downturn in the commercial aerospace market during important to the direction of trends in these market channels is the sequential trends by quarter 
when the market channel data is looked at sequentially  comparing fourth quarter to third quarter  we see some positive signs in all market channels 
large commercial aircraft original equipment sales increased by about three percent  and original equipment sales for the regional  business and general aviation market increased almost six percent 
with respect to the large commercial aircraft aftermarket  those sales increased more than four percent  while military and space sales continued to be strong with a sequential increase of more than five percent 
we used these trends to help determine the market assumptions contained in the outlook 
in  we remain focused on improving our operational and financial performance and on specific enterprise wide goals  including margin improvement and strong cash flow 
we continue to invest in new products and systems that are expected to fuel our future growth 
outlook our outlook is based on the following market assumptions deliveries of boeing and airbus large commercial aircraft are expected to be flat to slightly declining when compared to the deliveries in capacity in the global airline system  as measured by available seat miles asms  is expected to grow for the first time since we continue to expect modest asm growth in the three to five percent range 
our sales to airlines for large commercial and regional aircraft aftermarket parts and service are expected to grow approximately in line with increases in capacity 
regional and business new aircraft production is expected to increase by about eight to percent 
military sales oe and aftermarket should increase roughly in line with global military budgets  in the seven to percent range 
based on current expectations for these key market trends  our sales are expected to grow in the low single digit percent range  compared to the outlook for operating income and earnings per share eps is based on many external and internal factors that may have a material impact on operating income and eps 
these factors include  but are not limited to certain expenses included in corporate general and administrative costs  other income expense and segment operating results are expected to increase by approximately million  in the aggregate  in compared to the increase  compared to the prior outlook of a to million increase in these expenses  is primarily due to a change in our incentive compensation plan  which replaced a portion of the annual stock option grant with restricted stock 
stock based compensation we will begin expensing stock options during for the full year  we expect that stock option expense will be approximately million pre tax about per diluted share 
pension expense we expect pension costs to be approximately million pre tax lower than  due to higher than previously anticipated pension plan asset levels driven by strong equity markets in the fourth quarter foreign exchange for  we are currently hedged on about percent of our estimated foreign exchange exposure 
the recent weakening of the us dollar  especially against the canadian dollar  the euro and the great britain pound sterling  is expected to negatively impact income by approximately to million pre tax  compared to  based on current exchange rates 
e and a spending combined spending on these two programs is expected to be relatively flat in compared to as the reductions in spending on the airbus a program are expected to be largely offset by increased spending on the boeing e program 
change in contract accounting we changed certain elements of the contract accounting methodology utilized at our aerostructures business  effective january   to better align with industry practices 
we expect a one time increase to income  which will be recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting  of approximately million pre tax about per diluted share 
the application of this method should result in approximately million about per diluted share of lower operating income in which would have been recognized as products under these contracts ship throughout the year 
this change has no impact on cash flow from operations 
taking these items into account  we expect fully diluted eps to be in the range of to 
eps from continuing operations  which excludes the one time gain from the cumulative effect of accounting change but includes the ongoing negative impact of this accounting change and stock option expensing  is expected to be between to 
eps outlook outlook eps from continuing operations diluted cumulative effect of change in accounting beginning of year net income diluted eps includes change in accounting operating income impact stock based compensation we expect cash flow from operations  minus capital expenditures  to approximate net income in we expect capital expenditures in to be approximately to million 
the current earnings and cash flow outlook assumes that there will not be any premiums associated with early retirement of debt  material developments with respect to the pending rohr and coltec tax litigation or contractual disputes with northrop grumman related to the purchase of the aeronautical systems business 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  year ended december  dollars in millions sales segment operating income corporate general and administrative costs total operating income net interest expense other income expense net income tax expense distribution on trust preferred securities income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations cumulative effect of an accounting change net income included in the results from continuing operations for was increased pension expense  from million in to million in the increase in pension expense was primarily due to the weak performance of the us and international equity markets in  in which approximately percent of the us qualified defined benefit pension plans trust funds assets were invested 
approximately percent of pension expense in related to the business segments 
foreign exchange also negatively impacted the financial results in our business segments 
approximately percent of our revenues and percent of our costs are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
over percent of these net costs are in euros  great britain pounds sterling and canadian dollars 
we hedge a portion of our exposure on an ongoing basis 
when the us dollar weakens  our unhedged net costs rise in us dollar terms 
on a weighted basis  the us dollar declined about percent against these currencies in changes in sales and segment operating income are discussed within the business segment performance section below 
corporate general and administrative costs of million for the year ended december  increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to higher non qualified pension costs and higher incentive compensation costs 
corporate general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales were percent in the year ended december  and december  net interest expense increased million  or percent  primarily due to interest of million on the million of long term debt issued in the fourth quarter of to partially finance the acquisition of aeronautical systems 
net interest expense also increased due to lower interest income of million  primarily due to the sale of the noveon pik notes in the first quarter of lower short term debt in as compared to somewhat mitigated interest expense by approximately million 
other income expense net increased by million  or percent  to expense of million in the year ended december  from expense of million in the year ended december  the increase in expense resulted from the impairment of our equity investment in cordiem llc of million in and the absence in of an million gain on the sale of an intangible asset and a million gain from the sale of a portion of an investment in a subsidiary sold in these items were offset in part by several favorable items  including a gain on the sale of the noveon pik notes of million  favorable foreign exchange of million  affiliate income of million and favorable employee benefit and divested operations costs of million 
our effective tax rate from continuing operations was percent during the year ended december  and percent during the year ended december  the higher effective tax rate in compared to was due to lower tax benefits from export sales  a higher incremental us tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and the write off of in process research and development with no tax benefit in income loss from discontinued operations  after tax  was million during the year ended december  primarily representing the million gain on the sale of the avionics business in the first quarter of income loss from discontinued operations for the avionics and prs operating results was a loss of million in the year ended december  and income of million in the year ended december  our prs business ceased operations in the first quarter of also included in income loss from discontinued operations was a loss of million in the year ended december  for the engineered industrial products segment which was spun off to shareholders on may  a charge of million for a court ruling related to an employee benefit matter of a discontinued business and fees and expenses related to the spin off of the segment contributed to the loss 
the cumulative effect of an accounting change for the year ended december  of a loss of million  after tax  represents the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
we established a liability for contractual obligations for the retirement of long lived assets 
the cumulative effect of an accounting change for the year ended december  of a loss of million  after tax  represents the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
based upon the impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined that goodwill relating to the aviation technical services ats reporting unit  reported in the airframe systems segment  had been impaired 
as a result  we recognized an impairment charge  representing total goodwill of the aviation technical services reporting unit 
the goodwill write off was non deductible for tax purposes 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  year ended december  dollars in millions sales segment operating income corporate general and administrative costs total operating income net interest expense other income expense net income tax expense distribution on trust preferred securities income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations cumulative effect of an accounting change net income changes in sales and segment operating income are discussed within the business segment performance section below 
corporate general and administrative costs of million for the year ended december  decreased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december  corporate general and administrative costs  as a percent of sales  slightly increased in such costs  as a percent of sales  were percent and percent in and  respectively  primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs in due to our lower stock price at the end of the year  partially offset by costs incurred during associated with the goodrich name change 
net interest expense decreased million  or percent  from million in to million in the decrease was due to an increase in interest income from the noveon pik notes resulting from months of interest income in compared to months of interest income in in addition  interest income in included million relating to the settlement of a contract dispute on the f program 
the impact of increased borrowings to finance the acquisition of the aeronautical systems businesses in october was offset by declines in the average interest rates on short term financings 
we also had higher short term debt prior to the performance materials sale during the first quarter of when interest rates were at significantly higher levels than later in and other income expense net decreased million  or percent  to expense of million in from expense of million in the decrease resulted from the gain on the sale of an intangible asset of million and the gain on the sale of a minority interest in a business of million  offset in part by the settlement of litigation and legal fees of million  increased minority interest expense of million and lower income from a captive insurance company of million 
other income expense net in included a gain of million for the sale of a minority interest in a business 
our effective tax rate from continuing operations was percent and percent and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to was due to a lower tax benefits from export sales which was due to the lower sales volume in  higher incremental us tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and the write off of in process research and development with no tax benefit in income loss from discontinued operations  after tax  was a million loss during the year ended december  and million of income during the year ended december  income loss from discontinued operations for the avionics and prs operating results was income of million in the year ended december  our prs business ceased operations in the first quarter of also included in income loss from discontinued operations was a loss of million in the year ended december  for the eip segment which was spun off to shareholders on may  a charge of million for a court ruling related to an employee benefit matter of a discontinued business and fees and expenses related to the spin off of the segment contributed to the loss 
discontinued operations for the year ended december  included million of income for the performance materials segment for two months including a gain on the sale of the segment of million 
operating income was million for eip and million for avionics and prs 
the cumulative effect of an accounting change was million  after tax  for the year ended december  during the second quarter of  we performed the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
based on those results  we determined that it was likely that goodwill relating to the ats reporting unit  reported in the airframe systems segment  had been impaired 
during the third quarter of  we completed our measurement of the goodwill impairment and recognized an impairment charge of million representing total goodwill of this reporting unit  which was nondeductible for income tax purposes and was reported as a cumulative effect of an accounting change retroactively to january  business segment performance our operations are reported as three business segments airframe systems  engine systems and electronic systems 
an expanded analysis of net customer sales and operating income by business segment follows 
in the following tables  segment operating income is total segment revenue reduced by operating expenses directly identifiable with that business segment 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  year ended december  of sales change dollars in millions net customer sales airframe systems engine systems electronic systems total sales segment operating income airframe systems engine systems electronic systems segment operating income airframe systems airframe systems segment sales of  million in the year ended december  increased million  or percent  from  million in the year ended december  the increase was due to sales associated with the acquisition of aeronautical systems businesses included in this segment  which represented about million in sales for the first nine months of excluding the effect of the acquisition  sales decreased approximately million from last year primarily due to lower volume for landing gear original equipment oe  wheel and brake repair services and heavy airframe maintenance 
airframe systems segment operating income decreased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease in operating income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to decreased sales for landing gear  wheel and brake repair services and heavy airframe maintenance  increased pension expense  unfavorable foreign exchange  an impairment charge related to the boeing program in and a favorable insurance settlement in the second quarter these items impacting reductions in operating income were partially offset by increased sales for aftermarket wheels and brakes in and a charge for inventory  capitalized sales incentives and supplier termination costs relating to the fairchild dornier and programs in the second quarter operating income for the aeronautical systems businesses in the airframe systems segment resulted in a slight loss for the year ended december  asset impairments in  including rotable landing gear  facility closure and headcount reduction charges  were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million inventory step up adjustment related to the acquisition of aeronautical systems 
the inventory for aeronautical systems business in the airframe systems segment was increased to record the inventory at its fair market value at the time of acquisition 
subsequent sale of the acquired inventory increased cost of sales and reduced our profit margins 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge for in process research and development 
the charge reflects the valuation of the actuation and flight controls business in process research and development projects that had not reached technical feasibility and had no alternative future use 
engine systems engine systems segment sales in the year ended december  of  million increased million  or percent  from  million in the year ended december  the increase was due to sales associated with the acquisition of aeronautical systems businesses included in this segment  which represented approximately million in sales for the first nine months of excluding the effect of the acquisition  sales decreased approximately million from the year ago period 
lower aerostructures oe and aftermarket spares sales and a decline in the demand for industrial gas turbine components  resulting in lower sales of engine components and fuel delivery systems  were offset partially by higher sales of aerostructures military and maintenance  repair and overhaul mro businesses 
engine systems operating income decreased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  operating profit was lower due to reduced volume  higher initial costs for the next generation cargo system introduced in the first quarter of and higher pension expense 
in addition  operating profit was lower due to a contract termination in february as described in the subsequent event section below which resulted in a charge of million for the impairment of excess over average inventory of million and million for forward losses relating to the reduction in forecasted contract revenue and the increase in costs 
the lower profit was mitigated by better cost controls in the aerostructures and engine components businesses as we now benefit from prior downsizings 
the aeronautical systems businesses included in the engine systems segment contributed a modest operating profit to the segment s operating income 
included in the year ended december  were write downs of inventory and long term receivables relating to the super re engining program of million and an impairment of a facility that is now held for sale of million 
the write down of the super re engining program is described in detail at contingencies super program 
during  million of contract loss provisions on five contracts were recorded in the aerostructures businesses and were partially offset by approximately million of favorable reserve adjustment related to the implementation of new sap systems 
the loss provisions resulted from increased overhead rates due  in part  to a lower manufacturing base as volume declined consistent with the lower level of aircraft production rates 
in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million inventory step up adjustment related to the acquisition of aeronautical systems 
the inventory for aeronautical systems business in the engine systems segment was increased to record the inventory at its fair market value at the time of acquisition 
subsequent sale of the acquired inventory increased cost of sales and reduced our profit margins 
restructuring and consolidation and other asset impairment costs in the year ended december  were million compared to million in the year ended december  electronic systems sales of the electronic systems segment of  million in the year ended december  increased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to sales associated with the acquisition of the aeronautical systems businesses included in this segment  which represented million in sales for the first nine months of excluding the effect of the acquisition  sales decreased approximately million 
the slight decrease in sales was due to weaker demand for our aircraft evacuation slides and seats  fuel monitoring systems and optical space systems businesses partially offset by stronger sales in propulsion products  sensor systems and lighting systems 
electronic systems segment operating income decreased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  operating income was unfavorably affected by lower sales in optical space systems  new program investments  primarily at aircraft electrical power systems and aircraft evacuation slides and seats businesses  unfavorable foreign currency exchange and higher pension expense 
the aeronautical systems businesses included in the electronic systems segment contributed a profit in the year ended december  restructuring and consolidation costs included in operating income were million and million in the year ended december  and december   respectively 
in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million inventory step up adjustment related to the acquisition of aeronautical systems 
the inventory for aeronautical systems business in the electronic systems segment was increased to record the inventory at its fair market value at the time of acquisition 
subsequent sale of the acquired inventory increased cost of sales and reduced our profit margins 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  year ended december  of sales change dollars in millions net customer sales airframe systems engine systems electronic systems total sales segment operating income airframe systems engine systems electronic systems segment operating income airframe systems airframe systems segment sales of  million in the year ended december  increased million  or percent  from  million in the year ended december  the increase was due to sales associated with the aeronautical systems businesses included in this segment that represented about million in sales in the year ended december  excluding these businesses  sales decreased approximately million from the year ago period primarily due to lower demand for commercial landing gear original equipment  aftermarket wheels and brakes and heavy airframe maintenance and landing gear services 
airframe systems segment operating income increased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  asset impairments including rotable landing gear  facility closure and headcount reduction charges were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million inventory step up adjustment related to the acquisition of aeronautical systems 
the inventory for aeronautical systems business in the airframe systems segment was increased to record the inventory at its fair market value at the time of acquisition 
subsequent sale of the acquired inventory increased cost of sales and reduced our profit margins 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge for in process research and development 
the charge reflects the valuation of the actuation and flight controls business for in process research and development projects that had not reached technical feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in  we recorded a million inventory adjustment that resulted from decreased demand due to september  after consideration of the effects of the above items  the decrease in operating income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to decreased sales for landing gear  wheel and brake repair services and heavy airframe maintenance and a favorable insurance settlement in the second quarter these items impacting reductions in operating income were partially offset by a charge for inventory  capitalized sales incentives and supplier termination costs relating to the fairchild dornier and programs in the second quarter operating income for the aeronautical systems businesses in the airframe systems segment resulted in a slight loss for the year ended december  engine systems engine systems segment sales in the year ended december  of  million decreased million  or percent  from  million in the year ended december  sales associated with the aeronautical systems businesses included in this segment approximated million in sales in the year ended december  excluding these businesses  sales decreased approximately million from the year ago period 
the decrease resulted from our aerostructures  engine components and fuel delivery systems businesses 
the aerostructures sales decline resulted from lower production volumes on most boeing and airbus programs and a substantial decline in the sale of spare parts for out of production aircraft 
these sales declines were largely due to the reduction of older aircraft by airlines subsequent to september  sales of spare parts for in production aircraft increased in from  however  sales were partially offset by a decline in sales on the super re engining program 
sales at our aerostructures maintenance repair and overhaul facilities declined slightly from our engine components and fuel delivery systems volume was reduced by excess capacity in the power generation market in engine systems operating income decreased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  operating profits overall were lower in from lower sales volume 
during  million of contract loss provisions on five contracts were recorded in our aerostructures businesses and were partially offset by approximately million of favorable reserve adjustment related to the implementation of new sap systems in the loss provisions resulted from increased overhead rates due  in part  to a lower manufacturing base as volume declined consistent with the lower level of aircraft production rates 
in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million inventory step up adjustment related to the acquisition of aeronautical systems 
the inventory for aeronautical systems business in the engine systems segment was increased to record the inventory at its fair market value at the time of acquisition 
subsequent sale of the acquired inventory increased cost of sales and reduced our profit margins 
restructuring costs  including severance and consolidation costs  were million in in the year ended december   aerostructures recorded an inventory write down for million for our investment in the boeing and super re engining programs due to reduced expectations for these programs 
the reduced expectation for the boeing program relates to boeing s announced production schedule reduction for this program during the fourth quarter of the reduction in expectations for the super program was primarily due to deteriorating economic conditions and september  in addition  the segment recorded million in restructuring and consolidation costs in these costs were incurred in response to the decline in volume resulting from reduced oe build rates and lower spare parts sales resulting from the general industry economic decline subsequent to september  electronic systems sales of the electronic systems segment of million in the year ended december  increased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to sales associated with the aeronautical systems businesses included in this segment and the acquisition of hella lighting systems in the second quarter  which represented million in sales 
higher sales were also reported for our optical space systems business primarily due to awards of classified cost type contracts 
sales declined in the aircraft evacuation slides and seats  de icing specialty systems  sensors and fuel monitoring systems businesses mainly due to lower demand for original equipment and aftermarket products in all of the commercial  regional and business aircraft subsequent to september  electronic systems segment operating income decreased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  operating income was lower due to reduced volume as noted above  higher investments in new program awards  weaker product mix with less sales in aftermarket and unfavorable operating inefficiencies as a result of not fully realizing cost reduction benefits associated with the restructuring programs that has been initiated 
restructuring costs were million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million inventory step up adjustment related to the acquisition of aeronautical systems 
the inventory for aeronautical systems business in the electronic systems segment was increased to record the inventory at its fair market value at the time of acquisition 
subsequent sale of the acquired inventory increased cost of sales and reduced our profit margins 
subsequent event on february  we were notified by pratt whitney  a united technologies company  that it will not have requirements for original equipment pw engine nacelle components after we complete delivery of shipsets units per shipset through early we had originally forecasted shipsets to be delivered through as a result of this action  our total estimated revenue associated with this contract has been significantly reduced and anticipated cost reductions related to future deliveries under this contract will not occur 
the notice of termination is considered a type subsequent event under generally accepted accounting principles  the effects of which must be reflected in our financial statements 
as a result  we have recorded a pre tax charge of million  as of december  related to this contract 
the charge includes impairment of excess over average inventory of million and million for forward losses relating to the reduction in forecasted contract revenue and the increase in costs 
foreign operations we are engaged in business in foreign markets 
our manufacturing and service facilities are located in australia  canada  china  england  france  germany  india  indonesia  mexico  poland  scotland and singapore 
we market our products and services through sales subsidiaries and distributors in a number of foreign countries 
we also have joint venture agreements with various foreign companies 
currency fluctuations  tariffs and similar import limitations  price controls and labor regulations can affect our foreign operations  including foreign affiliates 
other potential limitations on our foreign operations include expropriation  nationalization  restrictions on foreign investments or their transfers  and additional political and economic risks 
in addition  the transfer of funds from foreign operations could be impaired by the unavailability of dollar exchange or other restrictive regulations that foreign governments could enact 
we do not believe that such restrictions or regulations would have a materially adverse effect on our business  in the aggregate 
sales to non us customers were  million or percent of total sales   million or percent of total sales  and  million or percent of total sales  for  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we currently expect to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs from a combination of cash  internally generated funds and financing arrangements 
we believe that our internal liquidity  together with access to external capital resources  will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans and also provide adequate financial flexibility 
cash at december   we had cash and marketable securities of million  as compared to million at december  credit facilities in august  we replaced our syndicated revolving credit facilities composed of a three year facility expiring in december and a day facility expiring in september with a new committed syndicated revolving credit facility expiring in august the new facility permits borrowing  including letters of credit  up to a maximum of million compared to million under the previous facilities and otherwise has similar terms and is with the same group of global banks as the previous facilities 
at december   there were no borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit under this facility 
at december   there were million in borrowings and million in letters of credit under the previous facilities 
during the first quarter of  all amounts borrowed under the previous facilities were repaid with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our avionics business  cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of certain non operating assets 
the level of unused borrowing capacity under our committed syndicated revolving credit facility varies from time to time depending in part upon our consolidated net worth and leverage ratio levels 
in addition  our ability to borrow under this facility is conditioned upon compliance with financial and other covenants set forth in the related agreement  including a consolidated net worth requirement and maximum leverage ratio 
we are currently in compliance with all such covenants 
as of december   we had borrowing capacity under this facility of million  after reductions for outstanding letters of credit 
we also maintain million of uncommitted domestic money market facilities and million of uncommitted foreign working capital facilities with various banks to meet short term borrowing requirements 
as of december   there were no borrowings under these facilities 
at december   million was borrowed under these facilities 
these uncommitted credit facilities are provided by a small number of commercial banks that also provide us with committed credit through the syndicated revolving credit facility and with various cash management  trust and other services 
in october  we borrowed billion under a committed syndicated credit agreement expiring in july  to finance the acquisition of aeronautical systems from trw inc during  we repaid billion with the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and long term debt  operating cash flow and the proceeds from the sale of certain non operating assets 
in march  we repaid the balance of million with the proceeds from the sale of the noveon pik notes and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our avionics business 
our credit facilities do not contain any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness 
however  a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in the interest rate and fees payable under our committed syndicated revolving credit facility 
such a downgrade also could adversely affect our ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such new facilities 
in july  standard poor s reduced its rating on our long term senior unsecured debt from bbb to bbb 
the rating change resulted in a small increase in the interest rate and fees payable under our committed syndicated revolving credit facility 
quips at december  and december   there were million and million  respectively  in outstanding cumulative quarterly income preferred securities  series a quips issued by bfgoodrich capital  a delaware business trust trust  all of the common equity of which is owned by us 
the quips are supported by our junior subordinated debentures  series a  due quips debentures 
we have unconditionally guaranteed all distributions required to be made by the trust  but only to the extent the trust has funds legally available for such distributions 
on october   we completed the redemption of approximately million of the quips 
the remaining quips were called for redemption on january  the redemption date will be march  effective october   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 and deconsolidated the trust 
at december   the quips debentures were reported on our consolidated balance sheet as current maturities of long term debt and capital lease obligations 
prior periods have not been restated 
long term financing at december   we had long term debt and capital lease obligations of  million with maturities ranging from to current maturities of long term debt and capital lease obligations at december  were million  including million of the quips debentures 
the earliest maturity of a material long term debt obligation is december we also maintain a shelf registration statement that allows us to issue up to billion of debt securities  series preferred stock  common stock  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units 
in july  we entered into a million fixed to floating interest rate swap on our percent senior notes due in in october  we entered into two million fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
one million swap is on our percent senior notes due in and the other million swap is on our percent medium term notes due in in december  we entered into a million fixed to floating interest rate swap on our percent senior notes due in the purpose of entering into these swaps was to increase our exposure to variable interest rates 
the settlement and maturity dates on each swap are the same as those on the referenced notes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the interest rate swaps are being accounted for as fair value hedges and the carrying value of the notes has been adjusted to reflect the fair values of the interest rate swaps 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize several forms of off balance sheet financing arrangements 
at december   these arrangements included undiscounted minimum future lease receivables in millions payments sold tax advantaged operating leases standard operating leases short term receivables lease agreements we finance our use of certain equipment  including corporate aircraft  under committed lease arrangements provided by financial institutions 
certain of these arrangements allowed us to claim a deduction for the tax depreciation on the assets  rather than the lessor  and allowed us to lease up to a maximum of million at december  at december   million of future minimum lease payments were outstanding under these arrangements 
the other arrangements are standard operating leases 
future minimum lease payments under the standard operating leases approximated million at december  sale of receivables at december   we had in place a variable rate trade receivables securitization program pursuant to which we could sell receivables up to a maximum of million 
accounts receivable sold under this program were million at december  and december  continued availability of the securitization program is conditioned upon compliance with covenants  related primarily to operation of the securitization  set forth in the related agreements 
we are currently in compliance with all such covenants 
the securitization does not contain any credit rating downgrade triggers pursuant to which the program could be terminated 
cash flow hedges we have subsidiaries that conduct a substantial portion of their business in euros  great britain pounds sterling and canadian dollars  but have significant sales contracts that are denominated in us dollars 
periodically  we enter into forward contracts to exchange us dollars for euros  great britain pounds sterling and canadian dollars 
the forward contracts described above are used to mitigate the potential volatility to earnings and cash flow arising from changes in currency exchange rates 
the forward contracts are being accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the forward contracts are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with the offset reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes 
the notional value of the forward contracts at december  was million 
the fair value of the forward contracts at december  was an asset of million  of which million is recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets and million is recorded in other assets 
the total gross gain of million before deferred taxes of million  including terminated forward contracts as discussed below  was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be reflected in income as the individual contracts mature which will offset the earnings effect of the hedged item 
as of december   the portion of the million gain that would be reclassified into earnings to offset the effect of the hedged item as an increase in sales in the next months is a gain of million 
in june  we terminated certain forward contracts prior to their scheduled maturities in and received cash of million 
as of december   accumulated other comprehensive income included a gain of million related to these terminated contracts which will be reflected in income and sales when the original contracts would have matured 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following charts reflect our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  commercial commitments include lines of credit  guarantees and other potential cash outflows resulting from a contingent event that requires performance by us pursuant to a funding commitment 
in millions total thereafter payments due by period contractual obligations short term and long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total amount of commitments that expire per period other commercial commitments lines of credit standby letters of credit bank guarantees guarantees standby repurchase obligations other commercial commitments total as of december   we had in place a a committed syndicated revolving credit facility which expires in august and permits borrowing up to a maximum of million  b million of uncommitted domestic money market facilities and c million of uncommitted foreign working capital facilities 
as of december   we had borrowing capacity under our committed syndicated revolving credit facility of million  after reductions for outstanding letters of credit 
change in dividend policy on may   our board of directors approved a change in our dividend policy to achieve  over time  a net income payout ratio that we believe is consistent with other leading aerospace companies 
specifically  our quarterly cash dividend was reduced to cents per share from the previous level of cents per share on our common stock  effective with the regular quarterly cash dividend payable july   to shareholders of record as of june  cash flow the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for  and net cash provided by used by operating activities of continuing operations investing activities of continuing operations financing activities of continuing operations discontinued operations operating activities of continuing operations net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased million from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities included tax refunds of million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities was reduced by worldwide pension contributions of million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities also includes approximately million for several items related to the acquisition of aeronautical systems for which we have submitted claims to northrop grumman 
see contingencies potential contractual dispute with northrop grumman 
also included in cash provided by operating activities was approximately million resulting from the sale of an interest rate swap agreement associated with million of our long term debt and million of cash received from the sale of hedges acquired as part of the acquisition of aeronautical systems 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted from improved management of accounts receivable and inventory  and lower estimated tax payments in also included in the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million resulting from the sale of an interest rate swap agreement associated with million of our long term debt and million of cash received from the sale of hedges acquired in the acquisition of aeronautical systems 
offsetting the favorable cash flow was a decrease in accounts payable in investing activities of continuing operations net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations was million in the year ended december  and a use of cash of  million in the year ended december  cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  was due to proceeds from the sale of the noveon pik notes of million and the receipt of a million purchase price adjustment related to the acquisition of aeronautical systems offset in part by capital expenditures of million 
cash used by investing activities in the year ended december  resulted primarily from the acquisition of aeronautical systems for  million and capital expenditures of million  offset in part by a payment of million on the noveon pik notes 
capital expenditures for are expected to increase to approximately to million from million expended in we used  million of net cash in investing activities of continuing operations in the year ended december  primarily for the acquisition of aeronautical systems for  million and capital expenditures of million  offset in part by a payment of million on the noveon pik notes 
capital expenditures in the year december  were lower than million in the year ended december  due to the expansion of our carbon producing capabilities in and a large enterprise resource planning project at our aerostructures business that was substantially complete in financing activities of continuing operations net cash used by financing activities of continuing operations was million in the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations of  million for the year ended december  short term debt was repaid during the year ended december  using the net after tax cash proceeds from the sale of our avionics business  cash proceeds from the sale of the noveon pik notes and cash provided by operating activities net of dividends and capital expenditures 
financing activities of continuing operations provided  million of net cash in the year ended december  and used million of net cash in the year ended december  the increase in long term and short term debt and capital stock was to finance the acquisition of aeronautical systems in the primary reason for the increased use of cash in financing activities in was the repayment of short term indebtedness with the proceeds from the performance materials sale 
see the discontinued operations cash flow discussion below 
discontinued operations net cash provided by discontinued operations of million in the year ended december  included million net after tax proceeds from the sale of the avionics business 
net cash used by discontinued operations of million in the year ended december  includes million of cash included in the net assets of the eip business distributed to shareholders  million paid  net of insurance receipts  for asbestos related matters and million relating to capital expenditures and debt repayments 
net cash provided by discontinued operations of million in the year ended december  includes million attributable to the sale of the performance materials business in february contingencies general there are pending or threatened against us or our subsidiaries various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings  all arising from the ordinary course of business with respect to commercial  product liability  asbestos and environmental matters  which seek remedies or damages 
we believe that any liability that may finally be determined with respect to commercial and non asbestos product liability claims should not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
from time to time  we are also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving contract  patent protection  environmental and other matters 
gain contingencies  if any  are recognized when they are realized 
environmental we are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations  including sites at which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under these laws 
the measurement of environmental liabilities by us is based on currently available facts  present laws and regulations and current technology 
such estimates take into consideration our prior experience in site investigation and remediation  the data concerning cleanup costs available from other companies and regulatory authorities and the professional judgment of our environmental specialists in consultation with outside environmental specialists  when necessary 
estimates of our environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination  the range of remediation alternatives available  evolving remediation standards  imprecise engineering evaluations and estimates of appropriate cleanup technology  methodology and cost  the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties  as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 
accordingly  as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed  it is likely that adjustments in our accruals will be necessary to reflect new information 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period  but the amounts  and the possible range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued  are not reasonably estimable 
based on currently available information  however  we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites with which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional future developments  administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a given period 
environmental liabilities are recorded when our liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable  which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when we have recommended a remedy or have committed to an appropriate plan of action 
the liabilities are reviewed periodically and  as investigation and remediation proceed  adjustments are made as necessary 
liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation  and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties  but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar state managed sites and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 
at december   our consolidated balance sheet included an accrued liability for environmental remediation obligations of million  of which million was included in current liabilities as accrued liabilities 
of the million  million was associated with ongoing operations and million was associated with businesses previously disposed of or discontinued 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors that vary by site  including the nature and extent of contamination  the number of potentially responsible parties  the timing of regulatory approvals  the complexity of the investigation and remediation  and the standards for remediation 
we expect that we will expend present accruals over many years  and will complete remediation of all sites with which we have been identified in up to years 
this period includes operation and monitoring costs that are generally incurred over to years 
asbestos we and a number of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various actions by plaintiffs alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibres in products  or which may have been present in our facilities 
a number of these cases involve maritime claims  which have been and are expected to continue to be administratively dismissed by the court 
these actions primarily relate to previously owned businesses 
we believe that pending and reasonably anticipated future actions  net of anticipated insurance recoveries  are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we believe that we have substantial insurance coverage available to us related to any remaining claims 
however  a major portion of the primary layer of insurance coverage for these claims is provided by the kemper insurance companies 
kemper has indicated that  due to capital constraints and downgrades from various rating agencies  it has ceased underwriting new business and now focuses on administering policy commitments from prior years 
we cannot predict the long term impact of these actions on the availability of the kemper insurance 
liabilities of divested businesses asbestos at the time of the eip spin off  two subsidiaries of coltec were defendants in a significant number of personal injury claims relating to alleged asbestos containing products sold by those subsidiaries 
it is possible that asbestos related claims might be asserted against us on the theory that we have some responsibility for the asbestos related liabilities of enpro  coltec or its subsidiaries  even though the activities that led to those claims occurred prior to our ownership of any of those subsidiaries 
also  it is possible that a claim might be asserted against us that coltec s dividend of its aerospace business to us prior to the spin off was made at a time when coltec was insolvent or caused coltec to become insolvent 
such a claim could seek recovery from us on behalf of coltec of the fair market value of the dividend 
a limited number of asbestos related claims have been asserted against us as successor to coltec or one of its subsidiaries 
we believe that we have substantial legal defenses against these claims  as well as against any other claims that may be asserted against us on the theories described above 
in addition  the agreement between enpro and us that was used to effectuate the spin off provides us with an indemnification from enpro covering  among other things  these liabilities 
the success of any such asbestos related claims would likely require  as a practical matter  that coltec s subsidiaries were unable to satisfy their asbestos related liabilities and that coltec was found to be responsible for these liabilities and was unable to meet its financial obligations 
we believe any such claims would be without merit and that coltec was solvent both before and after the dividend of its aerospace business to us 
if we are ultimately found to be responsible for the asbestos related liabilities of coltec s subsidiaries  we believe it would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in a particular period 
however  because of the uncertainty as to the number  timing and payments related to future asbestos related claims  there can be no assurance that any such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if a claim related to the dividend of coltec s aerospace business were successful  it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
other in connection with the divestiture of our tire  vinyl and other businesses  we have received contractual rights of indemnification from third parties for environmental and other claims arising out of the divested businesses 
failure of these third parties to honor their indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
guarantees we have guaranteed amounts owed by coltec capital trust with respect to the million of outstanding tides and have guaranteed coltec s performance of its obligations with respect to the tides and the underlying coltec convertible subordinated debentures 
following the spin off of the eip segment  the tides remained outstanding as an obligation of coltec capital trust and our guarantee with respect to the tides remains an obligation of ours 
enpro  coltec and coltec capital trust have agreed to indemnify us for any costs and liabilities arising under or related to the tides after the spin off 
in addition to our guarantee of the tides  at december   we have an outstanding contingent liability for guarantees of debt and lease payments of million  letters of credit and bank guarantees of million  residual value of leases of million and executive loans to purchase our stock of million 
potential contractual dispute with northrop grumman we have submitted claims to northrop grumman which acquired trw for reimbursement of several items related to our acquisition of the aeronautical systems businesses  which claims totaled approximately million at december  the claims relate to liabilities and obligations that were retained by trw under the purchase agreement  but which have been administered by us since the closing 
northrop has questioned the documentary and contractual support for the claims  and has withheld payment pending resolution of these questions 
we are providing additional information to northrop in order to answer these questions 
commercial airline customers the downturn in the commercial air transport market  the terrorist attacks on september   the military conflict in iraq and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars have adversely affected the financial condition of many of our commercial airline customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations on the financial condition of all of our customers and maintain reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon expected collectibility 
although we believe our reserves are adequate  we are not able to predict the future financial stability of these customers 
any material change in the financial status of any one or group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the extent to which extended payment terms are granted to customers may negatively affect future cash flow 
super program our aerostructures business unit  included in the engine systems segment  includes a business to re engine aircraft to meet sound attenuation requirements and improve their fuel efficiency super program 
at december   we had an investment in the super program of million consisting of of inventory and million of notes receivable 
the inventory included three super aircraft  seven nacelle kits and other spare parts 
in march  we repossessed four aircraft from a receivable obligor who was in financial difficulty and also received a revised cash flow forecast indicating a significant decline in the financial strength of another receivable obligor 
in addition  the deterioration in the commercial airline market resulting from the military conflict in iraq and sars made available more aircraft that compete with or are newer than these aircraft 
because of these events  we concluded that our ability to recover the recorded values of our inventory and notes receivable was significantly affected 
in the first quarter  based on an independent appraisal and our assessment of then current market conditions  we wrote down the carrying value of our inventory to equal the estimated market value of million 
also in the first quarter  we reserved million of related trade receivables and million of notes receivable from a receivable obligor 
as of december   our remaining notes receivable of million represents the present value of expected future cash flows related to those receivables 
the total carrying value of inventory and other assets related to the super business was million and million  respectively  at december  and represents our assessment of the current market value 
we have entered into several transactions for the super assets  which  if consummated according to the contractual requirements  would reduce the remaining book values of these assets to approximately million by the end of the first quarter collection of the notes may be negatively affected if the overall deterioration in the commercial aerospace market and the market continues 
because of these conditions  we will continue to assess the value of these assets and their ultimate recovery 
tax litigation in  coltec made a million payment to the internal revenue service irs for an income tax assessment and the related accrued interest arising out of certain capital loss deductions and tax credits taken in on february   coltec filed suit against the irs in the us court of claims seeking a refund of this payment 
trial is scheduled for may coltec has agreed to pay to us an amount equal to any refunds or credits of taxes and interest received by it as a result of the litigation 
if the irs prevails in this case  coltec will not owe any additional interest or taxes with respect to however  we may be required by the irs to pay up to million plus accrued interest with respect to the same items claimed by coltec in its tax returns for through the potential tax liability for through has been fully reserved 
a reasonable estimation of the potential refund for  if any  cannot be made at this time  accordingly  no receivable has been recorded 
in  the irs issued a statutory notice of deficiency asserting that rohr  inc rohr  our subsidiary  was liable for million of additional income taxes for the fiscal years ended july  through in  the irs issued an additional statutory notice of deficiency asserting that rohr was liable for million of additional income taxes for the fiscal years ended july  through the proposed assessments relate primarily to the timing of certain tax deductions and tax credits 
rohr has filed petitions in the us tax court opposing the proposed assessments 
rohr expects that these cases will go to trial in late or in and that it will ultimately be successful in these cases 
however  if rohr is not successful in these cases  we believe that the net cost to rohr at the time of the final determination by the court would not exceed million  including interest  as the court will take into account the timing benefit of the disallowed tax deductions at that time 
we believe that our best estimate of the liability resulting from these cases has been fully reserved 
new accounting standard the us medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law on december  in accordance with financial accounting standards board staff position accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  the effects of the act on our plans are not reflected in any measure of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or net periodic postretirement benefit cost in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes 
specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and that guidance  when issued  could require us to change previously reported information 
change in accounting methods effective january   we changed certain aspects of the application of contract accounting for our aerostructures business  including a change to the cumulative catch up method from the reallocation method for accounting for changes in contract estimates 
the impact of such changes on our consolidated financial statements is income of approximately million  before tax  or million after tax which will be reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting in the first quarter the application of this method at the segment level is expected to result in approximately million of lower operating income in which would have been recognized as products under these contracts ship throughout the year 
also effective january   we changed our method of accounting for stock based compensation 
we previously accounted for stock based compensation under apb no 
we have adopted the provisions of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for stock based compensation and financial accounting standard no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
as such  we will expense stock options and the shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
the expense will be recognized over the period earned and vested 
the adoption is expected to reduce pre tax income by approximately million  or million  after tax  for critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring  long term service contracts  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition for revenues not recognized under the contract method of accounting  we recognize revenues from the sale of products at the point of passage of title  which is at the time of shipment 
revenues earned from providing maintenance service are recognized when the service is complete 
contract accounting percentage of completion revenue recognition we have sales under long term  fixed priced contracts  many of which contain escalation clauses  requiring delivery of products over several years and frequently providing the buyer with option pricing on follow on orders 
sales and profits on each contract are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting  using the units of delivery method 
we follow the guidelines of statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts the contract method of accounting except that our contract accounting policies differ from the recommendations of sop in that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method rather than the cumulative catch up method 
under the reallocation method  the impact of revisions in estimates related to units shipped to date is recognized ratably over the remaining life of the contract  while under the cumulative catch up method  such impact would be recognized immediately 
effective january   we changed certain aspects of the application of contract accounting for our aerostructures business unit  including a change to the cumulative catch up method from the reallocation method for accounting for changes in contract estimates 
the impact of such changes on our financial statements is income of approximately million  before tax  or million after tax which will be reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting in the first quarter of the application of this method at the segment level is expected to result in approximately million of lower operating income in which would have been recognized as products under these contracts ship throughout the year 
profit is estimated based on the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract  excluding that reported in prior periods  and is recognized evenly in the current and future periods as a uniform percentage of sales value on all remaining units to be delivered 
current revenue does not anticipate higher or lower future prices  but includes units delivered at actual sales prices 
cost includes the estimated cost of the preproduction effort  primarily tooling and design  plus the estimated cost of manufacturing a specified number of production units 
the specified number of production units used to establish the profit margin is predicated upon contractual terms adjusted for market forecasts and does not exceed the lesser of those quantities assumed in original contract pricing or those quantities which we now expect to deliver in the timeframe periods assumed in the original contract pricing 
our policies only allow the estimated number of production units to be delivered to exceed the quantity assumed within the original contract pricing when we receive firm orders for additional units 
the timeframe periods assumed in the original contract pricing is generally equal to the period specified in the contract 
if the contract is a life of program contract  then such period is equal to the time period used in the original pricing model which generally equals the time period required to recover our preproduction costs 
option quantities are combined with prior orders when follow on orders are released 
the contract method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
these estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events  including the quantity and timing of product deliveries 
also included are assumptions relative to future labor performance and rates  and projections relative to material and overhead costs 
these assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements 
we reevaluate our contract estimates periodically and reflect changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 
included in sales are amounts arising from contract terms that provide for invoicing a portion of the contract price at a date after delivery 
also included are negotiated values for units delivered and anticipated price adjustments for contract changes  claims  escalation and estimated earnings in excess of billing provisions  resulting from the percentage of completion method of accounting 
certain contract costs are estimated based on the learning curve concept discussed below 
inventory inventoried costs on long term contracts include certain preproduction costs  consisting primarily of tooling and design costs and production costs  including applicable overhead 
the costs attributed to units delivered under long term commercial contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced and are determined under the learning curve concept  which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
this usually results in an increase in inventory referred to as excess over average during the early years of a contract 
if in process inventory plus estimated costs to complete a specific contract exceeds the anticipated remaining sales value of such contract  such excess is charged to current earnings  thus reducing inventory to estimated realizable value 
identifiable intangible assets identifiable intangible assets are recorded at cost  or when acquired as part of a business combination  at estimated fair value 
these assets include patents and other technology agreements  sourcing contracts  trademarks  licenses  customer relationships and non compete agreements 
intangible assets are generally amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of to years for all acquisitions completed prior to june  for acquisitions completed subsequent to june   identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their useful life using undiscounted cash flows  a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed 
impairments of identifiable intangible assets are recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset  or related groups of assets  may not be recoverable and our estimate of undiscounted cash flows over the assets remaining useful life are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the determination of undiscounted cash flow is based on our segments plans 
the revenue growth is based upon aircraft build projections from aircraft manufacturers and widely available external publications 
the profit margin assumption is based upon the current cost structure and anticipated cost reductions 
measurement of the amount of impairment may be based upon an appraisal  market values of similar assets or estimated discounted future cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset 
sales incentives we offer sales incentives to certain commercial customers in connection with sales contracts 
these incentives may consist of up front cash payments  merchandise credits and or free products 
the cost of these incentives is recognized in the period incurred unless it is specifically guaranteed of recovery within the contract by the customer 
if the contract contains such a guarantee  then the cost of the sales incentive is capitalized and amortized over the contract period 
entry fees investment in risk and revenue sharing programs some aerospace customers may negotiate an entry fee  representing an up front cash investment in a new program 
the payment effectively demonstrates our commitment to participate in new product programs and is part of the exclusive supply agreement 
in return  we receive a percentage of the product sales in the supply periods after flight certification 
entry fees differ from sales incentives  as entry fees are an investment in a program which will generate a benefit from the total sales of the program  not just sales from our products  while sales incentives that are capitalized are recovered during the contract period of our products pursuant to a specific guarantee of recovery by the customer 
the entry fees are recognized as other assets and amortized on a straight line basis over the program s useful life following certification  which approximates years 
the value of the investment is evaluated for impairment based on the criteria in identifiable intangible assets above 
the estimated lives are reviewed periodically based upon the expected program lives as communicated by the customer 
pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the annual expense for our pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions are evaluated by us in consultation with an outside actuary 
changes in assumptions are based upon our historical data  such as the rate of compensation increase and the long term rate of return on plan assets 
assumptions  including the discount rate  the long term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost projections are evaluated at least annually and updated as necessary 
for december   the us discount rate was lowered to percent for both the valuation of pensions and other postretirement benefits other than pensions 
a percent rate of increase in compensation was used for the us plans for december  for postretirement benefits other than pensions  a percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for with the rate gradually decreasing to five percent for and remaining at that level thereafter 
for december   the uk discount rate was percent and the rate of compensation was percent

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities  and on a limited basis  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we intend to use such derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
interest rate exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our outstanding variable rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
at december   a hypothetical basis point unfavorable change in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
in july  we entered into a million fixed to floating interest rate swap on our percent senior notes due in in october  we entered into two million fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
one million swap is on our percent senior notes due in and the other million swap is on our percent medium term notes due in in december  we entered into a million fixed to floating interest rate swap on our percent senior notes due in the purpose of the interest rates swaps was to increase our exposure to variable interest rates 
the settlement and maturity dates on the swaps are the same as those on the notes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the carrying values of the notes have been adjusted to reflect the fair value of the interest rate swap 
the table represents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates excluding the receivables securitization program

these risks include transactions denominated in foreign currencies  the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency and translation of income and expense and balance sheet amounts of our foreign subsidiaries to the us dollar 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to transaction and income risks through our normal operating activities and  where appropriate  through foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
foreign exchange negatively impacted the financial results in our business segments in approximately percent of our revenues and approximately percent of our costs are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
over percent of these net costs are in euros  great britain pounds sterling and canadian dollars 
we hedge a portion of our exposure on an ongoing basis 
when the us dollar weakens  our unhedged net costs rise in us dollar terms 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the statements of income of international businesses into us dollars will affect comparability of revenues and expenses between years 
we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to sell us dollars for great britain pounds sterling  canadian dollars and euros 
these forward contracts are used to mitigate a portion of the potential volatility to cash flows arising from changes in currency exchange rates 
as of december  we had forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy great britain pounds sterling  contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy canadian dollars and contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy euros 
these forward contracts mature on a monthly basis with maturity dates that range from january to april at december   a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies would decrease the value of the forward contracts described above by million 
the fair value of these forward contracts was million at december  because we hedge only a portion of our exposure  a strengthening of the us dollar as described above would have a more than offsetting benefit to our financial results in future periods
