general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
investment securities available for sale 
at december   new valley had investment securities available for sale of  new valley classifies investments in debt and marketable equity securities as either available for sale or held to maturity 
investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value  with net unrealized gains and losses included as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are included in other results from continuing operations 
the cost of securities sold is determined based on average cost 
gains are recognized when realized in new valley s consolidated statement of operations 
losses are recognized as realized or upon the determination of the occurrence of an other than temporary decline in fair value 
new valley s policy is to review its securities on a regular basis to evaluate whether any security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
if it is determined that an other than temporary decline exists in one of new valley s marketable securities  it is new valley s policy to record an impairment charge with respect to such investment in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in  new valley recorded a write down of  related to other than temporary declines of its investment securities 
in  new valley had net increases to unrealized gains on investment securities of  which have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the company s consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity 
investments in non consolidated real estate businesses 
new valley accounts for its interest in douglas elliman realty  llc and in koa investors  llc on the equity method because it has a significant  but less than controlling  interest in these entities 
new valley records its investments in these entities in its consolidated balance sheets as investments in non consolidated real estate businesses and its share of the entities income or loss as equity income loss from non consolidated real estate businesses 
judgment is required in determining controlling interest 
factors considered by new valley in determining whether it has significant influence or has control include risk and reward sharing  experience and financial condition of the other investors  voting rights  involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement 
the difference between consolidation and the equity method impacts certain financial ratios because of the presentation of the detailed line items reported in the financial statements 
however  new valley s consolidated net income or loss for the period and its stockholders equity at the end of the period are the same whether its investments in these entities are accounted for under the equity method or these entities are consolidated 
because new valley does not control the decision making process or business management practices of these entities  it relies on management of these entities and their independent accountants to provide it with accurate financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that new valley uses in the application of the equity method 
new valley is not aware  however  of any errors in or possible misstatements of the financial information provided by these entities that would have a material effect on new valley s consolidated financial statements 
long term investments 
at december   new valley had long term investments of  which principally represented investments in various limited partnerships 
the principal business of the limited partnerships is investing in real estate and investment securities 
these long term investments are illiquid  and the value of the investments is dependant on the performance of the underlying partnership and its management by the general partners 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments  new valley considers the external markets for these types of investments as well as the forecasted financial performance of its investees 
if these forecasts are not met  new valley may have to recognize an impairment charge in its consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes 
the year was the only year out of the last five in which new valley has reported net income 
new valley s losses during these and prior years have generated federal tax net operating loss  or nol  carry forwards of approximately  as of december  and capital loss carry forwards of  which expire at various dates from through new valley also has approximately  of alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards as of december   which may be carried forward indefinitely under current us tax law 
generally accepted accounting principles require that new valley record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with these loss carry forwards if it is more likely than not that new valley will not be able to utilize it to offset future taxes 
due to the size of the loss carry forwards in relation to new valley s history of unprofitable operations and to the continuing uncertainties surrounding its operations as it seeks to acquire additional operating companies  new valley has not recognized any of this net deferred tax asset 
new valley currently provides for income taxes only to the extent that it expects to pay cash taxes primarily state taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax for current income 
it is possible  however  that new valley could be profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize all or a portion of the carry forwards 
upon reaching such a conclusion  new valley would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to its combined federal and state effective rates  which would approximate under current tax rates  rather than the nominal rate currently being used 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause new valley s provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although its cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the loss carry forwards is utilized
