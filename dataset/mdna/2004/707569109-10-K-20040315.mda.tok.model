item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our operations we are a leading  diversified  multi jurisdictional owner and operator of gaming properties  as well as horse racetracks and associated off track wagering facilities  or otws 
we own or operate nine gaming properties located in colorado  illinois  louisiana  mississippi  ontario and west virginia that are focused primarily on serving customers within driving distance of the properties 
we also own two racetracks and eleven otws in pennsylvania  one racetrack in west virginia  and through a joint venture  own and operate a racetrack in new jersey 
we operate in two segments  gaming and pari mutuel operations  and derive substantially all of our revenues from such operations 
since september  when we started our gaming operations at charles town  our gaming revenues have increasingly accounted for a larger share of our total revenues 
we believe that our portfolio of assets provides us with a diversified cash flow from operations 
we intend to continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties and the continued pursuit of strategic acquisitions of gaming properties particularly in attractive regional markets 
we have made significant acquisitions over the last three years and expect to continue to pursue additional acquisition and development opportunities in the future 
on march   we completed our largest acquisition to date  the acquisition of hollywood casino corporation 
we acquired percent of its outstanding common stock for approximately million in cash  including acquisition costs of million 
the hollywood casino corporation acquisition significantly increased our revenues and cash flow 
with the acquisition of hollywood casino corporation in the first quarter of  our gaming revenue accounted for over of our total revenue in gaming revenues are derived primarily from gaming on slot machines and table games 
pari mutuel revenues are derived from wagering on our live races  wagering on import simulcasts at our racetracks and otws and through telephone account wagering  and fees from wagering on export simulcasting our races at out of state locations 
other revenues are derived from hotel  dining  retail  admissions  program sales  concessions and certain other ancillary activities 
key performance indicators related to revenues are gaming revenue indicators slot handle volume indicator  table game drop volume indicator and win or hold percentages  which are not fully controllable by us 
our typical slot win percentage is in the range of to of slot handle and our typical table games win percentage is in the range of to of table game drop  and pari mutuel revenue indicators pari mutuel wagering commissions volume indicator earned on wagering on our live races  wagering on import simulcasts at our racetracks and otws and through telephone account wagering  and fees from wagering on export simulcasting our races at out of state locations 
our properties generate significant operating cash flow since most of our revenue is cash based from slot machines and pari mutuel wagering 
our business is capital intensive and we rely on cash flow from our properties to generate operating cash to repay debt  fund maintenance capital expenditures  fund new capital projects at existing properties and provide excess cash for future development and acquisitions

the continued expansion and revenue gains at our charles town entertainment complex 
the racing revenues continue to decline at each of our racing properties 
however  our gaming revenues have increased and  as a result  our racing revenues represent a less significant percentage of our overall revenue 
recent economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes  as illustrated by our experience in illinois in a number of states are currently considering legislation to legalize or expand gaming 
such legislation presents both potential opportunities to establish new properties for instance in pennsylvania and maine and potential competitive threats to business at our existing properties such as maryland 
the timing and occurrence of these events remain uncertain 
legalized gaming from casinos located on native american lands can also have a significant competitive effect 
financing in a favorable interest environment and under an improved credit profile facilitates our growth

the financial institutions that provided our million senior credit facility required the interest rate swap agreements for the variable rate term loans 
the term loans were repaid in march from the proceeds of our equity and senior subordinated note offerings 
generally accepted accounting principles require the change in fair value of the swaps be recognized in our financial statements as if they were settled at the end of each reporting period until the agreements expire

outlook based on our current level of operations  and anticipated revenue growth  we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that our anticipated revenue growth will be realized  or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facility or otherwise will be available to enable us to service our indebtedness  including the credit facility and the notes  to retire or redeem the notes when required or to make anticipated capital expenditures 
in addition  if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future  our cash requirements may increase significantly 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
our future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance our debt will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control

and hwcc louisiana  inc  which we refer to as the shreveport entities and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the casino  and the partnership interests held by hcs i  inc and hcs ii  inc and the stock held by hwcc louisiana  inc 
on february   our indirect subsidiary  hcs i  inc  the managing general partner of hollywood casino shreveport general partnership  or hcs  announced that its board of directors has initiated a process that it hopes will result in the sale or other disposition of the riverboat casino hotel complex of hcs located in shreveport  louisiana 
the announcement followed action by the board authorizing hcs s financial advisor  libra securities llc  to begin contacting potential acquirers 
the board also authorized the creation of an independent committee to oversee the sale process  consisting of the director who is not employed directly by us 
the board created the independent committee in case we seek to participate as a bidder in the sale process 
the board took action after consultation with an ad hoc committee of holders of the million first mortgage notes due and the million senior secured notes due  which we refer to as the hollywood casino shreveport notes  issued by hcs and its subsidiary shreveport capital corporation 
although no formal agreement has been reached with the ad hoc committee regarding the sale process  hcs anticipates that it will consult with the ad hoc committee throughout the process 
there can be no assurance that the process will result in the sale or other disposition of the riverboat casino hotel complex or that  if it does  the sale proceeds will be adequate to pay the hollywood casino shreveport notes in full 
hcs currently anticipates that any transaction would be effected through a federal bankruptcy proceeding 
hcs did not make the august  and the february  interest payments  aggregating million  due on the hollywood casino shreveport notes 
the hollywood casino shreveport notes have been in default under the terms of their respective note indentures since may  and accordingly are classified as current obligations at december  critical accounting estimates financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods and estimates used in the preparation of financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of our accounting policies  including the estimated lives assigned to our assets  asset impairment  insurance reserves  the purchase price allocations made in connection with our acquisitions and the calculation of our income tax liabilities  require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be those in which our policies  estimates and judgments have a significant impact on issues that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of long lived tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill as a result of our recent acquisitions  intangible assets and goodwill increased significantly 
two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and ii the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in connection with our acquisitions  a valuation was completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices 
upon completion of the valuation process  approximately million was allocated to goodwill and million to the management contract 
the management contract is amortizable under financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas because our goodwill is no longer amortized  there may be more volatility in reported income than under previous accounting standards because impairment losses  if any  are likely to occur irregularly in varying amounts 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgments as to the remaining useful lives of the assets purchased and present value computations for the management services contract 
if growth rates  operating margins  or useful lives  among other assumptions  differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require an acceleration in amortization expense of the management contract 
at december   we had a net property and equipment balance of million  representing of total assets 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
future events such as property expansions  new competition and new regulations  could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring changes in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realizability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
litigation  claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events  as well as assumptions about future events 
if our assessment of such a matter should change  we may have to change the estimate  which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates
