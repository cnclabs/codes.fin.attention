item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those described below  including 
table of contents those risks described in the section entitled  business risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report 
our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of document sciences and its subsidiary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  computer software costs  allowance for doubtful accounts and valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue for all of our license models 
our contracts specifically state the amount of initial and annual license fees due for each type of software licensed 
if an undelivered element of the arrangement exists under the license arrangement  revenue is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we recognize revenue on transactions with payment terms greater than days but less than twelve months from the contract date  if we have a history of successfully collecting from the specific customer without providing concessions 
amounts billed or payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
revenues generated from consulting services are recognized as the related services are performed and collectibility is deemed probable 
however  when such consulting services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the delivered software product  revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized on a percentage of completion method or not until the contract is completed in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and accounting research bulletin arb no 
 long term construction type contracts 
we measure progress under the percentage of completion method  depending on how the contract language is written  either by using the percentage of total project hours completed or by the completion of phases in the consulting project 
because i the phases of our consulting projects are generally not of great duration weeks on average and ii we have a variety of projects progressing at the same time  we believe that there are very limited circumstances where materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
software development costs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and significant enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the product has been established 
after technological feasibility has been established  direct production costs  including programming and testing  are capitalized until general release of the product 

table of contents capitalized costs of software to be sold  licensed or otherwise marketed are amortized using the greater of the amount computed using the ratio of current period product revenues to estimated total product revenues or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic lives of the products 
it is possible that estimated total product revenues  the estimated economic life of the product  or both  will be reduced in the future 
as a result  the carrying amount of capitalized software costs may be reduced in the future  which could cause our operating results in future periods to be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
at the end of each reporting period  we perform a detailed review of outstanding balances by customer and invoice 
we utilize statistical and account specific analysis to determine the adequacy of our reserve  as well as comparing balances to historical losses 
if our assumptions or analysis are incorrect  our operating results for future periods may be adversely affected 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
due to the uncertainty of realizing a portion of these net deferred tax assets  we have maintained a valuation allowance of million for net deferred tax assets 
such uncertainty primarily relates to the potential for future taxable income as well as loss carryforwards and tax credits expiring in and  respectively 
in addition  pursuant to sections and of the internal revenue code  annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of more than within a three year period 
no valuation allowance has been recorded to offset the remaining  of net deferred tax assets as we have determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized within the next twelve months 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of such assets  however  if future events occur which do not make the realization of such assets more likely than not  we will record a valuation allowance against all or a portion of the remaining net deferred tax assets 
examples of future events that might occur which would make the realization of such assets not likely is a lack of taxable income resulting from poor operating results during as a result of our assessment at december   we decreased our valuation allowance by  
table of contents results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table shows the percentage of revenues  cost of revenues  operating expenses and other items to total revenues in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues initial license fees annual renewal license and support fees services and other total revenues cost of revenues initial license fees annual renewal license and support fees services and other total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income loss  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss revenues our revenues are divided into three categories based upon the sources from which they are derived initial license fees  annual renewal license and support fees  and services and other revenues 
we sell our products principally through our direct sales force domestically and through distributors and vars internationally 
the following table summarizes revenues in thousands and the percentage change over the previous year for the periods indicated years ended december  initial license fees annual renewal license and support fees services and other total revenues initial license fees 
initial license fees consist primarily of upfront license fees for the first year of use of our products 
the decrease in was due to the impact of transitioning our marketing and sales effort from one based exclusively on our existing autogragh suite to one focused largely around xpression 
however  sales of 
table of contents our enterprise wide xpression product line often involve more participants in the corporate decision making process than sales of our autograph suite 
we have experienced defects and installation problems on the introduction of our xpression product line that we are working to rectify 
as a result of these factors  we have had difficulties in generating customer references  which are typically required in the industries into which we sell 
in this regard  sales of xpression have been less successful than planned due to transition difficulties  as well as the weak state of the overall economy and the related effect on corporate buying decisions 
the increase in was due to higher sales in the united states  canada and europe  as well as the release of xpression 
additionally  initial license fees benefited from several contracts where customers extended their relationships with us following the expiration of their three year contracts 
such contract extensions totaled million 
the components of initial license fees in thousands consist of the following years ended december  products compuset xpression document library services document viewing services total initial license fees annual renewal license and support fees 
annual renewal license and support fees consist of license fees for the initial and continued use and support of our licensed products 
the increases in and were due to increases in our base of licensed software and in our list prices 
services and other 
services and other revenues consist of fees for consulting  application development and training services performed by us as well as miscellaneous other operational revenues 
the decrease in was largely due to customer delays in initiating contracted projects  as well as the mix of software being licensed that requires fewer services 
cost of revenues the following table summarizes cost of revenues in thousands and the percentage change over the previous year for the periods indicated years ended december  initial license fees annual renewal license and support fees services and other total cost of revenues cost of initial license fees 
cost of initial license fees includes amortization of previously capitalized software development costs  costs of third party software  employment costs for distribution personnel and product packaging 
the decrease in was primarily the result of lower sales and a decrease in the amortization of software due to full amortization of autograph products 
the increase in was primarily the result of higher sales and an increase in the amortization of software due to the general release of xpression 
cost of annual renewal license and support fees 
costs of annual renewal license fees consist principally of the employment related costs for our technical support staff 
the increase in was due to an increase in staff 
table of contents to support xpression 
due to increased efficiencies  our headcount remained about the same in relative to cost of services and other 
costs of services and other consist principally of the employment related costs of our consulting and training staff 
the increase in was due to unbillable time related to the support of  and personnel training in  the use of xpression 
the decrease in was primarily due to attrition and redeployment of personnel to other departments 
operating expenses the following table summarizes operating expenses in thousands and the percentage change over the previous year for the periods indicated years ended december  research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the employment related costs of personnel associated with developing new products  enhancing existing products  testing software products and developing product documentation 
we anticipate that we will continue to direct significant resources to the development and enhancement of our products 
we have extended our development services and referral agreement with objectiva for an additional two years 
effective january   this million agreement will continue to provide us with development services in connection with xpression 
in  objectiva performed of the services of the previous two year agreement and we paid them million 
the following table shows the breakout of capitalized software development costs in thousands and the percentage change over the previous year for the periods indicated years ended december  research and development net capitalized software development costs research and development gross capitalized software development costs mainly include payroll related costs of our engineering resources and consulting fees paid to objectiva in relation to the development of xpression 
the amount of software development costs to be capitalized in the future may change if the time between the establishment of technological feasibility of a product and its general release changes 
the increase in capitalized software development costs in was due to additional resources working on xpression 
the decrease in gross development costs in was primarily due to a  decrease in allocated facility and communication costs   decrease in personnel costs and a  decrease in expenditures for outside consultants 
the increase in capitalized software development costs in was due to development costs of our new product  xpression 
the increase in gross development costs in was primarily due to new expenditures with objectiva 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  marketing programs and related costs for pre and post sales activity 
the increase in was primarily due to a 
table of contents  increase in personnel costs in support of the release of xpression and a  increase in outside sales contractors 
the increase in was primarily due to a  increase in personnel costs and a  increase in trade show and travel costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of employment related costs for finance  administration and human resources  allowance for doubtful accounts and general corporate management expenses  including legal and audit fees 
the increase in was primarily due to a  provision for a european value added tax assessment that we are currently appealing and a  increase in professional fees offset by a  decrease in allocated facility and communication costs 
the decrease in was primarily due to a  decrease in allocated facility and communication costs   decrease in bad debt expense and a  decrease in personnel costs 
other items interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net is composed of interest income from cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  offset by interest expense related to capital leases and notes to xerox and losses on disposals of fixed assets 
interest and other income  net was   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in was the result of less interest income due lower cash balances and lower interest rates 
the decrease in was the result of less interest income due lower cash balances following the million debt payment in february and lower interest rates 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we reserved  of the previously released  of our recorded valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets 
the remaining  provision for income taxes in was due to foreign taxes 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of our net deferred tax assets 
if future events occur that do not make the realization of such assets more likely than not  a valuation allowance will be established against all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets 
trends and factors that may affect future operating results our total revenues and operating results can vary  sometimes substantially  from quarter to quarter and are expected to vary significantly in the future 
our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
future results will depend upon many factors  including the demand for our products  the level of product and price competition  the length of our sales cycle  the size and timing of individual license transactions  the delay or deferral of customer implementations  the budget cycles of our customers  our success in expanding our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  the timing of new product introductions and product enhancements by us and our competitors  the mix of products and services sold  levels of international sales  activities of and acquisitions by competitors  the timing of new hires  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  our ability to develop and market new products  controlling costs and general domestic and international economic conditions 
in addition  our sales generally reflect a relatively high amount of revenue per order  and  therefore  the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on our revenues and quarterly operating results 
in addition  a significant amount of our revenues occur predominantly in the third month of each fiscal quarter and tend to be concentrated in the latter half of that third month 
our software products generally are shipped as orders are received 
as a result  initial license fees in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
the timing of receipt of initial license fees is difficult to predict because of the length of our sales cycle 
for autograph products  our sales cycle is typically three to nine months from initial contact 
for xpression products  our sales cycle is typically six months to over one year from initial contact 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue trends and because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from a limited number of initial license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in losses 
to the extent such expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents due to the foregoing factors  revenues and operating results for any quarter are subject to significant variation  and we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash come mainly from operations and sales and maturities of short term investments 
our main uses of cash are for payroll and outside consultants 
our main project underway is xpression we intend to release this major upgrade in the rd quarter of we do not use any off balance sheet arrangements  equity linked derivatives or stock as a form of liquidity to fund our operations 
we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures at least through the next twelve months 
a portion of our cash could be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
we have no material current understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition in whole of other businesses  products or technologies 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
this is a decrease of million from december  in november  we paid million to xerox to repurchase the remaining  shares of document sciences common stock owned by xerox 
our short term investments are invested in us government agency obligations 
excluding the impact of our million repurchase of common stock  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments remained the same at december  and the primary item that offset our million net loss was our million decrease in accounts receivable 
our receivables decreased million due to lower sales in the fourth quarter of and better collecting of receivables during accrued compensation decreased  due to no bonus accrual at december  other accrued liabilities increased  due to a  provision for a european value added tax assessment that we are currently appealing 
due to more software licensed and higher annual license fees  our deferred revenue increased  cash used in financing activities in related primarily to our repurchase of common stock owned by xerox 
cash used in financing activities in related primarily to the payment of notes to xerox pursuant to our tender offer 
cash used in financing activities in reflected the cash portion of our tender offer 
effective january   we signed another two year development services and referral agreement with objectiva 
we have committed to pay objectiva million over the two year term of the agreement for development services to be provided by a dedicated team 
the agreement is cancelable within days due to material breach 
we owe monthly payments of  through january  objectiva is a software engineering company headquartered in carlsbad  california 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

table of contents tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following information as of december  is shown with respect to known contractual obligations for the periods specified below 
we may disaggregate the specified categories of contractual obligations using other categories suitable to its business  but the presentation must include all of our obligations that fall within the categories specified below 
see item a of reg 
s k 
due in totals less than year years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations totals recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement clarifies the definition of a liability  as currently defined under fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements  as well as other items 
the statement requires that financial instruments that embody an obligation of an issuer be classified as a liability 
furthermore  the standard provides guidance for the initial and subsequent measurement as well as disclosure requirements of these financial instruments 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into after may  the adoption of this statement has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies the financial accounting and reporting requirements  as were originally established in sfas  for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas provides greater clarification of the characteristics of a derivative instrument so that contracts with similar characteristics will be accounted for consistently 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   as well as for hedging relationships designated after june   excluding certain implementation issues that have been effective prior to this date under sfas the adoption of this statement has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin provides guidance on how to apply the controlling financial interest criteria in arb to variable interest entities vie 
given the complexity of fin and implementation issues after its original issuance  particularly with respect to its scope and application of the consolidation model  the fasb staff issued several fasb staff positions throughout to clarify the board s intent on certain of the interpretation s provisions 
in december  the board issued fin r to address certain technical corrections and clarify the implementation issues that had arisen 
in general  a vie is subject to consolidation if it has an insufficient amount of equity for the entity to carry on its principal operations without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties  a group of equity owners that are unable to make decisions about the entity s activities or equity that does not absorb the entity s losses or receive the entity s benefits 
variable interest entities are to be evaluated for consolidation based on all contractual  ownership or other interests that expose their holders to the risks and rewards of the entity 
these interests may include equity investments  loans  leases  derivatives  guarantees  service and management contracts and other instruments whose values change with changes in the vie 
any of these interests may require its holder to consolidate the entity 
the holder of a variable interest that receives the 
table of contents majority of the potential variability in gains or losses of the vie is the vie s primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie 
fin r became effective immediately for entities created after january  we have analyzed whether objectiva would qualify as a vie and whether our interest in objectiva would require consolidation 
based on the provisions of fin r  objectiva qualifies as a business and meets other certain requirements  such that objectiva is not considered a vie and therefore would not require consolidation consideration 
accordingly  our investment in objectiva has been recorded in accordance with the equity method of accounting and thus the investment of  at december  is included in other assets on our balance sheet 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to a certain extent  foreign currency exchange rate movements also affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies on non us based competitors 
our primary foreign currency risk exposure is related to us dollar to euro conversions 
considering the anticipated cash flows from firm sales commitments and anticipated sales for the next quarter  a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not materially adversely affect expected first quarter earnings or cash flows 
this analysis is dependent on actual export sales during the next quarter occurring within of budgeted forecasts 
the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the affect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects described above 
in addition  it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen 
each month  we review our position for expected currency exchange rate movements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our short term available for sale investments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income
