although the company believes that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable and have based these expectations on its beliefs as well as assumptions it has made  these expectations may prove to be incorrect 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations include  without limitation  the following the company s status as a start up company with only five years of operating history  the effect of extensive banking regulation on the bank s ability to grow and compete  the effect of changes in federal economic and monetary policies on the bank s ability to attract deposits  make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads  the competitive disadvantage resulting from the company s status as a highly regulated  start up company  the company s dependence on key management personnel  the increased risk of losses due to loan defaults caused by the bank s commercial loan concentration  the company s dependence on a favorable local economy in the bank s primary service area  the bank s dependence on net interest spread for profitability  the bank s ability to implement developments in technology to be competitive  failure of a significant number of borrowers to repay their loans  general changes in economic conditions  including interest rates and real estate values  and restrictions imposed on the company by regulators or regulations of the banking industry

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes that its critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
allowance for loan losses 
the company s allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
additions to the allowance may result from recording provision for loan losses and recoveries  while charge offs are deducted from the allowance 
allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only  and the entire allowance is available to absorb probable and estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the company has an established process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that relies on various procedures and pieces of information to arrive at a range of probable outcomes 
no single statistic or measurement  in itself  determines the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance has three components identified specific allocation  a percentage allocation based on loss history for different loan groups  and unallocated 
to determine the allocated component of the allowance  the company combines estimates allowances required for specifically identified loans that are analyzed individually and loans that are analyzed on a group basis 
first  management allocates specific portions of the allowance for loan losses based on identifiable problem loans 
problem loans are identified through a loan risk rating system and monitored through watchlist reporting 
specific allocations of allowance for loan losses are determined for each identified credit based on delinquency rates  collateral and other risk factors identified for that credit 
second  management s evaluation of the allowance for different loan groups is based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  industry concentrations within the loan portfolio and general economic conditions  and absent the ability of some of those factors  based upon peer industry data of comparable banks 
lastly  the unallocated component of the allowance is maintained to supplement the allocated component and to recognize the imprecision of estimating and measuring loss when evaluating loss allocations for individual loans or pools of loans 
the allocated and the unallocated components represent the total allowance for loan losses that would adequately cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the level of allowance and  correspondingly  the provision for loan losses  rests upon estimates and assumptions  including past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions and other factors 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for smaller balance loans of a similar nature such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
commercial loans and mortgage loans secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment 
when analysis of a borrower s operating results and financial condition indicates that underlying cash flows of the borrower s business are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements  the loan is evaluated for impairment 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
financial condition the company experienced its fifth year of significant growth during total assets of the company were  at december  compared to  at december   an increase of  or 
the significant increase in assets was mainly attributable to growth in the loan portfolio and was funded by a significant growth in deposits and fhlb advances 
asset growth has been substantial during each year since the bank began operations 
the significant growth during previous years was also a result of deposit growth at the bank 
as the bank enters its sixth year of operation  management anticipates that  in the near term  assets will increase at a rate similar to the bank s historical trends as management continues to market its institution  products and banking expertise  deliver a high level of customer service and develop its branch network 
earning assets 
the company s loan portfolio experienced another year of significant growth during loans were  at december  compared to  at december   an increase of  or 
the loan portfolio  which equaled and of earning assets at december  and  respectively  was primarily comprised of commercial and commercial real estate loans at both dates 
at december   commercial and commercial real estate loans were approximately of the loan portfolio and represented loans to business interests generally located within the bank s market area 
approximately of the loan portfolio at december  consisted of general commercial and industrial loans primarily secured by inventory  receivables and equipment  while of the loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans primarily secured by real estate 
the largest concentrations of credit within the commercial category are represented by owner occupied and investment real estate at  or of total loans  and building  development and general contracting at  or of total loans 
the concentration and growth in commercial credits is in keeping with the bank s strategy of focusing a substantial amount of efforts on commercial banking 
business banking is an area of expertise for the bank s management and lending team 
residential mortgage and home equity lending  while only of loans at december   also experienced significant growth 
consumer loans  only of total loans at december   reflected a decline during from levels 
management believes that loan growth should continue as the bank expands its distribution network during  however  the company s main strategy for growth and profitability is expected to come largely from the commercial loan sector

these guidelines include loan review and early identification of problem loans to provide effective loan portfolio administration 
the credit policies and procedures are meant to minimize the risk and uncertainties inherent in lending 
in following these policies and procedures  the bank must rely on estimates  appraisals and evaluation of loans and the possibility that changes could occur because of changing economic conditions 
identified problem loans  which exhibit characteristics financial or otherwise that could cause the loans to become nonperforming or require restructuring in the future  are included on an internal watchlist 
senior management reviews this list regularly and adjusts for changing conditions 
at december   there were  of potential problem loans outstanding classified on the watchlist 
nonperforming loans at december  were  including  of loans placed on nonaccrual status and categorized as impaired and of loans past due days and still accruing which are not categorized as impaired 
total impaired loans are  which includes all nonaccrual loans plus commercial loans impaired of that are still accruing but restructured 
gross interest for for nonaccrual loans would have been interest actually received on nonaccrual loans was resulting in lost interest to date of nonperforming loans at december  were  including of loans placed on nonaccrual status and categorized as impaired and of loans past due days and still accruing which are not categorized as impaired 
gross interest for for nonaccrual loans would have been at december  there were in nonperforming loans consisting of in nonaccrual and in loans accruing but more than days past due 
there were no nonaccrual or impaired loans or any loans past due days or more at december  or there were no foreign loans outstanding at the end of each of the last five years 
during  the bank experienced  in net charged off loans compared to of net charge offs in and in there were no charge offs during or while the level of net charge offs represents a significant increase over prior years  the results partially represent a normal aging of the loan portfolio and reflect the general effects of the sluggish economy on businesses 
the ratio of net charge offs to total average loans was 
of the loans charged off during  was attributable to the unauthorized mortgage activity loss and was attributable to one commercial credit  which was identified during the year and restructured at year end 
in each quarter  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted by management to the amount management believes is necessary to maintain the allowance at adequate levels 
management will allocate specific portions of the allowance for loan losses based on specifically identifiable problem loans 
management s evaluation of the allowance is further based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  industry concentrations within the portfolio and general economic conditions 
management believes that the present allowance is adequate  based on the broad range of considerations listed above  and absent some of those factors  based upon peer industry data of comparable banks

management has a reporting system that monitors past due loans and has adopted policies to pursue its creditor s rights in order to preserve the bank s position 
the primary risk elements with respect to commercial loans are the financial condition of the borrower  the sufficiency of collateral  and lack of timely payment 
management has a policy of requesting and reviewing periodic financial statements from its commercial loan customers  and periodically reviews the sufficiency of collateral and its value 
although management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb losses that are incurred  there can be no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance 
additionally  banking regulators can require an increase to the allowance for loan losses if they deem necessary to satisfy regulatory safety and soundness concerns 
additional provisions for the allowance are expected during as a result of anticipated increases in the total loan portfolio 
the company experienced  of charge offs and of recoveries during the company experienced of charge offs and of recoveries during prior to  the company only experienced an aggregate amount of in loan charge offs during its first three years of operations

during and  the portfolio was used mainly for liquidity as these assets were held in short term discount notes 
during  the company again expanded the size of and the length of maturity of the portfolio as it began to develop a more diversified portfolio 
the portfolio will continue to include some short term liquid holdings from time to time as loan demand remains strong and more liquidity is needed 
since the inception of the company  all securities have been designated as available for sale as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
securities designated as available for sale are stated at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of income tax  reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
a net unrealized gain on this portfolio was recorded at december  in the amount of compared to a net unrealized gain in the amount of at december  and a net unrealized loss of at december  there were no interest bearing deposits with other banks at december  or december  compared to  in interest bearing deposits with other banks at december  the table above presents the total securities portfolio as of december   and during the first quarter of  the company sold  of available for sale agency securities and recorded a gain from the sale 
federal funds sold  consisting of excess funds sold overnight to correspondent banks  and short term investments and interest bearing deposits  consisting of certificates of deposit with maturities less than days and interest bearing accounts at correspondent banks  are used to manage daily liquidity needs and interest rate sensitivity 
together  these short term assets  which recorded a decline of  during  were  and  at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  these short term assets were approximately and of earning assets  respectively 
the decline in short term assets during was reflected mainly as an increase in securities available for sale as the company modestly extended asset maturity 
the balance of short term assets and the balance as a percent of earning assets are expected to fluctuate as the company s balance sheet experiences continued growth 
source of funds the bank s major source of funds is from core deposits of local businesses  governmental and municipal public fund entities  and consumers within the market area 
the bank also generates certificates of deposits through national out of market sources outside allen and surrounding counties developed during and the bank began taking deposits when it commenced operations in february and has experienced significant growth each year 
the out of market deposits are generated by direct negotiation with out of market banks and credit unions  posting on a national bulletin board via the internet to a member customer base  and through negotiated transaction with brokers

the most significant increase from was in both categories of certificates of deposit 
cds under grew by  from year end levels and cds and over increased by  the balance of money market accounts at december  was  compared to  at december   a decrease of while total interest bearing deposits increased  from  mainly a result of new accounts established in the business and consumer sectors  the shift in interest bearing deposits from money markets to cds was reflective of the low interest rate environment as customers from all segments sought better returns 
the total of interest bearing deposits at december  reflected  in business accounts   in consumer accounts and  in public fund accounts compared to   and  respectively  at december  as of december   the company had  in certificates of deposit of or more  of which  mature within three months   mature over three months through six months   mature over six months through twelve months  and  mature over twelve months 
short term borrowings at december  were  unchanged from december   and were entirely comprised of overnight federal funds purchased from one correspondent bank 
in addition to federal funds purchased  the company also had borrowings in the amount of  in federal home loan bank fhlb callable and bullet advances at december  compared to  at december  the increase of  in fhlb borrowings from the levels was a result of the company s efforts to diversify its funding base and desire to lock in funding costs 
the fhlb bullet advances mature in various years from march to december there was  in fhlb callable advances outstanding at december  the callable advances mature in  and each contains a quarterly call feature 
the company had  aggregate principal amount in junior subordinated debenture outstanding at december  and as a result of the company  through its subsidiary  tct  closing a private placement offering of  in trust preferred securities on november  the proceeds of the offering were loaned to the company in exchange for junior subordinated debentures with similar terms to the trust preferred securities 
these securities are considered tier i capital with certain limitations applicable under current regulatory guidelines 
the junior subordinated debentures are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the trust preferred securities at maturity or their earlier redemption at the par amount 
the maturity date of the trust preferred securities is november  subject to the company having received prior approval of the federal reserve bank  if then required  the trust preferred securities are redeemable prior to the maturity date beginning november  and each year thereafter at the option of the company 
stockholders equity was  at december  and  at december  the increase of  was mainly attributable to net income of  and from the net exercise of stock options 
the only other item affecting stockholders equity was a change in net unrealized appreciation on securities available for sale  net of tax 
the company issued  shares of common stock in conjunction with its rights offering and limited public offering during  providing net proceeds of  after deducting marketing agent fees and offering expenses 
at the completion of the ipo during  the company had issued  shares of common stock 
the net proceeds from the sale of the stock in the ipo was  after deducting offering expenses and underwriters discounts and was recorded as common stock and paid in capital 
no additional shares were issued during or at december   the company had a balance of  in retained earnings while at december  the balance was  an increase of  from due to net income generated during see results of operations 
results of operations summary 
the company reported net income of  or 
per diluted share  for the year ended december  this reflects an increase in net income from the  in and net income of  posted during  however net income per diluted share reflects a decrease from the 
reported in and a 
increase from the 
posted in per share earnings were diluted compared to prior years as a result of a increase in average outstanding shares 
the increase in shares was mainly from the rights offering and limited public offering completed august the results reflected a growth in net income compared to despite recording approximately  of pretax expenses for loan losses and administrative costs during from previously disclosed unauthorized mortgage activity 
the improvement in net income over was mainly the result of substantial revenue growth 
net interest income in was  compared to  in  an increase of  due mainly from an increase in loans outstanding 
noninterest income in was  compared to  in  an increase of from further development of the trust business and other fee income based products including mortgage broker fees as well as from gains on the sale of securities 
offsetting the improvements in revenue during was a increase from in the provision for loan losses and a  increase in noninterest expenses related mainly to infrastructure growth costs for compensation  occupancy and equipment 
approximately one fourth of the noninterest expense increase over was related to costs associated with unauthorized mortgage activity 
loan loss provisions are made in the period loans are recorded and are immediate reductions to earnings 
loan loss provisions are expected to continue to reduce earnings as was the case during and prior years  although more moderately  if the anticipated rate of loan growth slows relative to the size of the bank s loan portfolio 
although continued asset growth is anticipated  resulting in increased loan loss provisions  management believes the overall earnings performance of the company will improve 
the asset growth of the company is expected to result in an increased level of net interest income  which  coupled with noninterest income  is expected to exceed the growth and level of noninterest expense and provision for loan losses 
the following table shows some of the key equity performance ratios for the years ended december   and performance ratios return on average total assets return on average equity average equity to average assets net interest income

interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  totaled  and  respectively  providing for net interest income of  the substantial increase of  in net interest income in from and the increase over net interest income from were primarily attributable to an increase in the loans outstanding 
the net yield on average earning assets during was compared to for and for the decline in margin during  and was attributable each year to net interest spread compression caused by the decline in general interest rates and its effects on the company s mostly variable rate mix of loans 
management anticipates that margins will improve due to the company s current asset sensitive balance sheet  assuming interest rates increase 
the level of net interest income is primarily a function of asset size  as the weighted average interest rate received on earning assets is greater than the weighted average interest cost of funding sources  however  factors such as types of assets and liabilities  interest rate risk  liquidity  and customer behavior also impact net interest income as well as the net yield

with significant loan growth in all reported years  the provision for loan losses was  for   for and  for this reflects a  or  increase from to the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding was  and at december    and  respectively 
the company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level management feels is adequate to absorb losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
the evaluation is based upon the company s and the banking industry s historical loan loss experience  known and inherent risks contained in the loan portfolio  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions and other factors 
although the bank experienced loan losses during  it does not yet have enough history of loss activity to only use its own loss experience to establish the allowance for loan losses  therefore  in addition to considering the company s loss history  management has established the provision and allowance for loan losses in consideration of the loss experience of peer financial institutions with similar heavy concentrations in commercial lending and in consideration of general trends in the economy 
the company had  of nonperforming loans at december   an increase of  from the of nonperforming loans at december  the company reported  of net charge offs  or 
of average loans during compared to in net charge offs or 
of average loans during while the charge off results for reported increases over the level  of the charge offs was related to the unauthorized mortgage activity previously disclosed 
noninterest income 
noninterest income recorded substantial growth during as all major categories reflected improved performance 
total noninterest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fees from trust services grew resulting from an increasing base of accounts and assets under management and was  for compared to  for and in in addition to trust income  the mortgage origination unit improved its results during  attributable to a lower interest rates and the refinancing business  however with industry trends  the mortgage originations moderated during the fourth quarter 
mortgage broker fees were during  an increase of or from for mortgage broker fees were for other improvements during included a or increase in deposit service charges  and a or increase in other fee income 
service charge income increased due to an overall expanded account base  a higher level of fees generated on business accounts and increased activity from nsf od charges 
other fee income increased mainly as a result of income generated from bank owned life insurance boli 
in addition to the above  noninterest income results included in gains on the sale of securities available for sale compared to gains on the sale of securities and loans totaling  during there were no gains or losses on the sale of assets during noninterest expense 
noninterest expense totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  or over the increase in expenses is mainly attributable to the infrastructure growth of the company 
this is evidenced by salary and benefit costs  which increased  or  and occupancy and equipment costs which increased  or  over their respective levels 
salary and benefits costs were  or of total expenses for  while occupancy and equipment costs were  or of total expenses 
loan and professional costs increased during from prior year levels by or as the company mainly incurred administrative costs related to the unauthorized mortgage issue and nonrecurring upfront consulting costs for future loan and fee origination 
other various expense categories increased during  such as marketing  data processing  office supplies and postage  and courier services  but to a lesser dollar amount than those mentioned above 
other expense was  for   for and a for  which reflected an  or  increase in and  or increase in  as compared to the prior year 
other expense for both and included losses recorded for the unauthorized mortgage activity in the amount of and  respectively 
during  salaries and benefits costs were  while occupancy and equipment expenses totaled  additional large overhead expenses in included costs for loan and professional fees and services  which amounted to  and marketing expenses were significant noninterest expenses during were  for salary and benefit costs  for occupancy and equipment costs  and for loan and professional costs 
monitoring and controlling overhead expenses while providing high quality service to customers is of the utmost importance to the company 
the efficiency ratio  computed by dividing noninterest expense by net interest income plus noninterest income  was in compared to in and in the overall level of efficiency ratio continues to be high  but reflects expected infrastructure costs associated with growth 
as anticipated  this improvement in efficiency ratio is dependent upon the growth in earning assets along with the development of fee based products and the resulting increases in revenue 
management expects that as additional asset growth and operating efficiencies are realized  the company will earn more on the larger base of earning assets while operating costs will increase at a lesser rate  resulting in an improved efficiency ratio 
income taxes expense 
during  and  the company recorded   and respectively  in income taxes expense 
the effective tax rate recorded for was as compared to for and for the effective tax rate decreased from the prior years as the company grew its tax exempt security portfolio in and and purchased bank owned life insurance boli during capital sources stockholders equity is a noninterest bearing source of funds  which provides support for asset growth

during the company completed a rights offering and limited public offering of its common stock  which increased capital net of costs by  the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet the various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
as a condition to regulatory approvals for the formation of the bank  the company was required to have capitalization sufficient to provide a ratio of tier capital to total assets of not less than eight percent and tier capital to average assets in excess of nine percent  during the first three years of operation 
these restrictions expired in february currently  and going forward  both the company and the bank are now subject to the same capitalization requirements as other financial holding companies and banks 
since the bank began operations  both the company and the bank have been categorized as well capitalized  the highest classification contained within the banking regulations 
the capital ratios of the company and the bank as of december  and are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the ability of the company to pay cash and stock dividends is subject to limitations under various laws and regulations and to prudent and sound banking practices 
no cash or stock dividends were paid in  or the company expects that its future earnings and those of the bank  if any  would be retained to finance future growth and operations 
the company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future 
december liquidity and capital ratios loan to deposit ratio loan to funding ratio total risk based capital tier risk based capital tier leverage capital liquidity liquidity is measured by the company s ability to raise funds through deposits  borrowed funds  capital or cash flow from the repayment of loans and investment securities 
these funds are used to meet depositor withdrawals  maintain reserve requirements  fund loans and operate the company 
liquidity is primarily achieved through the growth of deposits and liquid assets such as securities available for sale  matured securities  and federal funds sold 
asset and liability management is the process of managing the balance sheet to achieve a mix of earning assets and liabilities that maximize profitability  while providing adequate liquidity 
the company s liquidity strategy is to fund growth with deposits from both in market and out of market sources  fhlb borrowings and to maintain an adequate level of short term and medium term investments to meet typical daily loan and deposit activity needs 
deposit growth was substantial during and the company mainly generated deposits from in market sources  however  it expanded its funding base during to include national  non brokered certificates of deposit  borrowings from the fhlb and trust preferred securities 
during the company further expanded its funding base to include brokered deposits 
at december   the balance of non brokered national market cds  brokered cds  and fhlb borrowings were   and  respectively  as compared to  and  respectively  at december  at december  and  total deposits were  and  respectively  and the loan to deposit ratio was and  respectively 
the company expects to continue to experience loan growth 
funding for the loan growth will continue to come from in market sources through the marketing of products and the development of branch locations 
the company will also continue to develop wholesale and out of market deposits and borrowing capacities and use them to augment its interest rate sensitivity strategy and liquidity capabilities and to diversify the funding base of the bank 
the company has the ability to borrow money on a daily basis through correspondent banks federal funds purchased  and at december  had  outstanding  unchanged from the december  balance 
additional capacity to borrow overnight in the form of unused lines of commitment from correspondent banks totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
this type of funding is viewed by the company as only a secondary and temporary source of funds 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet risk in addition to normal loan funding and deposit flow  the company also needs to maintain liquidity to meet the demands of certain unfunded loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit 
the bank maintains off balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
loan commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer at any time  as the customer s needs vary  as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we monitor fluctuations in loan balances and commitment levels and include such data in our overall liquidity management 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized  if any  in the balance sheet 
the bank s maximum exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the face amount of these instruments 
commitments to extend credit are recorded when they are funded and standby letters of credit are recorded at fair value 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
collateral  such as accounts receivable  securities  inventory  property and equipment is generally required based on management s credit assessment of the borrower 
fair value of the bank s off balance sheet instruments commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is based on rates currently charged to enter into similar agreements  taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties credit standing 
at december   the rates on existing off balance sheet instruments were equivalent to current market rates  considering the underlying credit standing of the counterparties 
the company and the bank occupy their respective headquarters  offices and other facilities under long term operating leases and  in addition  are parties to long term contracts for data processing and operating systems 
under the terms of certain employment contracts  upon the occurrence of certain events resulting in the severance of certain executive officers employment with the company  payments may be required to be made in excess of amounts that have been accrued

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk analysis the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
all of the company s transactions are denominated in us dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure 
the company has no agricultural related loan assets and therefore has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices 
any impact that changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices would have on interest rates is assumed to be insignificant 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
the company derives its income primarily from the excess of interest collected on its interest earning assets over the interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
the rates of interest the company earns on its assets and owes on its liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  the company is exposed to lower profitability if it cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
accepting interest rate risk can be an important source of profitability and stockholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk could pose a significant threat to the company s earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to the company s safety and soundness 
evaluating the exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process used to control interest rate risk and the quantitative level of exposure 
the company s interest rate risk management process seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
in evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk  the company assesses the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on its financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity and overall asset quality 
there are two interest rate risk measurement techniques which may be used by the company 
the first  which is commonly referred to as gap analysis  measures the difference between the dollar amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced or repriced during a given time period 
a significant repricing gap could result in a negative impact to the company s net interest margin during periods of changing market interest rates 
the following table depicts the company s gap position as of december  rate sensitivity analysis within three to one to after three twelve five five in thousands months months years years total assets federal funds sold  short term investments and interest earning deposits   securities available for sale      fhlbi and frb stock   fixed rate loans      variable rate loans   allowance for loan losses  other assets  total assets      liabilities interest bearing checking   savings accounts   money market accounts   time deposits      time deposits  and over     short term borrowings   fhlb advances      junior subordinated debt   noninterest bearing checking  other liabilities  total liabilities      stockholders equity  total sources of funds      net asset liability gap     cumulative gap     percent of cumulative gap to total assets a second interest rate risk measurement used is commonly referred to as net interest income simulation analysis 
a simulation model assesses the direction and magnitude of variations in net interest income resulting from potential changes in market interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on various loan and investment assets  cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  and changes in market conditions impacting loan and deposit volume and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment  therefore  a model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or exactly predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and the company s strategies  among other factors 
as growth has dictated  the company began utilizing simulation analysis as a tool for measuring the effects of interest rate risk on the income statement at the end of in addition to changes in interest rates  the level of future net interest income is also dependent on a number of other variables  including the growth  composition and absolute levels of loans  deposits  and other earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  economic and competitive conditions  potential changes in lending  investing  and deposit gathering strategies  client preferences  and other factors 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are rate sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  it does not provide when these items may actually reprice 
for loans receivable  securities  and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities as well as the company s historical experience of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities 
for core deposits demand deposits  interest bearing checking  savings  and money market deposits that have no contractual maturity  the table presents principal cash flows and  as applicable related weighted average interest rates based upon the company s historical experience  and management s judgment as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
the current historical interest rates for core deposits have been assumed to apply for future periods in this table as the actual interest rates that will need to be paid to maintain these deposits are not currently known 
weighted average variable rates are based upon contractual rates existing at the report date 
there is only the table because this is the first year it is required
