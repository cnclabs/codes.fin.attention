item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview american dental partners  inc adpi is a leading provider of business services to multi disciplinary dental groups in selected markets throughout the united states 
we are committed to the growth and success of our affiliated dental groups  and we make substantial investments to support each affiliated dental group s growth 
we assist our affiliates with organizational planning and development  recruiting  retention and training programs  quality assurance initiatives  facilities development and management  employee benefits administration  procurement  information systems  marketing and payor relations  and financial planning  reporting and analysis 
at december   we were affiliated with dental groups  comprising dentists practicing in locations in states 
affiliation and acquisition summary when affiliating with a dental group  we acquire selected assets and enter into a long term service agreement with the affiliated dental group practice or professional corporation pc 
under our service agreements  we are responsible for providing all services necessary for the administration of the non clinical aspects of the dental operations 
the pc is responsible for the provision of dental care 
each of our service agreements is for an initial term of years 
during  and  we completed seven  four and three transactions in which we acquired non clinical dental assets  respectively  and simultaneously entered into year service agreements in two of these transactions the assets of twelve of the transactions were combined with existing affiliated dental group practices 
in total  these fourteen affiliations resulted in the addition of dental facilities and operatories 
in addition during  we acquired the outstanding stock of a dental laboratory and selected assets of a second laboratory 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on acquisitions and affiliations 
we are constantly evaluating potential affiliations with dental groups and acquisition of companies that would expand our business capabilities 
the number of new affiliations and acquisitions over the next twelve months could be at levels greater or less than we have achieved during each of the past two years 
affiliate adjusted gross revenue  net revenue and total revenue affiliate adjusted gross revenue and payor mix we do not own or control the affiliated dental group practices and  accordingly  do not consolidate the financial statements of the pcs with ours 
our affiliated dental group practices generate revenue from patients and dental benefit providers under fee for service  ppo and capitated managed care plans 
the affiliated dental group practices record revenue at established rates reduced by contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts to arrive at adjusted gross revenue 
contractual adjustments represent the difference between gross billable charges at established rates and the portion of those charges reimbursed pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts 
while payor mix varies from market to market  the following table provides the aggregate payor mix percentages of our affiliated dental group practices for the years ended december fee for service ppo plans capitated managed care plans faced with strong patient demand and tight labor markets  several of our affiliated dental group practices have been realigning their reimbursement mix away from capitated managed care plans that carry significant discounts 
concurrently  the dental industry is witnessing growth in ppo plans 
we anticipate that our affiliated dental group practices will continue to witness growth in ppo plans and potentially a reduction in capitated 
table of contents managed care plans 
this change in reimbursement mix has largely been accomplished with the cooperation of the dental benefit provider community in general 
there can be no assurance  however  that the shift in reimbursement mix will not result in the termination of certain third party payor contracts 
the affiliated dental group practices reimburse us for expenses incurred on their behalf in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities and pay fees to us for business services 
expenses incurred for the operation and administration of the dental facilities include salaries and benefits for non dentist personnel working at the dental facilities the administrative staff and  where permitted by law  the dental assistants and hygienists  lab fees  dental supplies  office occupancy costs of the dental facilities  depreciation related to the fixed assets at the dental facilities and other expenses such as professional fees  marketing costs and general and administrative expenses

after reimbursement of expenses and payment of all service fees to us  the amounts retained by the affiliated dental group practices is used to compensate dentists and in certain states where the affiliated dental group practices must employ dental hygienists and or dental assistants  compensate such non dentist employees

under certain service agreements  our service fee consists of a variable monthly fee which is based upon a specified percentage of the amount by which the affiliated dental group practice s adjusted gross revenue exceeds expenses incurred in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities 
under certain service agreements  our service fees consist of a fixed monthly fee and an additional variable fee 
to the extent that there is operating income after payment of the fixed monthly fee  reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with the operation and administration 
table of contents of the dental facilities and payment of provider expenses  an additional variable fee is paid to us 
under certain service agreements  our service fee consists entirely of a fixed monthly fee 
the fixed monthly fees are determined by agreement of us and the affiliated dental group practice in a formal budgeting process 
in all instances  the service fee is negotiated as fair market value for services and capital provided by us to our affiliated dental group practices 
as part of our objective of being the leading provider of services to dental group practices  we are continually expanding our resources and capabilities  including vertical integration of ancillary dental activities 
we work with and receive fees from dental benefit providers on behalf of our affiliates to arrange programs for the provision of care to their patients 
in  we acquired two dental laboratories to expand our procurement capabilities 
although both activities earn revenue from dental practices not affiliated with us  we expect that the growth of both of these activities will come primarily from the growth of our affiliated dental groups 
for additional information on components of our net revenue  see note of notes of consolidated financial statements 
total revenue although we do not own or control our affiliated dental group practices  we believe that it is more meaningful to analyze our revenue  expenses and margins in terms of total revenue  including the adjusted gross revenue of our affiliated dental group practices 
total revenue and adjusted gross revenue are not measures of financial performance under gaap  but our expenses and business services fees are incurred or earned in support of the adjusted gross revenue of our affiliated dental group practices 
we use these and other non gaap financial measures to analyze operating trends and to help manage our business

table of contents results of operations total revenue unaudited total revenue increased from  in to  in and to  in the increase in was primarily the result of new affiliations and the acquisition of dental laboratories offset by the disruption of business associated with the managed care contract terminations in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the managed care contract terminations

the increases in amounts retained by affiliated dental group practices as a percentage of adjusted gross revenue is mainly attributable to entering into affiliations where dental hygienists and dental assistants are employed by the affiliated dental group practices 
additionally  in  there was an increase in health and workers compensation insurance costs of  representing a increase over the prior year 
also due to the growth in demand for dental services exceeding the growth in the supply of dentists nationally in recent years  dentist compensation has been increasing generally and for our affiliated dental groups specifically 
we expect this trend to moderate 
net revenue net revenue increased from  in to  in and to  in the increase in net revenue in was attributable to the current year impact of entering into service agreements in connection with affiliation transactions and revenues generated from two dental laboratories acquired during the year 
during  of the increase was mainly attributable to the current year impact of entering into service agreements in connection with affiliation transactions during and with of the increase attributable to same market net revenue growth 

table of contents net revenue derived from our service agreement with park dental represented approximately  and of our consolidated net revenue for  and  respectively 
effective july   our affiliated dental group practices in wisconsin merged into one affiliated dental group practice  thereby resulting in our net revenue from its service agreement becoming greater than of our consolidated net revenue 
net revenue from our service agreement with the merged wisconsin dental group represented approximately  and of our consolidated net revenue for  and  respectively 
no other service agreement or customers related to other revenue accounted for greater than of consolidated net revenue 
salaries and benefits salaries and benefits expense includes costs for personnel working for us at the dental facilities  dental laboratory and regional management 
at the facility level  we generally employ the administrative staff and  where permitted by state law  the dental hygienists and dental assistants 
the local and regional operating management teams supervise and support the staff at the dental facilities 
salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased from in to in and in the decrease in was primarily related to the reduction in staff and administrative positions at two affiliates as a result of managed contract terminations during see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  partially offset by wage inflation and the addition of two dental laboratories where salaries and benefits are generally a higher percentage of total revenue 
the decrease in was attributable to entering into affiliations during and where the affiliated dental group practices were required to employ the dental hygienists and dental assistants  thereby lowering our salaries and benefits expense in relation to net revenue earned 
additionally our net revenue growth was greater than our employee growth  contributing to the decrease as a percentage of total revenue 
these increases were partially offset by the addition of two dental laboratories where salaries and benefits are generally a higher percentage of revenue and an increase in health insurance costs of  representing a increase over lab fees and dental supplies lab fees and dental supplies expense varies from affiliate to affiliate and is affected by the volume and type of procedures performed 
lab fees and dental supplies expense as a percentage of total revenue was in  in and in the increase in was due to price increases from certain lab and supply manufactures along with a change in mix of the type of procedures performed 
the decrease as a percentage of total revenue in was primarily attributable a new pricing arrangement negotiated with our primary dental supply vendor as well as continued efforts to manage these expenses 
we are continuing our efforts to offset dental supply manufacturer price increases with the economies of scale through our national dental supply purchasing and rebate programs 
office occupancy office occupancy expense includes rent expense and certain other operating costs such as utilities associated with dental facilities  dental laboratory and the local and regional administrative offices 
such costs vary based on the size of each facility and the market rental rate for dental office space in each particular geographic market 
office occupancy expense as a percentage of total revenue was in  in and in the increase in was primarily as a result of the investment in the relocation and addition of new dental facilities and a decrease in facility utilization as a result of the managed care contract terminations in the decrease as a percentage of adjusted gross revenue in was primarily attributable to higher utilization of our dental facilities as evidenced by a higher level of total revenue per facility as compared to in  we added three new dental facilities and relocated and or expanded nine facilities 
in  we added one new facility and relocated and or expanded ten facilities 
in  we relocated and or expanded sixteen facilities 

table of contents other operating expenses other operating expenses include non health related insurance expense  professional fees  marketing costs and other general and administrative expenses 
other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue were in  in and in the increase in was primarily due to the impact of the lost revenue associated with the managed care contract terminations in  partially offset by  of unusual expenses in related to costs associated with increased patient communications  deinstallation of certain computer equipment and the relocation of certain resource center personnel associated with the managed care contract terminations 
other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue in stayed consistent with due to effort to manage these expenses  offset by increased insurance costs of  representing a increase over general corporate expenses general corporate expenses consist of compensation expenses for our corporate personnel and administrative staff  as well as facility and other administrative costs of our corporate office 
general corporate expenses as a percentage of total revenue were in  in and in general corporate expenses in included  of unusual expenses associated with the restructuring of management 
these costs included separation and relocation of certain management personnel following the managed care contract terminations in the increase in was mainly due to our management incentive compensation plan  the addition of new management positions and increased benefit costs 
we believe general corporate expenses may increase in at a rate greater than total revenue as we continue to expand our management infrastructure  to incur professional fees to comply with new corporate governance regulations and to begin the implementation of improvis in late depreciation depreciation expense includes charges related to leasehold improvements and furniture  fixtures and equipment used to operate the dental facilities  lab facilities  local and regional management offices and our corporate office 
depreciation expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased from in to in and in the decrease in depreciation expense as a percentage of total revenue in was primarily due to some of our assets becoming fully depreciated during the year  partially offset by additional depreciation expense from the addition and relocation and or expansion of dental facilities during the decrease in depreciation expense as a percentage of total revenue in was primarily due to higher utilization of our dental facilities as evidenced by a higher level of adjusted gross revenue per facility over we expect to continue to invest in the development of new dental facilities and the relocation and or expansion of existing dental facilities in accordingly  depending on the amount and timing of such future capital expenditures  depreciation may increase in at a rate greater than total revenue 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets amortization as a percentage of total revenue decreased from in to in and in as a percentage of total revenue  the decrease is due to the number of affiliations and acquisitions in recent periods being less than the average since our founding as well as the impact of not amortizing goodwill in and management continually evaluates the appropriateness of the useful lives of its intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets could increase in the future as a result of definite lived intangibles recorded in connection with future affiliations and acquisitions 
special charges special charges represent a provision for costs associated with reductions in physical capacity at associated dental care providers and patient communications at associated dental care providers and park dental as a result of the managed care contract terminations in these costs include facility closure and lease exit costs of three dental offices in phoenix and regional resource centers  employee termination costs  patient communication and other expenses 

table of contents interest expense  net net interest expense decreased from  in to  in and  in the decreases in and were due to a lower overall interest rate and a lower average debt balance compared to the prior year 
net interest expense in was partially offset by the expensing of  of unamortized debt issuance costs as part of terminating our existing credit facility and entering into a new credit facility 
see the liquidity and capital resources section for more information related to our credit facility 
income taxes our effective tax rate was approximately for  in and in the effective tax rate in decreased from the rate primarily due to fluctuations in taxable income in various states in which we operate and the elimination of certain permanent differences between the financial statement and tax treatment of goodwill amortization 
the increase in our effective tax rate for was mainly a result of recording additional expenses related to adjustments from prior periods 
we anticipate that the effective tax rate for to be in a range of to 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operating and capital needs  including cash used for acquisitions and affiliations  capital expenditures and working capital  from sales of equity securities  borrowings under our revolving line of credit and cash generated from operations 
from january  through december   we completed dental practice affiliations and acquired the outstanding stock of one dental laboratory and selected assets of a second dental laboratory for aggregate consideration of  in cash   in subordinated promissory notes   in deferred payments and a future contingent payment for two affiliations based on a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes in excess of a predetermined threshold for the twelve months ending april  and december   respectively 
we estimate that future contingent payments could be between  and  in future years  such contingent payments could result in additional annual amortization expense of approximately  to  for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operating activities amounted to  and  respectively 
in  cash from operations primarily resulted from increased net earnings after adding back non cash items and a decrease in receivables due from affiliated dental group practices  partially offset by payments of special charges of  the decrease of receivables due from affiliated dental group practices  which totaled  was due to stability in payor mix from the prior year and a reduction in patient receivables at our affiliated dental group practices as a result of increased focus on receivables management 
the days sales outstanding for the patient receivables of our affiliated dental group practices decreased from days at december  to days at december  in  cash from operations primarily resulted from net earnings after adding back non cash items  a decrease in receivables due from affiliated dental group practices and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued compensation 
the decrease in receivables due from affiliated dental group practices  which totaled  was due to better working capital management and continued focus on receivables management at our affiliated dental group practices 
the days sales outstanding for the patient receivables of our affiliated dental group practices decreased from days at december  to days at december  we do not expect the days sales outstanding of our affiliated dental group practices to decrease in future years to a similar extent as the improvement achieved during the past two years

we have a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission registration no 
covering a total of  shares of common stock and  aggregate principal amount of subordinated promissory notes to be issued in connection with future dental practice affiliations and acquisitions 
as of december    shares and  of notes remain available for issuance under this shelf registration statement 

table of contents our growth to date has resulted in large measure from our ability to affiliate with additional dental practices 
historically  we have used a combination of cash  subordinated debt and common stock as consideration for past affiliations and acquisitions and plan to use these sources in the future 
in recent years  the consideration paid has consisted of cash and subordinated debt 
in the event that our common stock does not maintain sufficient valuation or if potential affiliation or acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept our securities as consideration  we will continue to use cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility for future affiliations and acquisitions 
in addition  if sufficient financing is not available as needed on terms acceptable to us  our affiliation and acquisition strategy will be modified 
we are constantly evaluating potential affiliations with dental groups and acquisition of companies that would expand our business capabilities 
the number of new affiliations and acquisitions over the next twelve months could be at levels greater than we have achieved during each of the past two years 
we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under our current revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  affiliations and acquisitions for at least the next twelve months 
any excess cash will be used to reduce indebtedness or to repurchase common stock through our previously announced repurchase program  pursuant to which approximately  remains available to repurchase additional shares

on an on going basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the carrying value of receivables due from affiliated dental group practices  goodwill and other intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
valuation of receivables due from affiliated dental group practices the company s carrying amount of receivables due from affiliated dental group practices requires management to assess the collectibility of our business fees 
our fees are dependent on the economic viability of 
table of contents the affiliated dental group practices based on actual and expected future financial performance including collectibility of the affiliated dental group practices patient receivables  net of contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts 
the affiliated dental group practices record revenue at established rates reduced by contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts to arrive at adjusted gross revenue 
contractual adjustments represent the difference between gross billable charges at established rates and the portion of those charges reimbursed pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts 
for contracts where there is no defined benefit  contractual adjustments are based upon historical collection experience and other relevant factors 
the affiliated dental group practices provision for doubtful accounts is estimated in the period that services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as necessary 
the estimates for the provision and related allowance are based on an evaluation of historical collection experience  the aging profile of the accounts receivable  write off percentages and other relevant factors 
changes in these factors in future periods could result in increases or decreases in the provision 
in the event that final reimbursement or bad debt experience differs from original estimates  adjustments to the affiliated dental group practices patient receivables would be required which may impact the collectibility of receivables due from affiliated dental group practices 
to date we have not recorded any losses related to our receivables due from affiliated dental group practices 
goodwill and other intangible assets our business acquisitions and affiliations typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we may incur 
the determination of the value of such goodwill and intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
as part of each affiliation and acquisition  we determine the amount of goodwill and intangible assets related to the transaction 
in determining the amount of goodwill or intangible assets we estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in determining fair value  we review the balance sheet of the acquired company to ensure the reasonableness of the balances  including the collectibility of receivables  value of inventory on hand  replacement value and depreciable lives of property and equipment and appropriate level of accrued liabilities 
in determining the amount of intangible assets related to customer relationships as part of an acquisition  we estimate future discounted cash flows based on many factors  including historical and projected revenue streams and operating margins and customer attrition rates 
if the facts and circumstances change indicating that the fair value of tangible net assets or intangible assets should change  future period results could be impacted 
for definite lived intangible assets related to service agreements  we evaluate the amortization period based on the facts and circumstances of each individual affiliation 
our evaluation includes reviewing historical and projected operating results  dental benefit plan provider contracts  customer and patient stability and market presence in the geographic area that we are entering  along with other relevant factors 
the initial amortization period for definite lived intangibles is generally to years 
if circumstances change  indicating a shorter estimated period of benefit  future amortization expense could increase 
management performs an impairment test on goodwill on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we determine impairment by comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting units 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows using a discount reflecting our average cost of funds 
if impairment were determined  we would make the appropriate adjustment to goodwill to reduce the asset s carrying value 

table of contents management performs an impairment test on definite lived intangibles when facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that the intangibles may be impaired  such as loss of key personnel or competition 
we review the undiscounted net cash flows of the asset to the carrying value of the intangible asset and projected revenue streams when performing the impairment test on intangible assets 
if impairment was determined  we would make the appropriate adjustment to the intangible assets to reduce the asset s carrying value to fair value 
to date we have not recorded any impairment charges or write downs of goodwill and intangible assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
with regard to our revolving credit facility  we are also exposed to variable rate interest for the banks applicable margins  ranging from to for libor borrowings based upon our debt coverage ratio 
as a result of entering into a new revolving credit facility in october  the banks margin decreased by from historical levels 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flow 
we do not believe a one percentage point change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair market value of our fixed rate debt 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact for one year based upon the amounts outstanding at december  under our variable rate revolving credit facility for each one percentage point change in interest rates would be approximately  per annum 
we do not presently undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not party to any interest rate risk management transactions
