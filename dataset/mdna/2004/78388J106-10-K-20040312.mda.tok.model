item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a leading independent owner and operator of over  wireless communications towers in the eastern third of the united states 
we generate revenues from our two primary businesses  site leasing and site development 
in our site leasing business  we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own or manage for or lease from others 
the towers that we own have 
table of contents been constructed by us at the request of a carrier  built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired 
in our site development business  we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 
the percentage of revenues derived from the leasing of antenna space at  or on  communication towers continued to increase as a result of our emphasis on our site leasing business through the leasing and management of tower sites 
subsequent to the sale of towers to aat communications corp 
during western tower sale we have focused our leasing activities in the eastern third of the united states where substantially all of our remaining towers are located 
operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future results 
you should be aware of the significant changes in the nature and scope of our business when reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results 
the towers sold in the western tower sale during have been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
additionally  towers located in the western two thirds of the united states that we had previously decided to sell have also been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as of december   of these towers remain as held for sale 
all discussion related to the consolidated statements of operations for the periods discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been adjusted to reflect these towers as discontinued operations 
site leasing services site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies 
revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts 
each site leasing contract relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years  renewable for five five year periods at the option of the tenant 
almost all of our site leasing contracts contain specific rent escalators  which average per year  including the renewal option periods 
site leasing contracts are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease agreements 
rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue 
cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of payments for rental on ground and other underlying property  repairs and maintenance exclusive of employee related costs  utilities  insurance  and property taxes 
for any given tower  such costs are generally unrelated to the number of tenants on such tower 
as such  operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower 
site leasing revenues comprised of total revenues for the year ended december   and of total revenues for the year ended december  site leasing contributed of total gross profit for the year ended december  and of total gross profit for the year ended december  as a result of the western tower sale  we reduced our tower portfolio by towers 
during  to further improve efficiencies in our portfolio  we decided to sell an additional towers remaining in the western two thirds of the united states  which were not part of the western tower sale 
three of these towers were sold during the fourth quarter of  leaving towers held for sale at december  
table of contents gross profit margins on the towers sold in the western tower sale were relatively comparable to the gross profit margins on the towers we retained 
therefore  the sale of these towers is not expected to have a material impact on our site leasing gross profit margin 
we do not anticipate making any other material changes to our tower portfolio in as of december   we owned  towers  substantially all of which are in the eastern third of the united states 
this number excludes the towers held for sale at december  site development services our site development business consists of two segments  site development consulting and site development construction  through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of end to end services 
in the consulting segment of our site development business  we offer clients the following services network pre design  site audits  identification of potential locations for towers and antennas  support in buying or leasing of the location  and assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 
in the construction segment of our site development business  we provide a number of services  including  but not limited to the following tower and related site construction  antenna installation  and radio equipment installation  commissioning and maintenance 
site development revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies or companies providing development or project management services to wireless communications companies 
our site development customers engage us on a project by project basis  and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty 
site development projects  both consulting and construction  include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis 
the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis 
time and materials based site development contracts are billed and revenue is recognized at contractual rates as the services are rendered 
our site development projects generally take from to months to complete 
for those site development consulting contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis  we bill the client  and recognize revenue  based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis 
upon the completion of each phase we recognize the revenue related to that phase 
our revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting  determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract 
this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts 
these amounts are based on estimates  and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion 
revenue from our site development construction business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities  which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients capital expenditures  the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period  weather and other factors 
cost of site development consulting revenue and construction revenue include all costs of materials  salaries and labor  including payroll taxes  subcontract labor  vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects 
all costs related to site development consulting projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred 
our site development revenues and profit margins decreased significantly during and this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in capital expenditures by wireless carriers and vigorous competition  particularly for our site development construction services  which adversely affected our volume of activity and the pricing for our services 

table of contents percentage of revenues for the years ended december  gross profit contribution for the years ended december  site development consulting site development construction critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
in other cases  management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included herein 
note that our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 
construction revenue revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting  determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract 
this method is used because we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on each contract 
these amounts are based on estimates  and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on each contract nears completion 
the asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our allowance is a matter of judgment 
see the consolidated balance sheet 
asset impairment we evaluate the potential impairment of individual long lived assets  principally the tower sites 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers has been impaired  such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site 
we consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment  including but not limited to  general market and economic conditions  historical operating results  geographic location  lease up potential  and expected timing of lease up 
in addition  we make certain assumptions in determining an asset s fair value less costs to sell for purposes of calculating the amount of an impairment 
table of contents charge 
changes in those assumptions or market conditions may result in a fair value less costs to sell which is different from management s estimates 
future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in addition  if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect  a future impairment charge may be required 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
asset retirement obligations effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas under the new accounting principle  we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made and we accrete such liability through the obligation s estimated settlement date 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over its estimated useful life 
significant management estimates and assumptions are required in determining the scope and fair value of our obligations to restore leaseholds to their original condition upon termination of ground leases 
in determining the scope and fair value of our obligations  assumptions were made with respect to the historical retirement experience as an indicator of future restoration probabilities  intent in renewing existing ground leases through lease termination dates  current and future value and timing of estimated restoration costs  and the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount future obligations 
while we feel the assumptions were appropriate  there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from estimates 
we will review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations as our gross profit mix shifts more towards site leasing  operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future results 
you should be aware of the dramatic changes in the nature and scope of our business when reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results 
year ended compared to year ended revenues for the years ended december  percentage of revenues percentage of revenues percentage increase decrease dollars in thousands site leasing site development consulting site development construction total revenues site leasing revenue increased due to the increased number of tenants and the amount of equipment added to our towers

during the year ended  of contractual revenues from new leases and amendments executed in were related to new tenant installation and were related to additional equipment being added by existing tenants 
additionally  we have experienced  on average  higher rents per tenant due to higher rents from new tenants  higher rents upon renewal by existing tenants and additional equipment added by existing tenants 
both site development consulting and construction revenue decreased primarily as a result of the decline in capital expenditures by wireless

by comparison  in we recognized approximately million of asset impairment charges related to towers 
the impairment of operational tower assets resulted primarily from our evaluations of the fair 
table of contents value of our operating tower portfolio through a discounted cash flow analysis 
towers determined to be impaired were primarily towers with no tenants and or with little or deteriorating prospects for future lease up 
in addition  the asset impairment charge included million of goodwill that was recorded during the first two quarters of  which was determined to be impaired during june when the transitional impairment test of goodwill was performed under sfas in february  as a result of the deterioration of capital market conditions for wireless carriers  we reduced our capital expenditures for new tower development and acquisition activities  suspended any new investment for additional towers  reduced our workforce and closed or consolidated offices 
of the million charge recorded during the year ended december   approximately million related to the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in progress and related construction materials on approximately sites 
the remaining million related primarily to the costs of employee separation for approximately employees and exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of approximately offices 
during  in response to a decline in expenditures by wireless service providers  particularly with respect to site development activities  we committed to new plans of restructuring associated with further downsizing activities 
of the million charge recorded for the year ended december   approximately million related to the abandonment of new tower build work in process and trailing costs associated with previously abandoned new tower build work in process

additionally  interest expense in was reduced as a result of our interest rate swap agreement that existed during most of the write off of deferred financing fees and loss on extinguishment of debt is attributable to a write off of million of deferred financing fees associated with the termination of the prior senior credit facility and million associated with the early retirement of a portion of our senior discount notes and our senior notes 
we expect to incur additional material charges in from the write off of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt associated with the senior credit refinancing  the senior note repurchases and the senior discount note repurchases and redemptions which occurred subsequent to december  
table of contents discontinued operations for the years ended december  percentage increase in thousands loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes as previously discussed a total of towers towers sold in the western tower sale and additional towers held for sale meet the criteria for discontinued operations treatment 
the increase in loss from discontinued operations resulted primarily from a loss on sale of million related to the western tower sale 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle for the years ended december  percentage decrease in thousands cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle effective january   we adopted a method of accounting for asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas under the new accounting principle  we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of our tower fixed assets 
the cumulative effect of the change on prior years resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately million that is included in net loss for the year ended december  during  we completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill required under sfas  which was adopted effective january  as a result of completing the required transitional test  we recorded a charge retroactive to the adoption date for the cumulative effect of accounting change in the amount of million representing the excess of the carrying value of certain assets as compared to their estimated fair value 
of the total million cumulative effect adjustment  million related to the site development construction reporting segment and million related to the site leasing reporting segment 
net loss for the years ended december  percentage decrease in thousands net loss this decrease in net loss is primarily a result of lower restructuring and other charges  lower asset impairment charges  and lower amounts resulting from a cumulative effect in change in accounting principle offset by an increase in interest expense and write offs associated with the extinguishment of debt 
we expect to incur additional net losses in year ended compared to year ended revenues for the years ended december  percentage of revenues percentage of revenues percentage increase decrease dollars in thousands site leasing site development consulting site development construction total revenues 
table of contents site leasing revenue increased due to the increased number of tenants added to our towers  higher average rents received and the increase in the number of towers in our portfolio 
as of december  we had  tenants as compared to  tenants at december  site development consulting revenues increased due to several new contracts for site acquisition and zoning services from wireless communications carriers 
site development construction revenue decreased due primarily to reduced carrier activity and price competition resulting from lower capital expenditures by wireless carriers on or around cell sites 
cost of revenues for the years ended december  percentage increase decrease in thousands site leasing site development consulting site development construction total cost of revenues site leasing cost of revenue increased due to the increased number of towers owned resulting in an increased amount of lease payments to site owners and related site costs as well as increases in operating costs of certain sites  maintenance and property taxes

site development construction cost of revenue decreased  due primarily to lower levels of activity 
gross profit for the years ended december  percentage increase decrease in thousands site leasing site development consulting site development construction total gross profit gross profit for the site leasing business increased as a result of the increased number of tenants added to our towers  and to a lesser extent  additional towers added to our portfolio

table of contents the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense primarily resulted from a decrease in tower developmental expenses as well as the reduction of offices  elimination of personnel and elimination of other infrastructure that had previously been necessary to support our prior level of new asset growth but was no longer required as a result of the restructurings previously discussed 
included within selling  general and administrative expenses is a provision for doubtful accounts 
the provision for doubtful accounts increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   reflecting our assessment of a more challenging financial environment for our customers 
during the year ended december  we incurred restructuring charges in the amount of million 
of the million charge  approximately million related to the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in process and related construction materials on approximately sites 
the remaining million of restructuring expense related primarily to the costs of employee separation for approximately employees and exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of approximately offices 
exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of offices primarily represented our estimate of future lease obligations after considering sublease opportunities 
in the first quarter of  certain tower sites held and used in operations were considered to be impaired resulting in a million impairment charge 
towers determined to be impaired were primarily towers with no tenants and little or no prospects for future lease up 
in addition  during the first six months of  we recorded additional goodwill totaling approximately million resulting from the achievement of certain earn out obligations under various construction acquisition agreements entered into prior to july   which was determined to be impaired and written off

table of contents total other expenses increased primarily as a result of a reduction in interest income  increased interest expense  and increased non cash amortization of original issue discount and debt issuance costs 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower cash balances during the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher principal amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility in as compared to and to a full quarter of interest expense on our million senior notes in the first quarter of compared to a partial quarter of interest expense on these senior notes in the first quarter of although the aggregate principal amount of total debt increased from the prior year  the resulting increase in interest expense associated with the higher principal in was offset in part by the interest rate reduction we recognized in connection with our interest rate swap agreement 
the increase in non cash amortization was primarily due to higher accretion on the senior discount notes 
discontinued operations for the years ended december  percentage increase in thousands loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes the increase in loss is primarily attributable to interest expense allocated to discontinued operations in no interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations in as a result of the lower debt balances in as compared to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle for the years ended december  percentage increase in thousands cumulative effect of change in accounting principle during the period ended june   we completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill required under sfas  which was adopted effective january  as a result of completing the required transitional test  we recorded a charge retroactive to the adoption date for the cumulative effect of the accounting change in the amount of million  representing the excess of the carrying value of certain assets as compared to their estimated fair value at january  of the total million cumulative effect adjustment  million related to the site development construction reporting segment and million related to the site leasing reporting segment 
net loss for the years ended december  percentage increase in thousands net loss as a result of the factors discussed above  net loss significantly increased from to liquidity and capital resources sba communications corporation sba communications is a holding company with no business operations of its own 
our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of sba telecommunications  inc telecommunications which is also a holding company that owns the outstanding capital stock of sba senior finance 
sba senior finance owns directly or indirectly  the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
we conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries 

table of contents accordingly  our only source of cash to pay our obligations  other than financings  is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries 
even if we decided to pay a dividend on or make a distribution of the capital stock of our subsidiaries  we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend 
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash or stock dividends is restricted under the terms of our current senior credit facility 
a summary of our cash flows is as follows for the year ended december  in thousands summary cash flow information cash used in operations cash provided by investing activities cash used in financing activities decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  december  cash and cash equivalents  december  sources of liquidity during  we sold sites  representing substantially all of our towers in the western two thirds of the united states  in exchange for gross cash proceeds of approximately million 
as a result of this transaction  we produced cash from investing activities 
the purchase and sale agreement contained a number of provisions providing for adjustments to the purchase price 
we anticipate that the final gross cash proceeds to be realized from the western tower sale  after all potential purchase price adjustments  will be approximately million 
in december  sba communications and telecommunications co issued million of its senior discount notes  which produced net proceeds of approximately million after deducting offering expenses 
proceeds from the senior discount notes were used to tender for approximately million of our senior discount notes and for general working capital purposes 
during january  sba senior finance closed on a new senior credit facility in the amount of million 
this facility consists of a million term loan which was funded at closing  a million delayed draw term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
sba senior finance used the proceeds from the funding of the million term loan under the new senior credit facility to  in part  repay the old credit facility in full  consisting of million outstanding 
in addition to the amounts outstanding  we were required to pay million to the lenders under the old facility to facilitate the assignment of the old facility to the new lenders 
sba senior finance has recorded additional deferred financing fees of approximately million associated with this new facility 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details relating to the financial impact of this refinancing 
in addition to our capital restructuring activities completed in and the first quarter of  in order to manage our significant levels of indebtedness and to ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants  we may explore a number of alternatives  including selling certain assets or lines of business  issuing equity  repurchasing  restructuring or refinancing or exchanging for equity some or all of our debt or pursuing other financial alternatives  and we may from time to time implement one or more of these alternatives 
one or more of the alternatives may include the possibility of issuing additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock or converting our existing indebtedness into shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock  any of which would dilute our existing shareholders 
we cannot assure you that any of these strategies can be consummated  or if consummated  would effectively address the risks associated with our significant level of indebtedness 

table of contents uses of liquidity we used the proceeds from the may credit facility discussed in this report  cash on hand and a portion of the proceeds from the western tower sale to repay in full the prior credit facility  which had million outstanding immediately prior to repayment 
as discussed above  subsequent to december  we used a portion of the proceeds from the january credit facility to repay the may credit facility  to repurchase senior discount notes and senior notes in the open market and to redeem all outstanding senior discount notes on march  as a result primarily of the repayment of million under a prior credit facility  we used million of cash in financing activities 
our cash capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is a result of lower investment in new tower assets 
during  we built new towers as compared to when we built new towers and bought existing towers 
we currently plan to make total cash capital expenditures during of million to million 
due to the relatively young age of our towers and remaining capacity available to accommodate new tenants  it is not necessary for us to spend a significant amount of dollars for capital improvements or modifications to our towers to accommodate new tenants 
we estimate we will incur approximately  per tower per year on these type of capital expenditures 
all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio and to complete pending build to suit obligations 
cash used in operations was million for the year ended december  of this amount million was related to an increase in short term investments and approximately million was related to the reduction in accounts payable 
during  we focused our efforts on improving our outstanding receivables balances 
as a result of these efforts  our accounts receivable balance  after allowances and write offs  was improved by approximately million 
additionally  during approximately million of cash was paid for interest on our various debt instruments 
as a result of our refinancing activities discussed above  our cash interest requirements for are expected to be significantly lower than the requirements in debt service requirements at december  we had million outstanding of our senior notes 
as of the date of this filing we had million outstanding of our senior notes 
the senior notes mature february  interest on these notes is payable february and august of each year 
based on amounts outstanding at the time of this filing  annual debt service requirements are approximately million 
at december  we had million outstanding of our senior discount notes 
the notes accrete in value until december  at which time the notes will have a balance of million 
these notes mature december  interest on these notes is payable june and december beginning june  at december  we had million outstanding of our senior discount notes 
the senior discount notes were originally scheduled to mature on march  these notes were redeemed on march  at the call price of of the aggregate principal amount 
as of december  we had million outstanding under the senior credit facility in existence at that time 
as of march   we had million outstanding under the new senior credit facility 
based on the outstanding amount of million and rates in effect at such time  we estimate our annual debt service including amortization to be approximately million related to our senior credit facility 

table of contents the issuance of our senior discount notes and the new senior credit facility coupled with the retirement of the senior discount notes  open market purchases and exchanges of our senior notes and the repayment of our prior senior credit facility will result in a cash savings of approximately million in debt service and amortization payments in capital instruments senior notes and senior discount notes the senior notes were issued by sba communications  are unsecured and are pari passu in right of payment with our other existing and future senior indebtedness 
the senior discount notes were co issued by sba communications and telecommunications in december  are unsecured  rank pari passu with the senior indebtedness and are structurally senior to all indebtedness of sba communications 
both  the senior notes and the senior discount notes place certain restrictions on  among other things  the incurrence of debt and liens  issuance of preferred stock  payment of dividends or other distributions  sale of assets  transactions with affiliates  sale and leaseback transactions  certain investments and our ability to merge or consolidate with other entities

in november   in connection with the offering of our senior discount notes and our tender offer for of our outstanding senior discount notes  sba senior finance  a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of telecommunications  assumed all rights and obligations of telecommunications under the senior credit facility pursuant to an amended and restated credit agreement with the senior credit lenders 
telecommunications was released from any obligation to repay the indebtedness under the senior credit facility 
simultaneously with this assumption  telecommunications contributed substantially all of its assets  consisting primarily of stock in our various operating subsidiaries  to sba senior finance 
sba senior finance refinanced this credit facility in january and used the proceeds from the new facility to repay this facility in full 
this prior senior credit facility  as amended  provided for million in term loans and million in revolving lines of credit  which could be borrowed  repaid and redrawn and which would have converted to a term loan january  amortization of amounts borrowed under this facility was to commence in  at an annual rate of in and in each of  and all remaining amounts were to be due and payable at maturity on december  amounts borrowed under this facility accrued interest at base rate  as defined in the agreement plus basis points or the euro dollar rate plus basis points 
additional interest of per annum also accrued  but was not due to be paid until maturity 
as of december   million of this additional interest was converted to a term loan 
as a result  at december   we had million outstanding under the term loan of the senior credit facility at variable cash rates of to excluding the of additional interest and we had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at a rate of 
as of december  the remaining million under the revolver was fully available to us 
the credit facility was pre payable at our option 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility were secured by a first lien on substantially all of sba senior finance s assets 
in addition  each of sba senior finance s domestic subsidiaries guaranteed the obligations of sba senior finance under the senior credit facility and pledged substantially all of its assets to secure such guarantee 
in addition  sba communications and telecommunications pledged  on a non recourse basis  all of the common stock of telecommunications and sba senior finance  respectively  to secure sba senior finance s obligations under this senior credit facility 
this prior senior credit facility  as amended  required sba senior finance to maintain specified financial ratios  including ratios regarding its leverage  debt service  cash interest expense and fixed charges

the senior credit facility contained affirmative and negative covenants that  among other things  restricted sba senior finance s and its subsidiaries ability to incur debt and liens  sell assets  make or commit to make capital expenditures  enter into affiliate transactions or sale leaseback transactions  and or build towers without anchor tenants 
additionally  as of december   we were in full compliance with all of the financial covenants of this facility 
january senior credit facility on january   sba senior finance closed on a new senior credit facility in the amount of million 
this facility consists of a million term loan which was funded at closing  a million delayed draw term loan which we have until november  to draw  and a million revolving line of credit 
the revolving lines of credit may be borrowed  repaid and redrawn 
amortization of the term loans commence september at an annual rate of in each of   and all remaining amounts under the term loan are due october  there is no amortization of the revolving loans and all amounts outstanding under the revolving facility are due on august  amounts borrowed under this facility accrue interest at either the base rate  as defined in the agreement  plus basis points or a euro dollar rate plus basis points
