item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview chindex international  inc  is a delaware corporation with headquarters located in the washington  dc metropolitan area 
the company was founded in and currently is a leading american provider of healthcare products and services to china  including hong kong 
we operate in three business segments o medical capital equipment division 
this division markets  sells and facilitates the export of select capital healthcare equipment and instrumentation to china on the basis of both exclusive and non exclusive agreements with the manufacturers of these products 
chindex believes that it is the largest independent us distributor of healthcare equipment in china 
for the twelve months ended march   the medical capital equipment division accounted for of our revenue 
o healthcare products distribution division 
this division  through a network of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in china  imports and distributes off the shelf healthcare instrumentation and health related consumable products developed by third parties 
for the twelve months ended march   the healthcare products distribution division accounted for of the company s revenue 
o healthcare services division 
this division operates the company s private hospital and clinics 
beijing united family hospital and clinics bju opened in and shanghai united family hospital and clinics shu  is scheduled to open in in  we opened our first satellite clinic associated with bju in shunyi county outside of beijing 
for the twelve months ended march   the healthcare services division accounted for of the company s revenue 
substantially all of our assets are located in china and substantially all our revenue is derived from our operations in china 
accordingly  our business  financial condition and results of operations are subject  to a significant degree  to economic  political and legal developments in china 
the economic system in china differs from the economics of most developed countries in many respects  including government investment  level of development  control of capital investment  control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources 
our medical capital equipment division and healthcare products distribution divisions are subject to challenges and risks as a result of our dependence on our relations with suppliers of equipment and products 
in addition  the timing of our revenue from the sale of medical capital equipment is affected by the availability of funds to customers in the budgeting processes of the chinese government  the availability of credit from the chinese banking system and otherwise 
the timing of sales of such equipment may depend on the timing of our customers ability to arrange for credit sources 
further  because we recognize revenue and expenses relating to certain contracts as such products are shipped  the timing of shipments  among other things  affects our operating results for a particular period 
consequently  our operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary from period to period 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include income tax recognition of deferred tax items and accruals for contingencies 
there were no material changes to these items 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition sales of equipment and consumables are recognized upon product shipment 
the company provides installation  warranty  and training services for certain of its capital equipment sales 
these services are viewed as perfunctory to the overall arrangement and are not accounted for separately from the equipment sale 
cost associated with installation  after sale servicing and warranty are not significant and are recognized in cost of sales as they are incurred 
the estimated cost for training services is accrued upon shipment 
revenue related to services provided in our healthcare services segment is recognized in the period services are provided 
revenue includes an estimate of services at the end of the period for patients who have not completed service 
costs associated with such services are recognized in the period incurred 
receivable collectibility the company grants credit to some customers in the ordinary course of business 
it evaluates collectibility of accounts receivable periodically and adjusts its allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly 
bad debts are experienced predominately in healthcare services business and to a lesser extent in medical capital equipment business 
the company has experienced few losses in healthcare products distribution business 
the company incurred bad debt expense of   and  in the year ended march   three months ended march  and the year ended december  the increased loss experience in is the result of periodic review of accounts and resulted in an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts from  at december  to  at march  valuation allowance of deferred tax assets the company s operations are taxed in various jurisdictions including the united states and china 
in certain jurisdictions individual subsidiaries are taxed separately 
the company has identified deferred tax assets resulting from cumulative temporary differences at each balance sheet date 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets in which the company is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized 
the company released deferred tax valuation allowances totalling  and  in the years ended december  and based on assessments in those years that it was more likely than not that it would be able to use its us federal net operating loss carryforwards 
certain of these benefits were realized in tax filings for the period ended march while losses were incurred in the us in fiscal year  the company s assessment  based on expected income in and  is that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
these us net operating loss carryforwards do not expire before the company has provided substantial deferred tax valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets related to various subsidiaries in china because it is not able to conclude that it is more likely than not that those assets will be realized 
fiscal compared to twelve months ended december  general the company s revenue for fiscal was  up from the twelve months ended december  revenue of  the company experienced continued revenue growth in each of the three segments of the business  with revenue growth of in the medical capital equipment segment  in the healthcare products distribution segment  and in the healthcare services segment  compared to the twelve months ended december  costs and expenses were  for fiscal as compared with costs and expenses of  for the twelve months ended december  the company recorded a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to net income of  for the twelve months ended december  each of the three segments of the company experienced an operation loss in fiscal the company believes that there are three principal reasons for the loss from operations for the fiscal year 
first  the fiscal year was marked by the extraordinary experience of dealing with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars  which had a significant negative impact in a variety of ways on the company s business 
normal beijing business activity came to a near standstill resulting in the delay of contract negotiations for the sale of medical capital equipment and hospital visits were far below our expectations as foreign residents in beijing left the capital 
second  the lack of government sponsored loan programs in the period also adversely impacted the volume of sales 
third  the company continued to incur operational expenses in connection with shu  while the opening of that hospital was delayed due to a number of factors 
cost increases for the segments are discussed below 
there were a number of increased costs at the parent level of the company  including for an upgrade of the company s data systems in china and new offices in beijing 
the largest parent level increases  which have been allocated among the segments as described below  include increased payroll of  increased professional fees of  increased accounting and legal fees of  and increased rent of  medical capital equipment segment the medical capital equipment segment exports high quality western medical capital equipment to the china market 
in fiscal  this segment had revenue of  an increase over revenue of  in the twelve months ended december  loss from operations was  in the recent fiscal year compared with income from operations of  in the twelve months ended december  gross profit in fiscal increased to  from  in the twelve months ended december  gross profit margin for the medical capital equipment segment for the recent fiscal year was as compared to in the prior period 
expenses for the medical capital equipment segment in fiscal increased to  from  in the twelve months ended december   and  as a percentage of revenue over the periods  increased to from 
payroll for the segment in fiscal increased by  over payroll in the twelve months ended december   and as a percentage of revenue was compared to for the twelve months ended december  the payroll increase was primarily due to increased sales personnel in connection with expanding the marketing of the segment s products 
in addition  travel and entertainment expenses for the segment increased  other costs increased  over the periods  primarily due to the segment s allocated portion of additional parent level administrative expenses and higher costs for new customs fees related to parts purchases  promotion  meeting expenses  and telephones 
healthcare products distribution segment the healthcare products distribution segment  consisting of medical consumables and personal healthcare products  had revenue growth of to  fiscal  as compared to revenue of  in the twelve months ended december  the segment had a loss from operations of  in the recent fiscal year  compared with a loss from operations of  in the twelve months ended december  we anticipate that revenue growth in this segment will be slower as several customers contemplate and effectuate direct sales and new products are subjected to an increasingly formalized chinese regulatory process 
for example  one significant client  becton dickenson  has recently established a subsidiary in china that will perform the logistical services previously performed by our healthcare products distribution division 
another client  guidant  is establishing a similar subsidiary in china 
both these principals have indicated their interest in chindex continuing to perform value added and higher margin distribution and marketing services for certain products and channels 
this transition away from lower margin logistical services is consistent with the division s strategy of prioritizing higher margin business 
with respect to delays in the chinese regulatory process  the launch of new products is requiring longer lead times  due to the fact that china s regulatory environment is becoming more professional  bureaucratic and transparent resulting in longer regulatory cycle time 
during the regulatory approval process  some products that the division planned to launch encountered delays 
the division s local currency sales of medical consumables and personal healthcare products are made from inventories maintained locally in china see foreign currency exchange to a network of sub dealers and pharmacies 
gross profit in fiscal rose to  from  in the twelve months ended december  gross profit margin from the healthcare products distribution segment for the recent period was the same   as for the twelve months ended december  expenses for the healthcare products distribution segment in fiscal increased to  from  in the twelve months ended december   but decreased to as a percentage of revenue as compared to for the twelve months ended december  payroll for the segment increased  primarily due to increased staff compensation 
in addition  travel and entertainment expense for the segment was relatively unchanged while other costs increased  due primarily to the segment s allocated portion of additional parent level administrative costs  increased other professional fees of  and  in promotion 
healthcare services segment the healthcare services segment consists of two western style primary care hospitals  beijing united family hospital and clinics bju and shanghai united family hospital and clinics shu  which continues to be under construction  as well as an affiliated satellite clinic in beijing 
for fiscal  the revenue from this segment was  an increase of over the twelve months ended december  revenue of  the segment had a loss from operations of  in the recent fiscal year  compared with income from operations of  for the twelve months ended december  during the recent fiscal year  the hospital was significantly negatively impacted by the sars crisis in beijing 
many of bju s expatriate patients left the country and many others deferred visits during the april to august period 
healthcare services costs increased for fiscal to  a increase over the twelve months ended december  costs of  this increase was due primarily to the costs associated with adding to bju dermatology services and an intensive care unit plus  of operating expenses of the not yet open shu facility 
payroll increased by  payroll was of revenue for fiscal and for the twelve months ended december   with all other costs increasing a total of  including increases of  in bad debt accounts primarily related to a systems conversion and periodic assessments of receivables collectibility   in other professional fees and  in depreciation 
the opening of shu  originally scheduled for the fall of  is now expected in the fall of the delay in opening the new hospital is due to a number of factors 
during the sars epidemic  travel between beijing and shanghai was very difficult and proved a major disruption in the schedule 
after the sars experience ended  the company decided to reevaluate the shu design in light of lessons learned during the epidemic 
as a result of this reevaluation  a number of specific design changes were made  such as adding a fever clinic  changing the air conditioning system and increasing the number of rooms where negative pressure could be utilized 
loss on equity investment the company recorded an additional equity investment loss of  which represents the company s pro rata share of additional capital for natural formula asia nfal  a joint venture in which the company has a interest 
the joint venture purchases various cosmetics made by nesh  an israeli cosmetics manufacturer and sells such products into china through pharmacy channels developed by the company 
the investment represents an amount that the joint venture partners determined was required to provide additional working capital for the venture 
the company s investment is in the form of a loan to the joint venture 
the company reported a loss of  for this venture in the year ended december  other income and expenses interest expense on short term debt of  and long term debt of  amounted to  whereas the company had  in the prior period 
over  of debt is for the development of shu that is currently under construction see liquidity and capital resources 
taxes the company recorded a  provision for taxes in fiscal as compared to a benefit from taxes of  for the twelve months ended december  the company s deferred tax asset increased by  this tax computation is in accordance with current accounting standards but assumes a certain level of future profitability 
the company believes this properly recognizes the benefits the company has achieved as a result of its tax restructuring and expects to utilize the losses in fiscal years and the company has provided a valuation allowance on deferred tax benefits related to development expenses incurred at shanghai united since there is no operating history to support a conclusion that realization of the tax benefit is more likely than not 
three months ended march  compared to three months ended march  transition the company s revenue for the three months ended march  was  up from the three months ended march  revenue of  we experienced continued growth in each of the three segments of the business  with revenue growth of in the medical capital equipment segment  in the healthcare products distribution segment  and in the healthcare service segment  compared to the same period last year 
we recorded net income of  for the three months ended march   as compared to a net loss of  for the three months ended march  medical capital equipment segment in the three months ended march   the medical capital equipment segment had revenue of  a increase over revenue of  in the three months ended march  income from operations was  in the recent period compared with a loss from operations of  in the prior period 
gross profit in the three months ended march  increased to  from  in the three months ended march  gross profit margin for this segment for the recent period was as compared to in the prior period 
the increase in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to two factors 
first  we had made this a priority for our sales staff and instituted additional reporting and reviewed margin issues on a contract by contract basis 
accordingly  where a salesperson might previously have been inclined to accept an offer from a customer to purchase our equipment at a less than optimum margin  the salesperson knew that the contract would be reviewed critically once it was brought back to the company s senior review staff 
this created an additional incentive for the salesperson to seek better pricing from the customer 
second  in the recent period there were no loan program sales  which typically are at a lower gross margin because we are not required to provide warranty service 
thus  in periods where there are loan sales  such as the three months ended march   the average gross profit margin is often lower because of the inclusion of these lower margin loan sales in the mix 
expenses for the medical capital equipment segment in the three months ended march  increased to  from  in the three months ended march   and as a percentage of revenue over the periods increased to from 
salaries for the segment in the three months ended march  increased by  from the three months ended march   and as a percentage of revenue over the periods increased to from 
the salary increase was primarily due to increased payroll benefits mandated by the chinese government and increased commissions 
in addition  travel and entertainment expenses for the segment decreased  other costs increased  over the periods  primarily due to additional administrative expenses offset by lower costs for exhibitions 
healthcare products distribution segment the healthcare products distribution segment had revenue growth of to  in the three months ended march   as compared to revenue of  in the three months ended march  the segment had a loss from operations of  in the recent period  compared with a loss from operations of  in the prior period 
the large revenue growth over the periods is attributed to a temporary arrangement with an existing client to handle part of their product line that we had not previously handled and that we will not handle in the future 
the remaining increase in revenue was caused by growth across multiple product lines resulting from strong demand for healthcare and consumer products by our chinese customers as well as our strong competitive position and management 
gross profit in the three months ended march  rose to  from  in the three months ended march  gross profit margin from the healthcare products segment for the recent period was as compared to in the prior period 
the decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the low margin non recurring sale mentioned above 
expenses for the healthcare products distribution segment in the three months ended march  increased to  from  in the three months ended march   but decreased as a percentage of revenue over the periods to from 
payroll for the segment increased  primarily due to increased staff compensation 
in addition  travel and entertainment expense for the segment increased  but was flat at of revenue for both periods and other costs increased  due primarily to increased promotion expense and costs relating to facilities 
healthcare services segment for the three months ended march   the revenue from this segment was  an increase of over the three months ended march  revenue of  the segment had a loss from operations of  in the recent period  compared with income from operations of  in the prior period 
during the recent period  the hospital completed the million expansion of its beijing facility  which contributed to increased patient visits as well as increased inpatient stays over the periods 
total inpatient days in the hospital increased to in the three months ended march  from in the three months ended march   an increase of 
for outpatient clinic visits  total clinic visits increased to  in the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   an increase of 
healthcare services costs increased over the periods from  to  this increase was due primarily to the costs associated with expanded services offered 
payroll increased by  payroll was and of revenue for the three months ended march  and  respectively  with all other costs increasing  including increases of  in development expenses related to shu   in doubtful accounts reserve   in professional fees and  in rent expense 
other income and expenses interest expense on short term debt of  and long term debt of  amounted to  whereas the company had little expense in the prior period 
the long term debt relates to the development of shu that is currently under construction see liquidity and capital resources 
taxes we recorded a  provision for taxes for the three months ended march  as compared to a benefit from taxes of  for the three months ended march  fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  the company s revenue for was  up from revenue of  of these amounts   in and  in were attributable to loan project sales by the company for its customers 
the company believes that this type of financing is important to its customers and will continue to try to offer such financings in the future 
these financings can be very complex and their timing and impact on the company s results are difficult to predict see timing of revenue 
medical capital equipment segment in this segment had revenue of  an increase over the revenue of  in income from operations for the segment was  in compared to income from operations of  in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the gross profit percentage 
the period to period revenue of this segment fluctuate due to financing programs facilitated by the company from time to time and due to fluctuating hospital purchasing cycles in china 
the increase for was primarily attributable to loan project sales by the company to its customers  which were  in the recent year as compared to  in the prior year 
the us dollar based sales of capital medical equipment are often contingent on financing see timing of revenue 
gross profit in increased to  from  in gross profit margin from the capital medical equipment segment for the recent period was as compared to in the prior period 
the gross profit in reflected a different mix of revenue sources having different profit margins 
in particular  in the recent year  the company had less service contract revenue  which carries higher margins  than in the prior year 
service contract revenue in hong kong was down significantly because of the downturn in the economy there 
the company anticipates that service contract revenue will not return to previous levels 
in addition  competitive factors such as the timing and composition of major tenders  as well as ongoing competitive pricing pressures due to chinese government tendering regulations in the sale of capital medical equipment in the recent year yielded lower margins on such sales 
finally  gross margins on loan project sales are generally lower than on the company s other sales because the company is not required to provide warranty service on many of the products sold through the loan programs 
loan program shipments in were more than twice as large as in expenses for the capital medical equipment segment in increased to  from  in  and as a percentage of revenue over the period was the same at 
salaries for the segment in increased by  from and as a percentage of revenue over the period increased to from 
the salary increase was primarily due to increased payroll benefits mandated by the chinese government 
in addition  travel and entertainment expenses for the segment increased  but were flat at of revenue in both years 
other costs decreased  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to lower administration allocations and lower promotion costs offset by increased exhibition fees and bad debt reserve 
healthcare products distribution segment the healthcare products distribution segment  consisting of medical consumables and personal healthcare products  had revenue growth of to  in from revenue of  this increase was attributable to an increase in sales in the hospital and retail pharmacy markets 
the segment had a loss from operations of  in compared to a loss from operations of  in the sales of medical consumables and personal healthcare products are local currency based sales made from inventories maintained locally in china see foreign currency exchange and impact of inflation to a network of sub dealers and pharmacies 
gross profit in rose to  from  in gross profit margin from the segment remained consistent at in and expenses for the healthcare products distribution segment in increased to  from  in  but decreased as a percentage of revenue over the periods to from 
salaries for the segment increased  but remained flat as a percentage of revenue over the years at 
the increase is primarily due to increased payroll benefits mandated by the chinese government 
in addition  travel and entertainment expense for the segment increased  but was flat at of revenue for both years and other costs decreased  primarily from decreased promotion 
healthcare services segment for  the revenue from this segment was  an increase of over revenue of  income from operations in was  as compared to  in during the recent period  beijing united continued to expand the services offered  which contributed to increased patient visits as well as increased inpatient stays over the prior year 
healthcare services costs during were  an increase of over costs of  this increase was due primarily to the costs associated with increased services offered 
the hospital had recently finished expanding its present facility to include space formerly occupied by a sublease tenant 
the hospital also had continued its efforts to explore the establishment of additional affiliated satellite clinics to serve as referral sites 
in this regard  beijing united is affiliated with a satellite clinic that opened in november of this clinic  in shunyi county outside of beijing  is funded by a chindex subsidiary and is staffed by doctors and other health professionals from beijing united 
salaries increased by  salaries were and of revenue for and  respectively  with all other costs increasing  including  in supplies   in rent   to establish a bad debt reserve and  in administrative allocation 
the salary increases resulted from increased staffing for the emergency room and for other expanded facilities as well as additional payroll benefits 
minority interest the company s agreement with its joint venture partner for beijing united calls for the partner to receive of the profits of the hospital 
in  this minority interest in the net local income of beijing united amounted to  as compared to  for this income is directly related to the local entity profitability of the hospital 
the company also recorded a  start up loss on its investment in a joint venture in hong kong 
this was offset by the company s minority partner share loss of  in its new start up hospital venture in shanghai 
other income and expenses other expense other than interest in was  compared to other income other than interest of  for the prior period other income was derived substantially from the sublease of space in the facility housing beijing united that ended on december  the part of the building that was subleased has now been renovated as part of the hospital expansion 
although the company did not anticipate any sublease revenue in  it does anticipate that now that the space is renovated and in service for beijing united  the company will recognize additional revenue through the expanded operations of beijing united  which may offset part or all of the loss of income from the sublease 
taxes the company recorded a  benefit from taxes in as compared to a benefit for taxes of  in this tax computation is in accordance with current accounting standards but assumes a certain level of future profitability 
the company believes this properly recognizes the benefits the company has achieved as a result of its tax restructuring and short term anticipation of future income tax loss carry forward utilization 
as a result of this restructuring the company expects to make use of a portion of its us federal net operating losses and accordingly  recorded a  deferred tax valuation adjustment in addition to last years  recorded on previously fully reserved tax losses 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   our cash and cash equivalents  net accounts receivable and net inventories were   and  respectively  as compared to   and  respectively  as of december  as of march   our short term loan payable was comprised of bank loans of  and extended payment accounts payable to one vendor of  with respect to the vendor accounts payable  the vendor has agreed to provide continuing credit facilities for purchases for a seven year period  each grant of credit bearing interest of five percent per annum and expiring at the end of months  to be replaced by subsequent purchases and payables 
the classification from long term to short term is a result of the maturity of the first group of payables under this program having been less than months at march  as of march   the accounts payable attributable to the vendor financing was  the company is currently completing renovation and outfitting of its hospital facility in shanghai  which has been financed primarily through the vendor financing and local bank borrowings 
the estimated total costs for design and construction  including demolition  is million 
the company has negotiated a loan with the hong kong and shanghai banking corporation hsbc  with which the company has an existing loan relationship relating to beijing united 
this new loan totals million and received final approval june  although the company has sufficient capital resources to complete shu as currently scheduled  it will continue to explore additional financing opportunities  although there are no assurances that such additional financing will be available 
as of march   letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately  and borrowings in the aggregate amount of  were outstanding under a credit facility with m t bank  the company s principal bank 
the borrowings bear interest at over the three month london interbank offered rate libor 
beijing united has a short term financing arrangement in china with hsbc for  in revolving loans bearing interest at over the three month singapore interbank money market offer rate sibor

as of march   the balances on these credit lines were  and  respectively 
the company on behalf of beijing united has guaranteed the full amount of those facilities 
recent issuance of securities as of march   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a limited number of accredited investors pursuant to which we agreed to issue and the investors agreed to purchase at a price of per share  shares of our common stock  together with warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of  the net proceeds to the company from the financing  after deducting expenses of the financing including placement agent fees  were  in connection with the financings  we also agreed to issue the placement agent five year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
on march and april   the initial closings of the financing occurred at which a total of  shares of our common stock together with warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock were issued to the investors 
in connection with the initial closings  the placement agent was issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the final closing of the financing took place on may  at which the remaining  shares of common stock together with the remaining warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock were issued to the investors 
pursuant to the securities purchase agreement executed in connection with the financing  each investor irrevocably subscribed for and agreed to purchase the initial securities and the remaining securities  subject only to  in addition to the delivery of customary closing documentation  the completion of stockholder consent to the financing in accordance with the rules of the nasdaq smallcap market as described below 
in connection with the final closing  the placement agent was issued the remaining warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the nasdaq smallcap market  where the company s common stock is traded  prohibits us from issuing shares of our common stock in an amount greater than of our outstanding common stock  if the purchase price per share in such issuance is less than the greater of book or market value of our common stock  without obtaining stockholder approval 
since the issuance of the shares was at such a lesser price  we structured the financing so that a portion of the common stock and warrants  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of  were issued to the investors at the initial closings on march and april  and the remaining shares and warrants were issued to the investors at a final closing  which occurred on may   more than days after we mailed an information statement to our stockholders 
the company continues to consider various other financing alternatives to satisfy its future expansion  capital improvements and equipment requirements 
the following table sets forth the company s contractual cash obligations as of march  in thousands total thereafter line of credit   vendor financing   capital leases equity investment operating leases        total contractual cash obligations        for information about these contractual cash obligations  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
timing of revenue the timing of the company s revenue is affected by several significant factors 
many end users of the capital equipment products sold by the company depend to a certain extent upon the allocation of funds in the budgeting processes of the chinese government and the availability of credit from the chinese banking system 
these processes and the availability of credit are based on policy determinations by the chinese government and are not necessarily subject to fixed time schedules 
in addition  the sales of certain products often require protracted sales efforts  long lead times and other time consuming steps 
further  in light of the dependence by some purchasers of capital equipment on the availability of credit  the timing of sales may depend upon the timing of the company s or its purchasers abilities to arrange for credit sources  including ex im bank or other loan financing 
as a result  the company s operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary from period to period and year to year 
in addition  a relatively limited number of orders and shipments may constitute a meaningful percentage of the company s revenue in any one period 
as a result  a relatively small reduction in the number of orders can have a material impact on the company s revenue in any year 
further  because the company recognizes revenue and expense as products are shipped  the timing of shipments could affect the company s operating results for a particular period 
at the same time  a growing percentage of the company s revenue is attributable to hospital services and local currency sales through the hpd  both of which have more even revenue streams 
foreign currency exchange and impact of inflation the results of operations of the company for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuation 
since the company receives over of its revenue in local chinese currency  the company has some foreign currency risk 
changes in the valuation of the chinese renminbi or hong kong dollar may have an impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
the company s subsidiaries  chindex tianjin  chindex shanghai and beijing united  sell products and services in renminbi 
for over years the chinese and hong kong dollars have been pegged to the us dollar 
while discussions about the possible removal of this pegged rate have been in the news we do not believe at this time any change is imminent 
also  these currencies are not freely tradable and the company does not have a method to hedge its transactions 
it does monitor the situation globally and continues to keep up with the discussion 
while there can be no assurances that a change will not occur we do not believe any such change will have a large negative effect 
the company has also purchased and will continue to purchase some products in western currencies other than us dollars and has sold and will continue to sell such products in china for us dollars 
to the extent that the value of the us dollar declines against such a currency  the company could experience a negative impact on profitability 
the company anticipates hedging transactions wherever possible to minimize such negative impacts 
currently there are no such hedges

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in a variety of ways 
the principal market risk is related to the nature of the chinese economy and political system 
since the company generates all of its revenue from china  any risk having to do with the environment in china for a foreign business operating there can have a significant impact on the company 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss related to adverse changes in market prices  including interest rates and foreign exchange rates  of financial instruments 
in the normal course of our business  we are subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements and currency movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk in the normal course of business and as the company takes on more debt it is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risks through its regular operations and financing activities 
presently the company invests its cash and cash equivalents in high grade commercial paper and other interest bearing accounts 
the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk 
currently the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company is subject to movements in interest rate risks on its credit facilities 
all bank debt outstanding is floating 
the company currently does not hedge its interest rate exposure 
if interest rates were to increase percent  assuming the amount outstanding remains constant  the result would be an annual increase of interest expense of approximately  however  due to uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such environment
