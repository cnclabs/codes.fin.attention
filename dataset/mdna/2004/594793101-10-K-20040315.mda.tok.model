item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview rapid growth in dollar shipments of semiconductors of in was followed by the most severe downturn in the history of the semiconductor industry in customer demand for the company s products declined sharply in as customers reacted to the economic recession in the united states and high inventory levels of semiconductor components by reducing order rates 
the resulting environment  which continued from the beginning of through the second quarter of  was characterized by reduced demand for the company s products  especially from customers serving the high speed communications market  and by poor visibility into future customer demand 
the company s gross profit and net income declined in and due to lower unit volume  declining selling prices for the company s products and an increased level of unabsorbed fixed costs due to lower utilization levels of the company s wafer fabrication lines 
in response to this environment  the company focused on reducing costs in  and the company s objective was to align its cost structure with the reduced revenue levels while retaining sufficient manufacturing capacity  and sustaining a level of research and development investment that should facilitate future growth 
in addition to reducing discretionary spending and payroll costs  the company sought to significantly reduce its manufacturing costs 
one of the company s most significant cost reduction actions was the consolidation of its santa clara  california wafer fabrication operation into its san jose  california wafer fabrication facility 
this action commenced in and was completed in by the end of  the company s manufacturing cost reduction efforts had offset a substantial portion of the erosion in gross profit resulting from the decline in average selling prices see the discussion regarding gross margin 
the company continued to invest in research and development at a rate in excess of of revenues while selling  general and administrative spending was reduced to a level in which approached spending 
throughout the to period the company continued to generate positive cash flows from operations 
as a result of its cost reduction actions  the company returned to profitability in after recording a loss on an annual basis for the first time in its history in primarily due to the effect of charges related to the manufacturing consolidation and from the one time acceleration of stock compensation expense due to the company s stock option exchange offer 
the first half of was characterized by the continuation of limited visibility into  and uncertainty of  customer demand 
the uncertainty of demand was compounded in the first half of by events such as the war in iraq and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in asia sars 
the company s quarterly revenues remained relatively flat  averaging million per quarter for the first half of the company recorded a small net loss for this period 
in the second half of  customer demand increased as the united states and asian economies began to grow more rapidly 
the company s new order rates  or bookings  grew faster than revenue in the third and fourth quarter of  resulting in sequential growth in both revenues and order backlog 
the growth in new orders and revenues in the second half of was driven by demand for the company s standard products from customers serving the communications  computing  industrial and wireless handset end markets 
gross margins and net income increased in the second half of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from standard products 
for  and the company s standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will depend upon standard products sales  although such sales as a proportion of net revenues may vary as the company adjusts product output levels to correspond with varying economic conditions and demand levels in the markets which it serves 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
critical accounting policies and estimates the financial statements included in this form k and discussed within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  income taxes  and litigation to be critical to the fair presentation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition and receivables 
micrel generates revenue by selling products to original equipment manufacturers oem s  distributors and stocking representatives 
stocking representative firms may buy and stock the company s products for resale or may act as the company s sales representative in arranging for direct sales from the company to an oem customer 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
micrel allows certain distributors  primarily located in north america and europe  significant return rights  price protection and pricing adjustments subsequent to the initial product shipment 
micrel defers recognition of revenue and related cost of sales in the balance sheet line item deferred income on shipments to distributors derived from sales to these distributors until they have resold the company s products to their customers 
sales to oem customers and stocking representatives  primarily located in asia  which have limited return rights and pricing adjustments  are recognized upon shipment and a related returns allowance is established based upon historical return rates 
the company s total allowance for returns was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
actual future returns could be different than the returns allowance established 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible accounts receivables 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
the company s total allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
actual future uncollectible amounts could exceed the doubtful accounts allowance established 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to write down the cost of obsolete and excess inventory to the estimated market value based on historical and forecasted demand for its products 
if actual future demand for the company s products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
this treatment is in accordance with accounting research bulletin and sec staff accounting bulletin restructuring and impairment charges 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary timing differences between book and tax valuation of assets and liabilities  state and federal research and development credit carryforwards and state manufacturers credit carryforwards 
the company had net deferred tax assets of million as of december   as compared to million as of december  the reduction in deferred assets resulted primarily from the reversal of temporary timing differences associated with the closure of the company s santa clara  ca wafer fabrication facility during the company must assess the likelihood that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to ultimately realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company believes that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets and has not established a valuation allowance 
should the company determine that future realization of these tax benefits is not likely  a valuation allowance would be established  which would increase the company s tax provision in the period of such determination 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company records liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on its estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
actual tax liabilities may be different than the recorded estimates and could result in an additional charge or benefit to the tax provision in the period when the ultimate tax assessment is determined 
litigation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company is currently involved in such intellectual property litigation see note of notes to financial statements and has not accrued a liability for such litigation 
the company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be made 
an estimated liability would be accrued when it is determined to be probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the company were to determine that such a liability was probable and could be reasonable estimated  the adjustment would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation manufacturing facility impairment restructuring expense acquisition expenses total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income net revenues 
net revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in primarily due to increased standard product revenues  which were partially offset by decreased custom and foundry revenues 
standard product revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for this increase resulted primarily from increased unit shipments of industrial  telecommunications  computer and communications products  which was partially offset by decreased average selling prices across all significant standard product lines 
custom and foundry revenues decreased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for such decreases were due primarily to decreased unit shipments of foundry products 
demand from the company s largest foundry customer declined during and the company expects that foundry revenues will decrease in customer demand for semiconductors can change quickly and unexpectedly 
as a result of the slowing global economy  a rapid build up of semiconductor inventories in global sales channels occurred during  causing lead times for components to fall precipitously 
although it is generally believed that industry wide channel inventories have decreased substantially since  the short lead time environment has continued from the middle of through the end of as a result of underutilization of manufacturing capacity and relatively high levels of work in process inventories within the semiconductor management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued industry 
for over two years  customers have perceived that semiconductor components have been readily available and have ordered only for their short term needs  resulting in historically low order backlog levels 
the company s revenue levels have been highly dependent on the amount of new orders that are received for which product is requested to be delivered to the customer within the same quarter 
within the semiconductor industry these orders that are booked and shipped within the quarter are called turns fill orders 
when the turns fill level exceeds approximately of quarterly revenue  it makes it very difficult to predict near term revenues and income 
because of the long cycle time to build its products  the company s lack of visibility into demand when turns fill is high makes it difficult to predict what product to build to match future demand 
the company averaged approximately turns fill during the company believes the current high turns fill requirements and pricing pressure will continue until lead times substantially increase and order backlogs grow 
the company experienced an increase in order rates and backlog in the second half of  indicating that demand for semiconductors may be increasing and that customers may be becoming more concerned about product availability 
when lead times  order backlog and industry wide capacity utilization increase  as they did at the end of  the semiconductor industry historically has experienced four to six quarters of growth 
however  the sustainability of improved customer demand is uncertain and highly dependent on economic conditions 
the high turns fill requirement together with the uncertainty of product mix and pricing  make it difficult to predict future levels of sales and profitability and may require the company to continue to carry higher levels of inventory 
for the year ended december   net revenues decreased to from million in primarily due to lower custom and foundry revenues and  to a lesser extent  lower standard product revenues 
standard product revenues decreased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for this decrease resulted primarily from decreased average selling prices across all product lines combined with decreased unit shipments of high bandwidth communications products  which were partially offset by increased unit shipments of telecommunications  computer and industrial and ethernet communications products 
custom and foundry revenues decreased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for such decreases were due primarily to decreased unit shipments of foundry products 
international sales represented   and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  international sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the dollar increase in international sales resulted primarily from increased shipments of telecommunications  personal computer and ethernet communications products  primarily in asia  which were partially offset by decreased average selling prices 
the trend for the company s customers to move their electronics manufacturing to asian countries has brought increased pricing pressure for micrel and other semiconductor manufacturers 
asian based manufacturers are typically more concerned about cost and less concerned about the capability of the integrated circuits they purchase 
this can make it more difficult for united states based companies to differentiate themselves except by price 
the increased concentration of electronics procurement and manufacturing in the asia pacific region has led  and may continue to lead  to continued price pressure for the company s products in the future 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross profit 
gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing capacity utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company s gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin primarily reflected decreased wafer fabrication costs resulting from the company s wafer fabrication consolidation plan see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  lower costs for external assembly and test manufacturing services and lower amortization of deferred stock compensation costs see discussion of amortization of deferred stock compensation below  which were partially offset by a reduction in average selling prices as compared to the same periods in for the year ended december   the company s gross margin decreased to from for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin primarily reflected decreased average selling prices  a greater sales mix of lower margin products and decreased capacity utilization as compared to the same periods in after recording a gross margin of in  the company has experienced lower gross margins over the past three years 
as the company grew rapidly in and  its capital expenditures increased to keep pace with customer demand 
when demand for the company s products fell sharply beginning in  the increased depreciation from the fixed asset expansion caused depreciation and other fixed manufacturing costs to increase as a percent of revenues causing gross margins to decline 
gross margins were also unfavorably affected by the sizeable decline in sales of the company s high bandwidth products concurrent with the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
these products typically have higher average product margins than the rest of the company s product portfolio 
the excess channel inventory and reduced demand environment in and resulted in pricing pressure on virtually all products sold by semiconductor manufacturers 
the company experienced price declines for its products during this period and has reduced its manufacturing costs in response to lower market prices 
the average selling price for the company s standard products declined by approximately from to  while the gross profit margin declined by from to  highlighting the magnitude of the overall cost reductions that have been achieved over the past three years 
while the company was able to significantly reduce its costs over the past three years  the reductions were not sufficient to fully offset the decline in average selling prices 
if the global economy continues to expand  resulting in continued increases in demand for the company s products  the company believes that gross margin should increase in future periods 
the company currently has the ability to increase manufacturing output in response to higher customer demand 
should this occur  the company s fixed cost will be spread over a larger sales volume which should result in a higher gross margin 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new processes and the definition  design and development of new products 
the company also expenses prototype wafers and new production mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until products based on new designs are fully characterized by the company and are demonstrated to support published data sheets and satisfy reliability tests 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses represented and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  research and development expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased prototype fabrication costs combined with reduced staffing costs and reduced mask costs 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for the years ended december  and  research and development expenses represented and of net revenues  respectively 
on a dollar basis  research and development expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase was primarily due to increased prototype fabrication and new process development costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the decrease was principally attributable to decreased outside legal costs combined with decreased advertising expenses 
for the years ended december  and  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of net revenues  respectively 
on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the decrease was principally attributable to decreased sales commissions and decreased staffing expenses  which were partially offset by increased legal costs 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
for the year ended december   total amortization of deferred stock compensation was million compared to million in this decrease resulted primarily from million in accelerated amortization in which resulted from options cancelled pursuant to an employee option exchange program see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
manufacturing facility impairment and restructuring expense 
in september  the company approved a plan to close its santa clara  ca wafer fabrication facility to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
associated with the facility closure  the company accrued million in estimated restructuring expenses primarily for equipment disposal costs of million and million for contractual building lease costs  less estimated sublease income  that will provide no future benefit 
during  the company ceased all manufacturing processes within the santa clara facility and completed the relocation of all employees to its san jose  ca facilities 
during  the company paid million in restructuring costs that reduced the previous restructuring accrual and recorded an additional  in net restructuring accrual adjustments which were charged to restructuring expense in as of december   the remaining restructuring accrual was million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual future costs or sublease income may be different than these estimates and would require an adjustment to restructuring expense in the period such determination is made 
also related to the facility closure  in september  the company recorded a million impairment of long lived assets to reduce the net book value of the facility s leasehold improvements and equipment to fair value 
the fair value was based on a third party estimate of the current net sales value 
during  the company sold previously impaired equipment resulting in a  gain which has been recorded as a credit to the manufacturing facility impairment expense 
acquisition expenses 
acquisition expenses for the year ended december   reflect million in direct transaction costs and million in stock compensation costs related to the acquisition of kendin 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other income  net 
other income  net reflects interest income from investments in short term investment grade securities and money market funds and other non operating income  offset by interest expense incurred on term notes 
other income  net decreased by  to  in from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased rates of return on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to the prior year 
in addition  the results included a  expense for the settlement of a patent dispute and a credit of  in other income 
for the year ended december   other income  net decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased rates of return on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments combined with an expense in of  for the settlement of a patent dispute  partially offset by  in other income 
provision benefit for income taxes 
for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes was  or of income before taxes 
the provision for income taxes differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes  state research and development credits  and state manufacturing credits 
for the years ended december  and  the provision for taxes on income was and of loss before taxes  respectively 
the and income tax provisions differ from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state taxes offset by the benefits federal and state research and development credits  and state manufacturing credits 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
principal sources of liquidity at december   consisted of cash and short term investments of million and a million revolving line of credit from a commercial bank 
the revolving line of credit agreement includes a provision for the issuance of commercial or standby letters of credit by the bank on behalf of the company 
the value of all letters of credit outstanding reduces the total line of credit available 
there were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit at december  and there were  in standby letters of credit outstanding 
the revolving line of credit agreement expires on june  borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest rates of  at the company s election  the prime rate at december   or the bank s revolving offshore rate  which approximates libor at december  plus 
the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that include a restriction on the declaration and payment of dividends without the lender s consent 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  in september  the company borrowed million through a commercial mortgage financing agreement which was associated with the purchase of its previously leased manufacturing facilities in san jose  ca 
borrowings under this agreement bear interest  at the company s election  at the daily floating prime rate at december   or adjustable monthly libor at december  plus 
the principal balance of the loan shall be paid in consecutive monthly installments of  and one final installment in the amount necessary to pay in full the remaining outstanding principal balance  with no early payment penalty 
in december  the company repaid million of the loan  resulting in a remaining loan balance of million at december  the mortgage agreement contains certain restrictive covenants with which the company was in compliance at december  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company generated million in cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in compared with was primarily due to a million increase to net income adjusted for non cash activities million net income plus million in non cash activities in compared to a million net loss plus million in non cash activities in combined with million cash flow increase due to reduced inventory levels in as compared to inventory decrease provided million in cash flow as compared to a use of cash in by an inventory increase of million 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities of million were primarily attributable to net income after adding back non cash activities of million combined with a million decrease in inventory  a million increase in deferred income  a million increase in income taxes payable  which were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and million decrease in all other accrued liabilities 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities of million were primarily attributable to net income after adding back non cash activities 
net income after adding back non cash activities consisted of a million net loss offset by non cash activities of million 
non cash activities for included additions of million for depreciation and amortization  million for stock compensation and million for manufacturing facility impairment which were partially offset by a increase in net deferred income tax assets 
the company s investing activities during the year ended december   used cash of million  million less than in this decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to an million facility purchase included in  which was partially offset by increased capital expenditures in cash used for investing activities during the year ended december  of million resulted from net purchases of property  plant and equipment 
cash used for investing activities during the year ended december  of million resulted primarily from in net purchases of property  plant and equipment  which includes million for the purchase of the company s previously leased manufacturing facilities located in san jose  california  combined with the purchase of million in intangible assets  which was partially offset by million in sales of short term investments 
the company s financing activities during the year ended december   used cash of million as compared to cash used of million during the year ended december  this decrease in cash flow used primarily resulted from a decrease in cash used to repurchase shares of the company s common stock which was partially offset by reduced borrowing 
cash used by financing activities during the year ended december  of million was the result of million in repayments of long term debt combined with million to repurchase  shares of common stock  which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock through employee stock transactions of million 
cash used by financing activities during the year ended december  of million was the result of million to repurchase  shares of common stock and million in repayments of long term debt  which was partially offset by proceeds from long term debt borrowings of million related to the purchase of the company s previously leased manufacturing facilities and proceeds from the issuance of common stock through employee stock transactions of million 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company currently intends to purchase approximately million to million in capital equipment and improvements during the next twelve months primarily for manufacturing equipment for wafer fabrication and product testing and additional research and development related software and equipment 
the company is currently authorized by its board of directors to repurchase million of its common stock through december  the company expects that its cash requirements through will be met by its cash from operations  existing cash balances and short term investments  and its credit facility 
since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
in the longer term  the company believes future cash requirements will continue to be met by its cash from operations  and future debt or equity financings as required 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   the company had the following contractual obligations and commitments in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt see note of notes to consolidated financial statements   operating leases see note of notes to consolidated financial statements      other long term liabilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements    open purchase orders   total      open purchase orders are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable pricing provisions  and the approximate timing of the transactions 
these obligations primarily relate to future purchases of wafer fabrication raw materials  foundry wafers  assembly and testing services and manufacturing equipment 
the amounts are based on our contractual commitments 
borrowing agreements consisted of a million revolving line of credit from a commercial bank 
the revolving line of credit agreement includes a provision for the issuance of commercial or standby letters of credit by the bank on behalf of the company 
the value of all letters of credit outstanding reduces the total line of credit available 
there were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit at december  and there were  in standby letters of credit outstanding 
the letters of credit are issued to guarantee payments for the company s workers compensation program 
the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements and has not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated  limited purpose entities or commodity contracts 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors that may affect operating results the statements contained in this report on form k that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements regarding the company s expectations  hopes  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
forward looking statements include statements regarding future products or product development  statements regarding future research and development spending and the company s product development strategy  statements regarding the levels of international sales  statements regarding future expansion or utilization of manufacturing capacity  statements regarding future expenditures  and statements regarding current or future acquisitions 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that our actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth in item business  item legal proceedings  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the additional factors set forth below 
the company s operating results may fluctuate because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond its control 
if the company s operating results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  then the market price of its common stock could decline 
some of the factors that affect or may affect the company s quarterly and annual results  but which are difficult for the company to control or predict are the volume and timing of orders received changes in the mix of products sold market acceptance of the company s products and its customers products competitive pricing pressures cyclical semiconductor industry conditions dependence on third party suppliers the ability to introduce new products on a timely basis the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors the timing and extent of research and development expenses fluctuations in manufacturing yields the ability to hire and retain key technical and management personnel access to advanced process technologies the timing and extent of new process development costs customer demand for the company s products is volatile and difficult to predict 
the company s customers continuously adjust their inventories in response to changes in end market demand for their products and the availability of semiconductor components 
this results in frequent changes in demand for the company s products 
the volatility of customer demand limits the company s ability to predict future levels of sales and profitability 
the supply of semiconductors can quickly and unexpectedly match or exceed demand because end customer demand can change very quickly 
also  semiconductor suppliers can rapidly increase production output 
this can lead to a sudden oversupply situation and a subsequent reduction in order rates and revenues as customers adjust their inventories to true demand rates 
a rapid and sudden decline in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued customer demand for the company s products can result in excess quantities of certain of the company s products relative to demand 
should this occur the company s operating results may be adversely affected as a result of charges to reduce the carrying value of the company s inventory to the estimated demand level or market price 
the weakness in the global economy in   and has caused the end markets that the company s customers serve to grow less rapidly  or in some cases  contract 
the resulting uncertainty of demand has caused most of the company s customers to err on the side of caution until they see signs of order strength for their end products 
in this environment  customers are not making large purchase commitments  instead  ordering modest quantities to fill known short term requirements  greatly reducing the company s visibility into customer demand 
as a result  the company s revenues are highly dependent upon turns fill orders orders booked and shipped in the same quarter 
the reduced level of order backlog coupled with the short term nature of customer demand makes it extremely difficult to predict near term revenues and profits 
the short lead time environment has allowed many end consumers of the company s products to rely on stocking representatives and distributors to carry inventory to meet short term requirements and minimize their investment in on hand inventory 
as a result the company may carry a higher level of inventory at some of its stocking representatives and distributors to service the volatile short term demand of the end customer 
should the relationship with a distributor or stocking representative be terminated  future level of product returns could be higher than the returns allowance established  which could negatively affect the company s revenues and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change  price erosion and increased international competition 
significant competitive factors include product features performance price timing of product introductions emergence of new computer and communications standards quality and customer support in times when economic growth and customer demand is less certain  such as the semiconductor industry is now experiencing  price competition becomes more prevalent 
both the semiconductor industry and the company have experienced significant price erosion since the beginning of if this price erosion continues  it will have the effect of reducing revenue levels and gross margins in future periods 
because the standard products market for ics is diverse and highly fragmented  the company encounters different competitors in various market areas 
most of these competitors have substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than the company 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in either the standard products or custom and foundry products business in the future or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the trend for the company s customers to move their electronics manufacturing to asian countries has brought increased pricing pressure for micrel and the semiconductor industry 
asian based manufacturers are typically more concerned about cost and less concerned about the capability of the integrated circuits they purchase 
the increased concentration of electronics procurement and manufacturing in the asia pacific region may lead to continued price pressure for the company s products in the future 
the significant investment in semiconductor manufacturing capacity and the rapid growth of circuit design centers in china may present a competitive threat to established semiconductor companies due to the current low cost of labor and capital in china 
the company s product offering  while diversified  is highly dependent on certain select end markets 
the company currently sells a significant portion of its products in the high speed communications  computer  networking and wireless handset markets 
these markets are characterized by short product life cycles  rapidly changing customer demand  evolving and competing industry standards and seasonal demand trends 
additionally  there can be no assurance that these markets will continue to grow 
if the markets for high speed communications  computers  networking or wireless handsets that the company serves fail to grow  or grow more slowly than it currently anticipates  or if there is increased competition in these markets  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
an important part of the company s strategy is to continue to focus on the market for high speed communications ics 
if the severe downturn in the telecommunications infrastructure industry continues  resulting in lack of demand for the company s high bandwidth products  the company s future revenue growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
the company s ethernet products have become an important portion of the company s revenues 
if the company fails to develop new products to serve this market in a timely manner  or if the market acceptance of the company s new ethernet products is poor  if a competitor s products unfavorably affect pricing or demand for the company s products  the company s revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company currently derives the majority of its product revenues from sales of standard analog and mixed signal ics and expects these products to continue to account for the majority of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for standard analog integrated and mixed signal circuits  such as competition  product performance or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the markets that the company serves frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
if the company s products are unable to support the new features or performance levels required by oems in these markets  it would likely lose business from existing or potential customers and would not have the opportunity to compete for new design wins until the next product transition 
if the company fails to develop products with required features or performance standards  or experiences even a short delay in bringing a new product to market  or if its customers fail to achieve market acceptance of their products  its revenues could be significantly reduced for a substantial period of time 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dependence on third party manufacturing and supply relationships increases the risk that the company will not have an adequate supply of products to meet demand or that its cost of materials will be higher than expected 
the company faces many risks associated with its dependence upon third parties that manufacture  assemble or package certain of its products 
these risks include reduced control over delivery schedules and quality risks of inadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to the company potential increases in prices potential misappropriation of the company s intellectual property any of these risks may lead to increased costs or delay delivery of the company s products  which would harm its profitability and customer relationships 
additionally  the company s wafer and product requirements typically represent a relatively small portion of the total production of the third party foundries and outside assembly  testing and packaging contractors 
as a result  micrel is subject to the risk that a foundry will provide delivery or capacity priority to other larger customers at the expense of micrel  resulting in an inadequate supply to meet customer demand or higher costs to obtain the necessary product supply 
also  there is a risk that a third party manufacturer will cease production on an older or lower volume process that it uses to produce the company s products 
the company cannot be certain that its outside manufacturers will continue to devote resources to the production of its products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of its products are based 
each of these events could increase the company s costs and harm its ability to deliver its products on time 
the company s gross margin is dependent upon a number of factors  including the level of capacity utilization 
semiconductor manufacturing is a capital intensive business resulting in high fixed costs 
if the company is unable to utilize its installed wafer fabrication or test capacity at a high level  the costs associated with these facilities and equipment would not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower profit margins 
the level of new customer order rates over the past three years has resulted in lower capacity utilization of the company s factories as it has attempted to match production with anticipated customer demand 
the company s gross margins have declined as a result of this reduced utilization of production capacity 
increased order rates in the third and fourth quarter of indicate that demand for the company s products is beginning to grow 
if higher levels of demand continue in the company s factory utilization should increase 
the company s ability to improve gross margins as capacity utilization increases will be dependent upon the company s ability to successfully control expenses and maintain efficiencies as production activities increase 
if the recent improvement in customer demand is not sustained  or declines  and production activity is reduced in response to lower demand in the future  gross margins may deteriorate 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the semiconductor industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand 
customer demand for semiconductor products typically fluctuates based on seasonal patterns 
demand in the third and fourth quarter of the calendar year is typically higher due to the seasonal buying patterns related to the christmas period 
demand in the first calendar quarter is typically lower due to the post christmas decline in consumption 
should actual seasonal demand patterns be different than historical patterns  the company s revenues and financial results may be adversely affected 
the company encounters risks associated with its international operations  including geopolitical risks 
reduced levels of economic activity  or disruptions of international transportation  could adversely affect the company s sales on either a global basis or in specific geographic regions 
three of the company s top ten direct customers are located in south korea 
in the event that current political tensions surrounding north korea evolve into military or social conflict  the company s revenues  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company has generated a substantial portion of its net revenues from export sales 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its future net revenues will depend on export sales to customers in international markets  including asia 
international markets are subject to a variety of risks  including changes in policy by foreign governments  social conditions such as civil unrest  economic conditions including high levels of inflation  fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates and trade restrictions or prohibitions 
in addition  the company sells to domestic customers that do business worldwide and cannot predict how the businesses of these customers may be affected by economic or political conditions in asia or elsewhere in the world 
such factors could adversely affect the company s future revenues  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company is reliant on certain key suppliers for wafer fabrication  circuit assembly and testing services 
most of these suppliers are based outside of the us the company s supply could be interrupted as a result of any of the previously mentioned risk factors relating to international markets 
the company s international sales are denominated in us currency 
consequently  changes in exchange rates that strengthen the us dollar could increase the price of the company s products in the local currencies of the foreign markets it serves 
this would result in making the company s products relatively more expensive than its competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
the company has not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments 
the cost reduction actions the company has initiated may not be sustainable as business improves 
the company has implemented or initiated a variety of cost reduction actions 
when customer demand improves and revenues increase  it is unclear whether micrel will continue to benefit from all of the cost reduction actions that have been implemented 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s operating results substantially depend on manufacturing output and yields  which may not meet expectations 
the company manufactures most of its semiconductors at its san jose  california fabrication facilities 
manufacturing semiconductors requires manufacturing tools that are unique to each product being produced 
if one of these unique manufacturing tools was damaged or destroyed  the company s ability to manufacture the related product would be impaired and its business would suffer until the tool was repaired or replaced 
additionally  the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process 
small impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  manufacturing equipment failures  wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
the company s future success depends in part on the continued service of its key design engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and its ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular design engineers  and the company may not be able to continue to attract and train engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave its employ in the future 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit  key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could be significantly detrimental to the company s product and process development programs 
the company is subject to the risk of litigation and regulatory action in connection with the restatement of its financial statements  and the potential liability from any such litigation or regulatory action could harm its business 
on january   the company announced that it would restate its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december    and  and the fiscal quarters ended march   june   and september  as a result of this restatement  the company could become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings  or both 
as of the date hereof  the company is not aware of any litigation or regulatory action having been commenced against it related to this restatement 
however  such litigation or regulatory action could be commenced against the company in the future and  if so  the company cannot predict the outcome of any such litigation or regulatory action at this time 
however  if an unfavorable result occurred in any such action  the company s business and financial condition could be harmed 
the restatement also involves certain tax issues that need to be resolved with the appropriate taxing authorities 
the company has recorded a liability in its financial statements with respect to these tax issues 
the company cannot predict the results of its discussions with the appropriate tax authorities regarding the tax implications of its restatement and accordingly  the amount of actual financial impact may differ from the amount recorded in the company s financial statements 
the company may not be able to protect its intellectual property adequately  or could be harmed by litigation involving its patents and proprietary rights 
the company s future success depends in part upon its intellectual property  including patents  trade secrets  know how and continuing technology innovation 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
there can be no assurance that any patent owned by the company will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages or that any of its pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to the company s technology  duplicate technology or design around the patents owned by the company 
additionally  the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that existing claims or any other assertions or claims for indemnity resulting from infringement claims will not adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company faces risks associated with acquisitions it has completed and will face risks associated with any future acquisitions 
the company has made acquisitions in the past and may make acquisitions in the future 
the risks involved with acquisitions include diversion of management s attention failure to retain key personnel amortization of acquired intangible assets customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with the acquired company the cost associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired operations assumption of unknown liabilities any of these risks could materially harm the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  any acquisition involves a significant amount of integration of two companies that have previously operated independently 
no assurance can be given that difficulties will not be encountered in integrating certain products  technologies or operations of the acquired companies or that the benefits expected from such integration will be realized 
there can be no assurance that any of the acquired companies will retain its key personnel  that the engineering teams of micrel and the acquired companies will successfully cooperate and realize any technological benefits or that micrel or the acquired companies will realize any of the other anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
in addition  the consummation of an acquisition could result in the cancellation  termination or non renewal of arrangements with the acquired company by suppliers  distributors or customers  or the termination of negotiations or delays in ordering by prospective customers as a result of uncertainties that may be perceived as a result of the acquisition 
any significant amount of cancellations  terminations  delays or non renewals of arrangements with the acquired company or loss of key employees or termination of negotiations or delays in ordering could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results or financial condition of the acquired company and micrel after the acquisition 
in addition  some of the past acquisitions have been accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting which means the acquisitions are subject to rules established by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
these rules are complex and the interpretation of them is subject to change 
additionally  the availability of pooling of interests accounting treatment for a business combination depends in part upon circumstances and events occurring after the acquisition 
the failure of a past business combination that has been accounted for under the pooling of interests accounting method to qualify for this accounting treatment would materially harm the company s reported and future earnings and likely  the price of its common stock 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued market conditions may lead the company to initiate additional cost reduction plans  which may negatively affect near term operating results 
as a result of weak customer demand  competitive pricing pressures  excess capacity  weak economic conditions or other factors  the company may decide to initiate additional actions to reduce the company s cost structure and improve the company s future operating results 
the cost reduction actions may require incremental costs to implement  which could negatively affect the company s operating results in periods when the incremental costs or liabilities are incurred 
the company s ability to manufacture sufficient wafers to meet demand could be severely hampered by natural disasters 
the company s existing wafer fabrication facility is located in northern california and this facility may be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake or prolonged drought  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company could incur substantial fines or litigation costs associated with its storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production  alteration of the company s manufacturing processes or a cessation of operations 
in addition  these regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its facilities at their present locations or construct or operate a new wafer fabrication facility or could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges 
the company s failure to appropriately control the use of  disposal or storage of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject it to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on its business
