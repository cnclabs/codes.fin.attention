item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
statements regarding future economic performance  management s plans and objectives  and any statements concerning its assumptions related to the foregoing contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation constitute forward looking statements 
certain factors  which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements  accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this report  including without limitation  the factors disclosed under risk factors 
general sales consist primarily of charges to customers for delivery services and weekly or monthly charges for recurring services  such as facilities management 
sales are recognized when the service is performed 
the yield value per transaction for a particular service is dependent upon a number of factors including size and weight of articles transported  distance transported  special handling requirements  requested delivery time and local market conditions 
generally  articles of greater weight transported over longer distances and those that require special handling produce higher yields 
cost of sales consists of costs relating directly to performance of services  including driver and messenger costs  third party delivery charges  insurance and workers compensation costs 
substantially all of the drivers used by the company provide their own vehicles  and approximately of these owner operators are independent contractors as opposed to employees of the company 
drivers and messengers are generally compensated based on a percentage of the delivery charge 
consequently  the company s driver and messenger costs are variable in nature 
to the extent that the drivers and messengers are employees of the company  employee benefit costs related to them  such as payroll taxes and insurance  are also included in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include salaries  wages and benefit costs incurred at the branch level related to taking orders and dispatching drivers and messengers  as well as administrative costs related to such functions 
also included in sg a expenses are regional and corporate level marketing and administrative costs and occupancy costs related to branch and corporate locations 
generally  the company s on demand services provide higher gross profit margins than do scheduled distribution or fleet management services because driver compensation for on demand services is generally lower as a percentage of sales from such services 
however  scheduled distribution and fleet management services generally have fewer administrative requirements related to order taking  dispatching drivers and billing 
as a result of these variances  the company s margins are dependent in part on the mix of business for a particular period 
the company has no significant investment in transportation equipment 
depreciation and amortization expense primarily relates to depreciation of office  communication and computer equipment  and software and the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the company s various acquisitions  each of which has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
effective august  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
which requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill 

table of contents a significant portion of the company s sales is generated in canada 
for the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s sales were generated in canada 
before deduction of corporate costs  the majority of which are incurred in the us  the cost structure of the company s operations in the us and in canada is similar 
the conversion rate of canadian dollars to us dollars increased during the fiscal year ending july  compared to july  and increased during the fiscal year ending july  compared to july  as the canadian dollar is the functional currency for the company s canadian operations  these changes in the exchange rate have affected the company s reported sales 
the effect of these changes on the company s net income loss for the fiscal years ended july   and has not been significant  although there can be no assurance that fluctuations in such currency exchange rate will not  in the future  have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
the company reviews all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their issuance 
intangibles intangibles arise from acquisitions accounted for as purchased business combinations and include goodwill  covenants not to compete and other identifiable intangibles and from the payment of financing costs associated with the company s credit facility 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over all tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
effective august  the company adopted sfas no 
 which requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that the company identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
the company s operations are conducted in two geographic regions  canada and the united states 
these two regions were identified as reporting units in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
because discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of these regions 
in fiscal  management performed a valuation on each of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow model 
this model indicated a valuation that was far in excess of the company s market capitalization  however  management did not believe this could be used as the sole indicator of fair value 
accordingly  the company engaged an independent business valuation firm to perform a valuation of these reporting units 
the independent firm utilized a methodology combining the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach is based on the present value of future economic benefits that accrue to the shareholders 
the market approach establishes value through the analysis of the market price of the common stock of comparable  publicly traded companies 
the independent firm s conclusion of the value of dynamex was derived by applying a weight of to the value determined under the income approach and to the value determined under the market approach 
using this valuation as the purchase price in a purchase price allocation model  the implied value of the goodwill for the united states segment was approximately million  compared to a carrying value of approximately million 
as a result  the company recognized a goodwill impairment loss related to this segment of million 
although the performance of the united states operations has improved  the large amount of goodwill recorded during the competitive acquisition environment of the late s was not fully supported by the valuation model 
the implied value of the goodwill for the company s canadian operations was in excess of million compared to a carrying value of approximately million 
the company completed its goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded the million charge net of million of deferred tax benefits as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations 
in fiscal and  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter 
based on this test  the fair value of the goodwill exceeded the carrying amount in both periods 
other intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from to years 

table of contents self insured claims liability the company is primarily self insured for us workers compensation claims 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but unreported losses  are recorded based on the company s estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred 
the company s estimates are based on actual experience and historical assumptions of development of unpaid liabilities over time 
factors affecting the determination of amounts to be accrued for workers compensation claims include  but are not limited to  cost  frequency  or payment patterns resulting from new types of claims  the hazard level of our operations  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions  court interpretations  changes in the medical conditions of claimants and economic factors such as inflation 
the method of calculating the estimated accrued liability for workers compensation claims is subject to inherent uncertainty 
if actual results are less favorable than what are used to calculate the accrued liability  the company would have to record expenses in excess of what has already been accrued 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
estimates are used in determining this allowance based on the company s historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of accounts receivable by aging category 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company has maintained the allowance at july  and july  at approximately of outstanding accounts receivable 
income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting 
the net deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
as of july   the company had available us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income of million 
in addition  the company generated unused foreign tax credits related to its canadian operations and other tax credits of million

during the year ended july   the company determined that it was more likely than not that the benefits of the net operating loss nol carryforward totaling  at july  would be realized  based on first half results for the current year and projected results over the next three years 
the company had previously provided a valuation allowance on this nol  and based on the determination that the company would be able to realize the nol  reversed the valuation allowance during the second quarter of the fiscal year  resulting in a credit to income tax expense of approximately million 
the company s current valuation allowances primarily relate to a foreign tax credit carryforward of approximately  and a workers opportunity tax credit wotc carryforward of approximately  the company continually reviews the adequacy of the valuation allowances and releases the allowances when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized 
stock based compensation statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
encourages but does not require companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company had previously elected to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no

been applied to all awards granted after 
table of contents august  as discussed below  option expense in amounted to under the fair value approach  compared to no expense in under the intrinsic value method 
based on the outstanding and unvested awards as of july   the anticipated effect on net income for fiscal  net of taxes  will be approximately  foreign currency translation assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated at average rates during the year 
the net exchange differences resulting from these translations are recorded in stockholders equity

this improvement results from higher gross profit associated with increased sales  lower interest expense due to reduction in outstanding debt and lower depreciation and amortization expense 
these improvements were offset  in part  by increased sg a expenses 
sales for the year ended july  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended july  scheduled  distribution and outsourcing services increased million compared to the prior year while on demand sales increased million 
the average conversion rate between the 
table of contents canadian dollar and the us dollar increased over the prior year period  which had the effect of increasing sales for the year by approximately million had the conversion rate been the same as the prior year period 
excluding the effect of this increase  sales would have been approximately higher for the year ended july  compared to the prior year 
if the exchange rate had been the same in as it was in  on demand sales would have decreased approximately million  or  in the current year and scheduled  distribution and outsourcing services would have shown an increase of million  or 
cost of sales for the year ended july  increased million  or  to million and increased as a percentage of sales from to compared to the year ended july  the primary reason for the increase in cost of sales percentage continues to be the change in business mix 
scheduled  distribution and outsourcing services generally require larger vehicles than on demand sales resulting in a higher cost of purchased transportation  however  on demand sales are transaction intensive requiring more people to receive orders  dispatch drivers  bill customers and collect and process payments received 
sales of scheduled  distribution and outsourcing services comprised approximately and of total sales for the years ended july  and  respectively 
on demand sales were approximately of total sales in the current year compared to in the prior year 
sg a expenses increased million  or for the year ended july   to million from million in the prior year 
approximately million of this increase is due to the increase in the exchange rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar

as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were for the year ended july   compared to for the year ended july  depreciation and amortization for the year ended july  was million compared to million for the year ended july  management does not expect a significant change in the level of depreciation and amortization expense due to limited capital requirements associated with its non asset based business 
interest expense was million  a decrease of 
million or for the year ended july  compared to the prior year 
interest expense in the current period included the write off of 
million in unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing of the company s credit facility at the end of the second quarter of fiscal excluding this charge  interest expense as a percentage of sales was compared to last year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to lower outstanding debt and a lower interest rate 
the effective income tax rate was for the year ended july  compared to for the prior year period 
the current year includes a million tax benefit realized from the recognition of a us net operating loss carryforward of approximately million in the second quarter that was not recognized in prior years due to the uncertainty of realization 
based on first half results for the current year and projected results over the next three years  that uncertainty was overcome 
the prior year includes the benefit of us net operating losses of million that were used to offset current taxable income and the recognition of a foreign tax credit of million

table of contents comprehensive menu of services  and during a soft economy clients are drawn to the benefits of our scheduled  distribution and outsourcing services 
sales of these services increased million  or over last year  while on demand sales declined  or

cost of sales increased million to million in compared to million in the prior year

the remaining increase is due principally to higher compensation and benefits associated with the lifting of the salary freeze earlier this fiscal year  additional operating personnel to handle new business  higher sales commissions related to new business  additional sales personnel and higher unemployment taxes and medical insurance premiums 
the increase in compensation and employee benefits was partially offset by reductions in communications costs million and legal and professional fees million
