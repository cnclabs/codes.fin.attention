overview we are a real estate investment trust that owns and manages a portfolio of mortgage backed securities and agency debentures 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders from the spread between the interest income on our investment securities and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of investment securities 
we are primarily engaged in the business of investing  on a leveraged basis  in mortgage pass through certificates  collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage backed securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans collectively  mortgage backed securities 
we also invest in federal home loan bank fhlb  federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  and federal national mortgage association fnma debentures 
the mortgage backed securities and agency debentures are collectively referred to herein as investment securities 
under our capital investment policy  at least of our total assets must be comprised of high quality mortgage backed securities and short term investments 
high quality securities means securities that are rated within one of the two highest rating categories by at least one of the nationally recognized rating agencies  are unrated but are guaranteed by the united states government or an agency of the united states government  or are unrated but we determine them to be of comparable quality to rated high quality mortgage backed securities 
the remainder of our assets  comprising not more than of our total assets  may consist of other qualified reit real estate assets which are unrated or rated less than high quality  but which are at least investment grade rated bbb or better by standard poor s corporation s p or the equivalent by another nationally recognized rating agency or  if not rated  we determine them to be of comparable credit quality to an investment which is rated bbb or better 
we may acquire mortgage backed securities backed by single family residential mortgage loans as well as securities backed by loans on multi family  commercial or other real estate related properties 
to date  all of the mortgage backed securities that we have acquired have been backed by single family residential mortgage loans 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
pursuant to the current federal tax regulations  one of the requirements of maintaining its status as a reit is that we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders  subject to certain adjustments 
the results of our operations are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the results of our operations primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of and demand for such assets 
our net interest income  which reflects the amortization of purchase premiums  varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  borrowing costs and prepayment speeds  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
prepayment speeds  as reflected by the constant prepayment rate  or cpr  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
in general  as prepayment speeds on our mortgage backed securities portfolio increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing the net yield on such assets 
the cpr on our investment securities portfolio averaged and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
since changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to effectively manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks while maintaining our status as a reit 
the following table presents the cpr experienced on our mortgage backed securities portfolio  on an annualized basis  for the quarterly periods presented 
quarter ended cpr december  september  june  march  december  we believe that the cpr in future periods will depend  in part  on changes in and the level of market interest rates across the yield curve  with higher cprs expected during periods of declining interest rates and lower cprs expected during periods of rising interest rates 
we have extended contractual maturities on borrowings  such that  our weighted average contractual maturity on our repurchase agreements was days at december   as compared to days at december  the table below provides quarterly information regarding our average balances  interest income  interest expense  yield on assets  cost of funds and net interest income for the quarterly periods presented

we continue to explore alternative business strategies  alternative investments and other strategic initiatives to complement our core business strategy of investing  on a leveraged basis  in high quality investment securities 
no assurance  however  can be provided that any such strategic initiative will or will not be implemented in the future 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the amounts reported our financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements 
the following is a summary of our policies most affected by management s judgments  estimates and assumptions 
market valuation of investment securities all assets classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  based on market prices 
although we generally intend to hold most of its investment securities until maturity  we may  from time to time  sell any of our investment securities as part of its overall management of our statement of financial condition 
accordingly  this flexibility requires us to classify all of our investment securities as available for sale 
our policy is to obtain market values from three independent sources and record the market value of the securities based on the average of the three 
unrealized losses on investment securities that are considered other than temporary  as measured by the amount of decline in fair value attributable to factors other than temporary  are recognized in income and the cost basis of the mortgage backed securities is adjusted 
there were no such adjustments for the years ended december    and investment securities transactions are recorded on the trade date 
purchases of newly issued securities are recorded when all significant uncertainties regarding the characteristics of the securities are removed  generally shortly before settlement date 
realized gains and losses on such transactions are determined on the specific identification basis 
interest income interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the outstanding principal amount of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of the investment securities are amortized into interest income over the lives of the securities using the interest method 
our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance  street consensus prepayment speeds  and current market conditions 
repurchase agreements we finance the acquisition of our investment securities through the use of repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at their contractual amounts  including accrued interest  as specified in the respective agreements 
accrued interest is recorded as a separate line item 
income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a reit and intend to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code with respect thereto 
accordingly  we will not be subjected to federal income tax to the extent of its distributions to shareholders and as long as certain asset  income and stock ownership tests are met 
results of operations net income summary for the year ended december   our net income was million or basic earnings per average share  as compared to million or basic earnings per average share for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our net income was million  or basic earnings per average share 
net income per average share decreased by and total net income decreased million for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  the reason for the decline in net income was due to the interest rate spread decreased to in from for the prior year 
the primary reason for the decline in interest rate spread is the amortization of premium paid on the mortgage backed securities 
the total amortization for the year ended december  was million and for the year ended december  was million 
the trend of record prepayment levels began to decline in the fourth quarter of the year 
this was evidenced by the amortization for the fourth quarter of million  in comparison to the third quarter of of million 
net income per average share increased by and total net income increased by million for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  the increase in net income over is attributable to our acquisition of additional mortgage backed securities using proceeds raised from our january public offering and equity shelf program during the year and the increase in the interest rate spread between our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities 
we compute our net income per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of outstanding common stock during the period  which was  for the year ended december    for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  dividends per share for the year ended december  were  or an aggregate of million 
dividends per share for the year ended december  were per share  or million in total 
dividends per share for the year ended december  were per share  or million in total 
our return on average equity was for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  the decrease in return on equity in compared to is primarily due to a decline in spread income

a portion of our income was generated by gains on the sales of our mortgage backed securities 
our interest income was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  our yield on average earning assets was   and for the same respective periods 
our yield on average earning assets decreased by for the year ended december  in comparison to the prior year 
the declining yields were the direct result of increased amortization on our assets due to the rise in prepayments  especially in the third quarter of the homeowners prepayment option makes the average term  yield and performance of a mortgage backed security uncertain because of the uncertainty in timing the return of principal 
in general  prepayments decrease the total yield on a bond purchased at a premium  because over the life of the bond that premium has to be amortized 
the faster prepayments  the shorter the life of the security  which results in increased amortization 
our average earning asset balance increased by billion for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year 
our asset base increased resulting from the inflow of capital from our public offering and equity shelf program during the year ended december  even with increased average earning assets  interest income declined because of the basis point decline in yield on average earning assets 
our yield on average earning assets decreased by basis points and our average earning asset balance increased by billion for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year 
due to the increase in assets resulting from the three public offerings during the year ended december   interest income increased by million 
the table below shows our average balance of cash equivalents and investment securities  the yields we earned on each type of earning assets  our yield on average earning assets and our interest income for the years ended december      and  and the four quarters in average earning asset yield ratios for the four quarters in are annualized  dollars in thousands yield on yield on yield on average average average average average average cash investment earning cash investment earning interest equivalents securities assets equivalents securities assets income for the year ended december     for the year ended december     for the year ended december     for the year ended december     for the year ended december     for the quarter ended december     for the quarter ended september     for the quarter ended june     for the quarter ended march     the constant prepayment rate increased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the homeowners prepayment option makes the average term yield and performance of a mortgage backed security uncertain because of the uncertainty in timing the return of principal 
in general  prepayment decrease the total yield on a bond purchased at a premium  because over life of the bond that premium has to be amortized 
the faster prepayments  the shorter the life of the security  which results in the increased amortization 
the total amortization for the year ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
for the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of  amortization was million  million  million  and million  respectively 
the third quarter experienced the highest level of prepayments and in the fourth quarter we experienced a decline in the prepayment speeds  providing evidence that the trend was not continuing 
interest expense and the cost of funds we had average borrowed funds of billion for the year ended december   billion for the year ended december  and billion for the year ended december  interest expense totaled million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our average cost of funds was for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the cost of funds rate decreased by basis points and the average borrowed funds increased by billion for the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  declined million  even with the increase in the average borrowed funds for the year 
since a substantial portion of our repurchase agreements are short term  market rates are directly reflected in our interest expense 
the average one month libor for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the year ended december  this downward trend of short term interest rates stabilized in the third and fourth quarters of  with the average one month libor at for the third quarter and for the fourth quarter 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million  from million to million 
we increased our asset base by raising approximately million of additional capital in as a result  we increased the amounts borrowed under repurchase agreements 
consequently  the increased interest expense for the year is the result of our growth 
the table below shows our average borrowed funds and average cost of funds as compared to average one month and average six month libor for the years ended december      and  and the four quarters in average cost of funds ratios for the four quarters in have been annualized  dollars in thousands average one month average cost of average cost of average average average libor relative funds relative funds relative average interest cost of one month six month to average to average to average borrowed funds expense funds libor libor six month libor one month libor six month libor for the year ended december    for the year ended december    for the year ended december    for the year ended december    for the year ended december    for the quarter ended december    for the quarter ended september    for the quarter ended june    for the quarter ended march    net interest income our net interest income  which equals interest income less interest expense  totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  our net interest spread  which equals the yield on average interest earning assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period  was for the year ended december   which is a decrease over the prior year 
our net interest income decreased million for the year ended december  over the prior year 
this was the direct result of the cpr  which increased from in the prior year to 
the cpr for the four quarters in was    and  respectively 
the third quarter of was the highest weighted average cpr in our history 
the net interest spread for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the year ended december  our net interest income increased by million for the year ended december  over the prior year

the gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  increased by million over the prior year 
even though the gain for the year increased over the prior year  as a percentage of total income it declined 
we do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis  but may from time to time sell existing assets to move into new assets  which our management believes might have higher risk adjusted returns  or to manage our balance sheet as part of our asset liability management strategy 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  g a expenses as a percentage of average total assets was  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively

all of the mortgage assets underlying these mortgage backed securities were secured with a first lien position on the underlying single family properties

all of our agency debentures are callable and carry an implied aaa rating 
we mark to market all of our agency debentures at fair value 
we accrete discount balances as an increase in interest income over the life of discount investment securities and we amortize premium balances as a decrease in interest income over the life of premium investment securities 
at december    and  we had on our balance sheet a total of million   and million respectively  of unamortized discount which is the difference between the remaining principal value and current historical amortized cost of our investment securities acquired at a price below principal value and a total of million  million  and million respectively  of unamortized premium which is the difference between the remaining principal value and the current historical amortized cost of our investment securities acquired at a price above principal value 
we received mortgage principal repayments of billion for the year ended december   billion for the year ended december   and billion for the year ended december  the overall prepayment speed for the year ended december    was   and respectively 
during the year ended december   the annual prepayment speed was the highest in our history at 
the result was record returns of principal for the year  relative to the asset size 
the increase in prepayments in from was primarily because we acquired more mortgage backed securities following our three public offerings 
given our current portfolio composition  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to increase over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would decrease during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would be required to amortize our net premium balance into income over a shorter time period 
similarly  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to decrease over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would increase during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would amortize our net premium balance over a longer time period

weighted average annual period cap none none weighted average lifetime cap at december  mortgage principal value as percentage of mortgage backed securities at december  borrowings to date  our debt has consisted entirely of borrowings collateralized by a pledge of our investment securities 
these borrowings appear on our balance sheet as repurchase agreements 
at december   we had established uncommitted borrowing facilities in this market with lenders in amounts  which we believe are in excess of our trends 
all of our investment securities are currently accepted as collateral for these borrowings 
however  we limit our borrowings  and thus our potential asset growth  in order to maintain unused borrowing capacity and thus increase the liquidity and strength of our balance sheet 
for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days at december  for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days at december  for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days at december  at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
liquidity liquidity  which is our ability to turn non cash assets into cash  allows us to purchase additional investment securities and to pledge additional assets to secure existing borrowings should the value of our pledged assets decline 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for us include cash balances and unused borrowing capacity 
unused borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of our investment securities varies 
our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on going basis through mortgage principal repayments and net earnings held prior to payment as dividends 
should our needs ever exceed these on going sources of liquidity plus the immediate sources of liquidity discussed above  we believe that in most circumstances our investment securities could be sold to raise cash 
the maintenance of liquidity is one of the goals of our capital investment policy 
under this policy  we limit asset growth in order to preserve unused borrowing capacity for liquidity management purposes 
at present  we have entered into uncommitted facilities with lenders for borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements 
borrowings under our repurchase agreements increased by million to billion at december   from billion at december  this increase in leverage was facilitated by the increase in our equity capital as a result of the issuance of common stock primarily through public offerings during we anticipate that  upon repayment of each borrowing under a repurchase agreement  we will use the collateral immediately for borrowing under a new repurchase agreement 
we have not at the present time entered into any commitment agreements under which the lender would be required to enter into new repurchase agreements during a specified period of time  nor do we presently plan to have liquidity facilities with commercial banks 
under our repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to our repurchase agreement counterparties ie  lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
specifically  margin calls result from a decline in the value of the our mortgage backed securities securing our repurchase agreements  prepayments on the mortgages securing such mortgage backed securities and to changes in the estimated fair value of such mortgage backed securities generally due to principal reduction of such mortgage backed securities from scheduled amortization and resulting from changes in market interest rates and other market factors 
through december   we did not have any margin calls on our repurchase agreements that we were not able to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
however  should prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities and or market interest rates suddenly increase  margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result  causing an adverse change in our liquidity position 
the following table summarized the effect on our liquidity and cash flows from contractual obligations for repurchase agreements and the non cancelable office lease at december  thereafter dollars in thousands repurchase agreements    long term lease obligations total    stockholders equity we use available for sale treatment for our investment securities  we carry these assets on our balance sheet at estimated market value rather than historical amortized cost 
based upon this available for sale treatment  our equity base at december  was billion  or per share 
if we had used historical amortized cost accounting  our equity base at december  would have been billion  or per share 
our equity base at december  was billion or per shares 
if we had used historical amortized cost accounting  our equity base at december  would have been billion  or per share 
our equity base at december  was million  or per share 
if we had used historical amortized cost accounting  our equity base at december  would have been million  or per share 
through the equity shelf program  in which we sell shares from time to time at market prices  we raised approximately million in net proceeds and issued  shares during and million in net proceeds and issued  shares during in   shares were purchased through our dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan  totaling approximately million  and in   shares were purchased through our dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan  totaling approximately million 
we did not sell any shares through our equity shelf program in the fourth quarter of in january  we completed an offering of common stock issuing  shares  with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
in  we completed an offering of common stock in the second quarter issuing  shares  with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
in  we completed an offering of common stock in the first quarter issuing  shares  with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
we completed three public offerings during the year ended december  in which we issued a total of  shares of common stock  and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
with our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in market values of assets do not impact our gaap or taxable income but rather are reflected on our balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
by accounting for our assets in this manner  we hope to provide useful information to stockholders and creditors and to preserve flexibility to sell assets in the future without having to change accounting methods 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
the table below shows unrealized gains and losses on the investment securities in our portfolio

a very large negative change in the net market value of our investment securities might impair our liquidity position  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
the net unrealized gains loss on available for sale securities was million  or of the amortized cost of our investment securities as of december   million  or of the amortized cost of our investment securities as of december   and million  or of the amortized cost of our investment securities as of december  the mortgage backed securities with a carrying value of million have been in a continuous unrealized loss position over months at december in the amount of million 
the mortgage backed securities with a carrying value of billion have been in an unrealized loss position for less than months at december  in the amount of million 
the reason for the decline in value of these securities is due to changes in interest rates 
all of the mortgage backed securities are aaa rated or carry an implied aaa rating 
these investments are not considered other than temporarily impaired since we have the ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investments 
also  we are guaranteed payment on the par value of the securities 
the table below shows our equity capital base as reported and on a historical amortized cost basis at december      and  and september   june  and march  issuances of common stock  the level of earnings as compared to dividends declared  and other factors influence our historical cost equity capital base 
the reported equity capital base is influenced by these factors plus changes in the net unrealized gains losses on assets available for sale account

we generally expect to maintain a ratio of debt to equity of between and  although the ratio may vary from this range from time to time based upon various factors  including our management s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities  our liquidity position  our level of unused borrowing capacity and over collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge assets to secure borrowings 
our target debt to equity ratio is determined under our capital investment policy 
should our actual debt to equity ratio increase above the target level due to asset acquisition or market value fluctuations in assets  we will cease to acquire new assets 
our management will  at that time  present a plan to our board of directors to bring us back to our target debt to equity ratio  in many circumstances  this would be accomplished over time by the monthly reduction of the balance of our mortgage backed securities through principal repayments 
asset liability management and effect of changes in interest rates we continually review our asset liability management strategy with respect to interest rate risk  mortgage prepayment risk  credit risk and the related issues of capital adequacy and liquidity 
our goal is to provide attractive risk adjusted stockholder returns while maintaining what we believe is a strong balance sheet 
we seek to manage the extent to which our net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable rate assets with variable rate borrowings 
in addition  although we have not done so to date  we may seek to mitigate the potential impact on net income of periodic and lifetime coupon adjustment restrictions in our portfolio of investment securities by entering into interest rate agreements such as interest rate caps and interest rate swaps 
changes in interest rates may also affect the rate of mortgage principal prepayments and  as a result  prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
we will seek to mitigate the effect of changes in the mortgage principal repayment rate by balancing assets we purchase at a premium with assets we purchase at a discount 
to date  the aggregate premium exceeds the aggregate discount on our mortgage backed securities 
as a result  prepayments  which result in the expensing of unamortized premium  will reduce our net income compared to what net income would be absent such prepayments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to any such entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our dividends based upon our net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
other matters we calculate that our qualified reit assets  as defined in the internal revenue code  are of our total assets at december    and as compared to the internal revenue code requirement that at least of our total assets be qualified reit assets 
we also calculate that of our revenue qualifies for the source of income test  and of its revenue qualifies for the source of income test  under the reit rules for the years ended december    and we also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income 
therefore  as of december    and we believe that we qualified as a reit under the internal revenue code 
we at all times intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act 
if we were to become regulated as an investment company  then our use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate qualifying interests 
under current interpretation of the staff of the sec  in order to qualify for this exemption  we must maintain at least of our assets directly in qualifying interests 
in addition  unless certain mortgage securitites represent all the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages  the mortgage backed securities may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the requirement 
we calculate that as of december    and we were in compliance with this requirement 
recent developments on january   we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire fidac 
at our annual meeting of stockholders  our stockholders will vote on whether or not to approve the merger agreement we have entered into in connection with the acquisition 
the acquisition also remains subject to final confirmation by our board of directors that no events have occurred and no circumstances have arisen that would alter our board s earlier determination that such acquisition is in the best interests of us and our stockholders 
under the merger agreement  our wholly owned delaware subsidiary  fdc merger sub  inc  will merge with and into fidac  and fidac will be the surviving corporation 
the merger agreement provides that fidac shareholders will receive approximately  shares of our common stock for each share of fidac common stock they own 
in addition  fidac shareholders have the right to receive additional shares of our common stock  upon the achievement by fidac of specific performance goals  on or about march   and  calculated based on the price of our common stock and the number of fidac shares they owned 
the value of the shares of our common stock to be issued to the fidac shareholders immediately upon the consummation of the acquisition was fixed at  based upon the closing price of our shares on december   which is to be paid by delivering  shares of our common stock 
the value of the additional shares to be paid to fidac shareholders has been fixed as up to a maximum dollar amount of  however  we cannot calculate how many shares we will issue in the future since that will vary depending on our share price at the time of each issuance 
item a quantitative and qualitiative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of our investment securities and our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets 
we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of interest rates on our operations 
if we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  we may be subject to certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments 
to date  we have not purchased any hedging instruments 
our profitability and the value of our portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and portfolio value should interest rates go up or down basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december   and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
projected percentage change in projected percentage change in change in interest rate net interest income portfolio value basis points basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points basis points asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
we attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of our interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities  except adjustable rate loans  and securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in the table could vary substantially if based on actual prepayment experience 
more than within year to years and months months years over total dollars in thousands rate sensitive assets investment securities      rate sensitive liabilities repurchase agreements     interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative rate sensitivity gap     cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total rate sensitive assets our analysis of risks is based on management s experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our management may produce results that differ significantly form the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in the above tables and in this report 
these analyses contain certain forward looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor statement set forth under the heading  special note regarding forward looking statements
