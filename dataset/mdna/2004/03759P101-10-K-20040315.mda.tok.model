item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview general we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of cancer and gastrointestinal disease 
our research and development efforts are based on our proprietary active immunization and monoclonal antibody technologies 
our lead product candidate is an immunotherapeutic called gdt 
we currently have  in various stages  clinical trials testing gdt in the treatment of various gastrointestinal cancers and non cancer diseases 
we believe that our human data and the safety profile of gdt support the broad applicability and corresponding commercial potential for this therapy in gastrointestinal cancer 
financial operations we do not have any products approved for sale in the united states or abroad 
therefore  we do not generate any revenue from the sale of our products 
we have experienced significant operating losses since our inception in and expect to continue incurring significant operating losses for at least the next several years 
we expect losses to continue over the next several years as we continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals and continue our research and development efforts 
we also expect to experience negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future 
our losses have adversely impacted  and will continue to adversely impact  our working capital  total assets and stockholders equity 
our net loss for the year ended december  was million and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our operating losses are primarily due to the costs of development of our potential products 
these costs can vary significantly from year to year depending on the number of potential products in development  the stage of development of each potential product  the number of patients enrolled in and complexity of clinical trials and other factors 
our ability to achieve profitability depends upon our ability  alone or through relationships with third parties  to develop successfully our technology and products  to obtain required regulatory approvals and to manufacture  market and sell such products 
it is possible that we may never be profitable 
because we have not yet generated any revenue from the sale of our products  we have primarily relied on the capital markets as our source of funding 
in addition  we may seek funding through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  potential products or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
these collaborations may take the form of strategic alliances with other drug companies 
if funding from these various sources is not available at reasonable terms  we may be required to reduce our operating expenses in order to conserve cash and capital by delaying  reducing the scope of or eliminating one or more of our product development programs 
results of operations years ended december  and year ended december  change from to in thousands revenue costs and expenses general and administrative research and development total costs and expenses loss from operations other income expense interest expense including amortized discount dividend and interest income unrealized gains losses from investments net loss general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of expenses related to intellectual property  general corporate and patent legal costs and the salaries of our administrative personnel 
the increase in our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in professional fees  premiums for our director and officer insurance policy and an increase in salary and benefits of our administrative personnel 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in the year ending december  compared to the year ended december  due to increased facilities and allocated salary and benefits costs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses are primarily comprised of the external costs of contracted cros and  to a lesser extent  our external and internal research and development costs which include the salaries of dedicated and allocated personnel and the costs of the dedicated and allocated research and development facilities 
the decrease in our research and development expenses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the completion of recruitment and final stages of our phase ii and phase iii clinical trials 
we do not expect our research and development expenses in the year ending december  to be materially different from our research and development expenses in the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was approximately  for the year and the amortized discount relating to the senior convertible debentures was approximately  compared with interest expense of approximately  for the year ended december  this increase related to the series a debenture of  being outstanding for all of  compared with less than a month during to our senior convertible debentures of  being issued in of this amount   was issued in april and  was issued in june interest expense included the amortized discount that was incurred in connection with our million senior convertible notes we issued in and the interest expense on our million convertible debenture issued in the expenses relating to the million senior convertible notes were non cash expenses and had no effect on our available cash or our cash burn rate 
net loss 
the decrease in net loss for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily a result of our lower external research and development expenses 
we had no revenues from operations for either of the years ended december  or year ended december  and eleven months ended december  eleven months ended december  year ended december  change from to in thousands revenue costs and expenses general and administrative research and development total costs and expenses loss from operations other income expense dividend and interest income unrealized gains losses from investments net loss research and development 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  compared to the eleven months ended december  was primarily due to the increased external costs of cros associated with the development of our clinical products 
net loss 
the increase in net loss for the year ended december  compared to the eleven months ended december  was primarily a result of higher research and development expenses associated with our phase iii clinical trials 
we had no revenues from operations for either the eleven months ended december  or the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations through the sale of our equity securities  convertible debentures and licensing fees 
we sell securities and take on debt when the terms of such transactions are deemed favorable to us or are necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs 
we seek to balance the level of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand with our projected needs to allow us to withstand periods of uncertainty relative to the availability of funding on favorable terms 
these funds provide us with the resources to operate our business  attract and retain key personnel and scientific staff  fund our research and development program  pre clinical testing and clinical trials  apply for the necessary regulatory approvals and develop our technology and products 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital deficit of million at december  during the eleven months ended december  and the years ended december  and  we received gross proceeds from the following sources eleven months ended december  year ended december  in thousands sales of equity securities and sales and exercises of warrants issuance of convertible debentures total the amount of funding we have raised and will be able to raise through sales of our equity securities and convertible debentures depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the status and progress of our product development programs  projected cash needs  availability of funding from other sources and the status of the capital markets 
in  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of our equity securities 
on february  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of our common stock and  warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at per share 
on september  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
on november  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of the  warrants issued in connection with the february sale of our common stock 
on december  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of  warrants issued in connection with our senior convertible notes 
in addition  we issued  and  shares of common stock to satisfy the respective accrued interest obligations on our senior convertible notes of  at june  and  on september  on december   we filed a shelf registration statement with the commission for the issuance of up to million of our common stock 
the shelf registration statement was declared effective on january  we believe an effective shelf registration statement with registered shares of our common stock available for sale gives us the opportunity to raise funding when terms are favorable 
subsequent to year end  in february  we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering at per share and received estimated net proceeds in the amount of million 
we have approximately million of common stock that remains available for sale at our discretion  subject to certain limitations under federal securities laws 
indebtedness as of december  we have outstanding million in convertible debentures  up from million as of december  there was an initial discount calculated against a value of the convertible debentures of million  comprised of the beneficial conversion feature of million and other discounts attributable to the value of the detachable warrants issued in conjunction with the convertible debentures of million 
the discount at december  was million which is offset against the million and is shown as million of convertible debentures in the accompanying financial statements 
of the million  million is our series a convertible debenture 
our series a convertible debenture is a convertible  redeemable  five year note that matures on december  the series a convertible debenture bears interest at a rate of per annum  payable annually 
the debenture is convertible at the holder s option at a conversion price equal to the average closing price of our common stock  as defined in the debenture  at the time of conversion 
the series a convertible debenture contains provisions that place a cap on the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon its conversion  such that the holder thereof shall not have the right to convert any portion of the series a convertible debenture to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion the holder would beneficially own more than of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to such conversion 
the remaining million in convertible notes  which we refer to as our senior convertible notes  were issued in two tranches to accredited investors in on april   we issued million of convertible  redeemable  year  interest bearing senior convertible notes and year warrants to purchase an aggregate total of  shares of our common stock to various accredited investors 
on june  we issued an additional million of our senior convertible notes and a year warrant to purchase an aggregate total of  shares of our common stock to an accredited investor 
the senior convertible notes mature on march  the senior convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable quarterly in cash or shares of our common stock  at our option 
the senior convertible notes are convertible at a fixed price of per share  unless otherwise adjusted prior to conversion pursuant to the price adjustment provisions set forth therein 
the conversion price of the senior convertible notes will be lowered in the event of a sale by us of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock at a per share offering price less than the conversion price of the senior convertible notes in effect immediately prior to such sale 
the warrants are exercisable into shares of our common stock at per share  unless otherwise adjusted prior to exercise pursuant to the price adjustment provisions that are substantially similar to those set forth in the senior convertible notes 
the senior convertible notes and the warrants contain provisions that place a cap on the numbers of shares of our common stock issuable upon their conversion or exercise  such that the holders thereof shall not have the right to convert any portion of the notes to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion the holders would beneficially own more than or  as the case may be for the respective holder  of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to such conversion or exercise 
uses of funds the primary uses of our cash are to fund our operations and working capital requirements  specifically  to fund the continued clinical development of gdt  the clinical and pre clinical studies for our other product candidates  including monoclonal antibodies  and for potential licenses and acquisitions of complementary products or technologies 
our uses of cash for operating activities and capital expenditures during the eleven months ended december  and the years ended december  and were as follows eleven months ended december  year ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities capital expenditures total the net cash used in operating activities is comprised of our net losses and working capital requirements 
as noted above  our net loss increased in due to the costs of advancing our product candidates through preclinical and clinical phases of development  and decreased in due to the completion of recruitment in our phase iii clinical trials 
liquidity based on our current operating plans and our known and anticipated contractual obligations and assuming no further funding or potential revenues that may be generated from product partnering or licensing initiatives we are currently pursuing  we believe that our existing capital resources  which consist primarily of cash and short term cash investments  including the proceeds from the financing activities described in the preceding paragraphs  will enable us to maintain operations and satisfy our periodic interest obligations on our senior convertible notes which we may  at our option  satisfy in cash or shares of our common stock into however  there can be no assurance that changes in our research and development plans or other future events affecting our operating expenses will not result in the depletion of our funds at an earlier time 
our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the following the progress of our research and development program  pre clinical testing and clinical trials  the timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  the levels of resources that we devote to product development  manufacturing and marketing capabilities  technological advances  competition  and collaborative arrangements or strategic alliances with other drug companies  including the further development  manufacturing and marketing of certain of our products and our ability to obtain funds from such strategic alliances or from other sources 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
in the event that we require additional funds  we may be required to sell additional equity securities  convertible debt or otherwise  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners 
if we are unable to complete such transactions  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs 
inflation inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our continuing operations and we do not expect inflation to have any material effect on our continuing operations in the foreseeable future 
interest and other income were primarily derived from money market accounts 
effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  this statement established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a freestanding financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on january   the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin addresses consolidation of business enterprises of variable interest entities 
fin was effective immediately for all variable interest entities created after january  in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin  which delayed the effective date to periods ending march  for all vies  other than special purpose entities 
we have not acquired any variable interest entities subsequent to january  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have or engage in any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  however we believe such differences are unlikely to be significant 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in this annual report 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies include the use of estimates 
the impact of these estimates on results of operations in and are not significant 
we periodically reviews these policies and estimates  the effect of which is reflected as a component of net loss in the period in which the change is known 
convertible debt issued with stock purchase warrants we account for convertible debt issued with stock purchase warrants in accordance with apb no

 accounting for income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes

research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
these costs include external and internal research and development costs  the salaries of dedicated personnel  the allocated salaries of personnel who also perform general and administrative tasks  the costs of the dedicated research and development facilities and the costs of contracted researchers
