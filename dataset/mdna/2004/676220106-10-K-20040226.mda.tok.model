our management views our overall business in the context of the performances of these three principal business segments 
these segments include multiple sales channels consisting of office supply stores  a contract sales force  internet sites  and catalog and call centers  all supported by our crossdock  warehouse and delivery operations 
each of these segments is described in more detail in item  business section  of this annual report on form k 
we operate on a or week fiscal year ending on the last saturday in december 
all years in the discussion below contained weeks 
in june  we expanded our contract business in europe with our acquisition of guilbert  a leading contract stationer 
guilbert sells to small  medium and large companies in france  the uk  germany  italy  ireland  the netherlands  spain  belgium and portugal through a direct sales force and through e commerce and other internet solutions  under the guilbert and niceday brand names 
the results of guilbert are included in our international division since the date of acquisition

without limitation  wherever in this annual report we use the words believe  estimate  plan  expect  intend  anticipate  continue  project  should  and similar expressions  we are identifying forward looking statements  and our cautionary statements apply to these terms and expressions and the text in which such terms and expressions are used

overall dollars in millions sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit store and warehouse operating and selling expenses segment operating profit general and administrative expenses other operating expenses operating profit our overall sales increased in after an increase of in the increase in sales in both periods is attributable to increased sales from our international division and our business services group  partially offset by declining sales in our north american retail division 
positively impacting sales in our international division during was our acquisition of guilbert in june  
table of contents which contributed additional sales of million  the impact of changes to foreign currency rates  and the growth in our existing contract business 
our management believes that the acquisition of guilbert has added significantly to our capability and future business prospects in europe 
our bsg segment experienced increased sales as a result of expanding our contract business  partially offset by weaker catalog sales 
worldwide e commerce sales have improved in all periods  increasing to billion in from billion in comparable sales measure the sales from operations or stores that have been in existence or open for one year or more and is used throughout the md a to understand the relative trends in our business 
from time to time we regroup product categories to conform more closely to the way that we manage the business 
accordingly  certain comparable sales product amounts reported in prior periods have been adjusted to conform to current year classification 
from a comparable sales perspective  total company sales declined in and were flat in  primarily as a result of negative comparable sales in our north american retail division of and  respectively 
the decline in comparable sales in the north american retail division primarily reflects a decrease in sales of our technology and furniture products 
at the start of fiscal year  we adopted new accounting guidance  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
we now classify amounts earned under cooperative advertising arrangements as a credit to cost of goods sold 
previously  these amounts were classified as a reduction of advertising expense 
additionally  a portion of these amounts is deferred in inventory and reduces the cost of products as they are sold  similar to our current practice for vendor rebate arrangements 
to record the initial amount of cooperative advertising deferred in inventory at the beginning of the year  we recorded an after tax cumulative effect adjustment of million  or per share 
the impact on continuing operations of applying this method in decreased cost of goods sold by million and increased advertising expense by million 
operating profit increased by million  net earnings by million and diluted earnings per share by 
prior periods have not been restated 
however  the estimated impact of applying this method in would have been to decrease the cost of goods sold by million and increase advertising expense by million 
pro forma operating profit would have decreased by million  net earnings by million and would have had no impact on diluted earnings per share 
store and warehouse operating and selling expenses consist of personnel costs  maintenance and other facility costs  advertising expenses  delivery and transportation costs  credit card and bank charges and certain other operating and selling costs 
freight costs incurred to bring merchandise to stores and warehouses are included as a component of inventory and cost of goods sold 
warehouse costs and freight costs incurred to ship merchandise primarily relate to our delivery customers  are included in store and warehouse expenses 
because of our multi channel operations  and because some retail companies include shipping  handling and other distribution costs as a component of cost of goods sold  their measure of gross profit may not be comparable to ours 
however  this is how our management has elected to view our business 
reflecting the impact of eitf on all periods  total company store and warehouse operating and selling expenses as a percentage of sales remained constant in compared to and decreased slightly in compared to the increase in for north american retail reflects higher lease termination and facility costs  as well as a lower sales base 
the decrease in bsg primarily reflects operating efficiencies 
operating and selling expenses as a percentage of sales for the international division decreased in reflecting the purchase of guilbert s customer base with its higher mix of large customers  which requires less marketing and related costs  as well as the continued leveraging of certain fixed operating expenses 
these factors are addressed in greater detail in the segment discussions below 
additionally  store and warehouse operating and selling expenses in include costs associated with the company s decision to settle potential class action litigation in the state of california involving wage and hour claims by some of our store managers and assistant managers  and in  a legal settlement  partially offset by a gain on the sale of a warehouse in the united kingdom 
in we incurred million of non capitalizable integration costs in connection with our acquisition of guilbert 
these costs primarily relate to professional consultants used to assist with integration management  communications and human resource aspects of the acquisition and are included in total company operating expenses  but are not included in determining segment profitability 
under accounting rules that became effective at the start of  companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test recorded amounts annually for impairment 
our testing indicated no goodwill impairment 
amortization of goodwill totaled million in the financial accounting standards board fasb is considering a rule change that would require companies to expense the fair value of stock options issued 
the company currently provides stock options to a large number of its employees 
should the fasb s 
table of contents proposal be adopted  and the company continues with its current stock option plan  operating expenses could increase significantly 
see note a in notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of stock based compensation 
in the overall table above  we have provided a subtotal for segment operating profit 
we currently use this measure of performance to assess the operations of each business unit  and we believe it is useful to investors  because it reflects the sales and operating expenses directly related to the segment s activities 
our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs associated with support functions 
because these functions typically support all segments of our business  we have historically not considered these costs in determining our segment profitability 
however  with the growth in our e commerce and the acquisition of guilbert  our general and administrative costs have increased substantially in recent years 
therefore  beginning in  we plan to reclassify certain amounts previously classified as general and administrative expenses into operating and selling expenses 
we also plan to begin allocating costs where appropriate to determine segment profitability 
other companies may charge more or less general and administrative costs to their segments and our presentation therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other entities 
our measure of segment operating profit should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net earnings determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the table above reconciles segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit determined in accordance with gaap 
north american retail division dollars in millions sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit store and warehouse operating and selling expenses segment operating profit sales in our north american retail division decreased in and in comparable sales in from the stores that were open for more than one year were down 
in  comparable sales in the stores that were open for at least one year were down 
the decrease in both years reflects both lower average transaction size and fewer comparable transactions 
additionally  our holiday sales were below expectations 
we believe our sales in and part of were negatively impacted by the overall soft us economy at that time 
in  we expect to drive traffic and sales in our retail channel as we remodel our existing stores  identify and expand alternative store formats  and introduce new merchandising initiatives 
as a result of these activities  comparable sales in the opening weeks of have turned positive 
the trends in product mix experienced in continued throughout and  as overall sales shifted away from lower margin technology products in both periods 
comparable sales of lower margin technology products declined in and in  and comparable sales of business furniture declined in and in sales of core supplies and paper were relatively flat in both periods 
sales of machine supplies  which include ink and toner  were up in  aided in part by the promotion of our ink and toner initiatives in the second half of the year 
however  with the more open presentation of ink and toner in our stores  we experienced increased shrink levels in gross margins in were also negatively impacted by increased clearance activity as we launched several new retail initiatives 
adopting eitf reduced the cost of goods sold for by million and increased advertising expense by million 
had this change been effective for  the pro forma impact would have decreased cost of goods sold by million and increased advertising expense by million 
cooperative advertising credits for totaled million 
reflecting the impact of eitf on all periods  total operating and selling expenses in our north american retail division increased in after a decrease in overall personnel related costs  which represent the largest component of costs in this caption  decreased in both and increases in wage rates and in certain employee benefit costs were more than offset by streamlining certain operational processes which reduced the amount of labor required to operate the stores and by reduced incentive costs in because the segment did not meet overall performance expectations 
lower sales in both periods contributed to lower credit card fees 
facility and facility maintenance expense increased in as we added stores and made changes to our store layout to handle various initiatives 
operating and selling expenses in also include million to settle potential class action litigation in the state of california relating to certain employee classifications as exempt from overtime 

table of contents during  we closed stores  of which were identified as part of our comprehensive business review completed in late we also identified ten additional under performing stores that were closed in because of continued uncertainty relating to sublease assumptions for properties previously closed  the company conducted a comprehensive review of its closed store commitments during the fourth quarter of and recorded a million charge to terminate some existing commitments and adjust the remaining commitments to current market values 
we recorded similar charges in and for million and million  respectively 
additionally  charges for asset impairments for under performing stores were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
we regularly review actual and projected store performance and record any asset impairment charges as a component of store and warehouse operating expenses 
bsg dollars in millions sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit operating and selling expenses segment operating profit sales in our bsg segment increased in and in sales in our contract channel increased in both and the increase in reflects growth in most markets  with the large customer segment growing at faster rates than the other customer segments 
contract sales in the eastern us have displayed a positive trend throughout and and in the western us since mid the catalog channel decreased in both and domestic e commerce sales grew by during the and in we expect continued growth in our e commerce sales during as we allocate additional resources to that channel 
comparable sales of office supplies and machine supplies  the largest category in bsg s sales mix  increased in both and office furniture sales declined in and in  while technology sales decreased in following an increase of in adopting eitf reduced the cost of goods sold for by million and increased advertising expense by million 
had this change been effective for  the pro forma impact would have decreased cost of goods sold by million and increased advertising expense by million 
cooperative advertising credits during totaled million 
reflecting the impact of eitf on all periods  gross profit decreased in and  reflecting the impact of increased sales to larger accounts that tend to have lower margin rates and the increasing proportion of sure 
com sales  which operates primarily in the lower margin technology business 
during  gross margin was higher following the introduction of volume dependent pricing arrangements 
we earn higher gross profit percentages in our bsg than in our retail operations principally because of lower occupancy costs and a sales mix that includes relatively fewer technology products 
personnel  facility and delivery expenses are the largest components of our bsg operating expenses 
reflecting the impact of eitf on all periods  operating and selling expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in both and because of continued efforts to reduce costs and increase productivity and efficiency 
in  we modified our delivery model in certain markets  resulting in lower personnel costs partially offset by increased third party delivery costs following our decision to outsource certain delivery functions in some of our markets 
in  call center consolidation contributed to lower personnel related costs  and the introduction of new technologies streamlined operations and reduced delivery costs by 

table of contents international division dollars in millions sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit operating and selling expenses segment operating profit sales in our international division grew in and in in local currencies  sales grew in and in our purchase of guilbert in june contributed sales of million 
excluding the impact of exchange rates and the guilbert acquisition  sales in both and reflect growth in most of our international operations with the principal exceptions of germany and japan  where local economic conditions were weak during and most of in addition to our acquisition of guilbert  during we further expanded our existing european operations by starting contract operations in germany and launching our retail business into spain  where we opened six retail stores 
in  we also opened three stores in france and a net of five stores in japan 
in  we added catalog operations in three countries  increased the size of our contract sales force in four countries  initiated contract sales in italy  added a net of seven new stores in france  made several changes to our japanese operation and launched nine new web sites 
we expect to continue to grow all sales channels in our european operations 
adopting eitf reduced the cost of goods sold for by million and increased advertising expense by million 
had this change been effective for  the pro forma impact would have decreased cost of goods sold by million and increased advertising expense by million 
cooperative advertising credits during totaled million 
reflecting the impact of eitf on all periods  gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased in both and  reflecting a higher mix of lower margin contract sales  growth in our existing contract business  and to a lesser extent  the increased distribution of prospecting catalogs which feature lower priced products in europe to support growth into new markets 
in  the decrease was partially offset by better buying and increased purchasing discounts following the company s recent guilbert acquisition 
operating and selling expenses as a percentage of sales are higher in our international division than in our other segments primarily because we use an extensive marketing program to drive sales in existing markets  particularly in our catalog business where we use so called prospecting catalogs with lower priced products intended to induce customers to place first time orders 
we also had start up activities in several new markets 
similar to bsg  personnel and delivery expenses are significant components of the international division s operating and selling expenses 
during and  personnel  facility related  advertising  and delivery expenses increased in total dollars because of the expansion of our business in europe 
however  in operating and selling expenses as a percentage of sales decreased  primarily as a result of the purchase of guilbert s large account customer base  which requires less marketing and related costs 
also favorably impacting operating and selling expenses was the continued leverage of certain fixed operating expenses 
as our operations grow in a particular market  fixed operating expenses decline relative to sales 
for example  advertising costs in the form of prospecting and delivery costs  which are affected by the density of the delivery areas  decline as a percentage of sales as the market grows 
fiscal includes a gain of million from the sale of a warehouse in london 
as noted above  sales in local currencies have substantially increased in recent years 
for us reporting  these sales are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates experienced during the year 
international division sales were positively impacted by foreign exchange rates in by million and million in international division segment operating profit also benefited from foreign exchange rates by million during and in future volatility in exchange rates could affect translated sales and operating profit of our international operations 
in january  we sold our operations in australia with no significant impact on earnings 
the australian operations have been accounted for as discontinued operations and all periods presented have been restated 
in addition to europe  we continue to operate in japan 
we have focused our japanese business on a single brand offering and streamlined operations  however  sales trends in japan have been negative for each of the periods presented 

table of contents corporate and other other operating expenses other operating expenses primarily reflect pre opening expenses and  in  costs related to the integration of guilbert 
pre opening expenses consist of personnel  property and advertising expenses incurred in opening or relocating stores and cscs 
we typically incur pre opening expenses during a six week period prior to a store opening 
because we expense these items as they are incurred  the amount of pre opening expenses each year is generally proportional to the number of new stores and cscs opened during the period 
total company store openings and relocations were in  in and in we opened cscs in and in for  our pre opening expenses were approximately  per domestic office supply store and  per international office supply store 
our cost to open a new csc varies significantly with the size and location of the facility 
although no cscs were opened in  we estimate costs to open a domestic or international csc to be approximately million per facility 
in  we incurred approximately million of non capitalizable integration costs in connection with our acquisition of guilbert in june these costs primarily relate to professional consulting fees for assistance with integration  management  internal communications plans  and human resource aspects of the acquisition 
general and administrative expenses dollars in thousands general and administrative expenses percentage of sales our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs associated with support functions 
because these functions typically support all segments of our business  we have historically not considered these costs in determining our segment profitability 
however  with the growth in our e commerce and the acquisition of guilbert  our general and administrative costs have increased substantially in recent years 
therefore  beginning in  we plan to reclassify certain amounts previously classified as general and administrative expenses into operating and selling expenses 
we also plan to begin allocating costs where appropriate to determine segment profitability 
the increase in reflects the inclusion of guilbert since its acquisition in june  the impact of exchange rates on other international expenses  and costs relating to finance  human resources and merchandising software applications 
employee related costs declined in from lower performance based compensation  partially offset by higher costs for healthcare and other employee benefits 
the increase in was attributable to additional professional fees to support operational process improvements  additional benefits costs  and costs incurred to support expansion activities that were not chargeable to segment operations 
the comments above and in the overall section of md a describe how our management has historically determined our general and administrative expenses 
other companies may charge more or less of their general and administrative costs to their segments  and their results may not be comparable to ours 
other income and expense dollars in thousands interest income interest expense miscellaneous income expense  net average cash balances decreased slightly during after a substantial increase in  however  interest rates earned on cash investments declined during the same time periods 
in august we issued million of senior notes that mature in the increase in interest expense in reflects the impact of a partial year of interest relating to this additional borrowing 
similarly  reflects the impact of a full year of interest on the million of senior subordinated notes issued in july and which mature in the effective interest rate on the million notes has been reduced by the amortization of proceeds from an interest rate lock of million 
additionally  the effective interest rate on the million notes has been reduced by the amortization of million from the september termination of 
table of contents an interest rate swap agreement 
the proceeds received from both the interest rate lock and the interest rate swaps are being amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective notes 
when a facility is closed before the end of an operating lease commitment  we record a liability at the present value of the lease obligation  offset by anticipated sublease income 
for facilities closed prior to  the imputed interest cost on the discounted obligations is recognized as interest expense each period 
the recorded obligations primarily relate to the store closures following the business review and total million at december  and million at december  our net miscellaneous income expense consists of equity in the earnings of our joint venture investments  royalty and franchise income that we generate from licensing and franchise agreements  and realized gains and impairments of other investments 
all of our equity investments involve operations outside of the united states and canada 
in  we sold or abandoned a majority of our interest in certain internet companies  resulting in a fourth quarter charge of million 
in and  we recorded charges of million and million  respectively  related to the impairment of these investments 
in  this category also includes recognition of approximately million of net foreign currency gains  primarily resulting from holding euro investments in anticipation of purchasing guilbert in june income taxes dollars in thousands income taxes effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate has decreased over the three years presented  reflecting an increased proportion of international activity  which may be taxed at lower rates and  in  realization of certain state tax credits 
the effective tax rate in future periods can be affected by variability in our mix of income and tax rates in the various jurisdictions and therefore may be higher or lower than it has been over the past three years 
the effective tax rate is expected to be somewhat lower at the beginning of and will be monitored and adjusted throughout the year for the actual mix of income 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized as follows dollars in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities operating and investing activities we have consistently satisfied operating liquidity needs and planned capital expenditure programs through our normal conversion of sales to cash 
over the three years ended in  we generated over billion of cash flows from operating activities 
from time to time  we use our revolving credit facility for normal operating needs  primarily near the time of a significant non operating cash outlay 
we have also accessed the capital markets to supplement our cash position following acquisitions and for refinancings 
our major sources of cash from operations include store sales  a majority of which are generated on a cash and carry basis  our private label credit card program  which is administered by a third party financial services company and converted to cash daily  and collection of our receivables 
we generate receivables from our contract and certain direct mail customers  and as we expand this business here and abroad  we anticipate our accounts receivable portfolio will grow 
additionally  amounts due us under rebate and cooperative advertising programs with our vendors comprised over of total receivables at the end of and at the end of these receivables tend to fluctuate seasonally growing during the second half of the year and declining during the first half  because certain collections do not occur until specified milestones are reached or the program year is complete 
these receivables  however  are typically high quality and are collected quickly after reaching specified milestones 
our primary outflow of cash from operations is the purchase of inventory  net of customary credit arrangements with vendors  operational costs  and the payment of current taxes 

table of contents cash flows provided by operating activities in reflect lower net income as compared to and changes in working capital  more than offset by increases in non cash charges and depreciation 
changes in working capital reflect an increase in inventories coupled with a decrease in accrued liabilities 
the decrease in current liabilities reflects payments on closed store liabilities  accrued employee compensation  and settlement of accrued expenses  as well as the timing of year end purchases and vendor payments 
the increase in inventories reflects lower than expected sales in our north american retail division during the fourth quarter  and an intentional build up of certain products to support the holiday season and  our new retail merchandising initiatives 
we do not believe that the additional inventories add to our product life cycle or obsolescence risk 
the non cash operating items primarily include an increase in our deferred income tax expense  an increase in our closed store reserve  and various asset impairments 
the additional depreciation includes the impact of guilbert assets 
cash flows provided by operating activities in reflect higher net income  partially offset by an increase in overall inventory at the end of the year 
investing activities for include approximately million for payments made in connection with our acquisition of guilbert  net of cash acquired 
the purchase price of guilbert is subject to an upward adjustment of euro million  payable in office depot common stock or cash  if office depot stock closes above per share for five consecutive days over an month period following the closing date of the acquisition 
see note d to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the purchase transaction 
investing activities in also include million we invested in a mutual fund that primarily invests in us government agency obligations and cash proceeds from selling our australian business in january excluding the acquisition of guilbert  our primary investing activity is the acquisition of capital assets 
the majority of our capital asset acquisitions relate to opening or remodeling retail stores and warehouses  as well as internal infrastructure upgrades 
during  we added or relocated a total of stores and consolidated two cscs in north america 
internationally  we opened retail stores 
we currently plan to open approximately to stores in our north american retail division and approximately to stores in our international division during we estimate that our cash investing requirements will be approximately million for each new domestic office supply store 
the million includes approximately million for leasehold improvements  fixtures  point of sale terminals and other equipment  and approximately million for the portion of our inventories that will not be financed by our vendors 
in addition  our average new office supply store requires pre opening expenses of approximately million 
in late  we announced our decision to build a new corporate support center in boca raton  florida 
we estimate that the center will be completed in the early part of at a cost in excess of million  of which approximately million will be paid in financing activities our existing credit facility provides us with a maximum of million in funds  including up to million for issuance of standby and trade letters of credit 
this facility is a year  unsecured revolving credit agreement maturing on april   though the company may enter into a new arrangement before this agreement expires 
the agreement provides for the availability of borrowings up to the equivalent of million in us dollars  euro  british pounds or yen 
the remaining million is available in us dollars 
borrowings will bear interest at a benchmark variable rate plus a spread determined at the time of usage 
for us dollar borrowings  interest can be based on the then current london interbank offering rate libor or us prime rate  at the company s election 
for international borrowings  interest will be based on the then current eurocurrency rate 
we can specify interest periods to be one  two  three or six months 
based on our current credit ratings  borrowings would include a spread of 
as of december   we had outstanding yen borrowings equivalent to million  which had an effective interest rate of  and million of the company s total million outstanding letters of credit were under this agreement 
the agreement contains restrictive covenants relating to various financial statement ratios 
we are in compliance with all such covenants 
in august  the company completed an offering of million senior notes due august the notes are not callable and bear interest at the rate of per year  to be paid on february and august of each year 
the notes contain provisions that  in certain circumstances  place financial restrictions or limitations on the company 
simultaneous with completing the offering  the company liquidated a treasury rate lock 
the proceeds on the treasury rate lock will be amortized over the term of the notes  reducing the effective interest rate to the company for the notes to 
also  in january  we entered into a fixed for variable interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
in july  we issued million of seven year  non callable  senior subordinated notes due on july  the notes contain provisions that  in certain circumstances  place financial restrictions or limitations on our company 
the notes have a coupon interest rate of  payable semi annually on january and july in august  we entered into libor based variable rate swap agreements with notional amounts aggregating million 
in september  we terminated the swap agreements and received a payment of million plus accrued interest receivable 
the proceeds from settlement are being amortized as a partial offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the notes  lowering the effective interest rate on these borrowings to 
in october  our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of its common stock 
the repurchased shares are to be added to the company s treasury shares and will effectively offset a portion of the company s near term requirements for its stock option and other benefit plans 
under this program  we purchased approximately million shares of our 
table of contents stock during at a total cost of million 
a similar program was authorized in late  and during  we purchased million shares of our stock at a total cost of million and  shares during at a cost of million 
during  we exercised our option and redeemed all of the outstanding shares of convertible subordinated notes  originally issued in and the shares were redeemed at original issue price plus accrued interest  totaling million 
our net cash used in financing activities consisted mainly of long and short term debt payments of million to pay off borrowings under our domestic credit facility that accumulated during the fourth quarter of  mainly to support the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes in the prior year 
these payments were partially offset by proceeds received in from the issuance of million in senior subordinated notes as discussed above 
we continually review our financing options 
although we currently anticipate that we will finance our operations  expansion and other activities through cash on hand  funds generated from operations  equipment leases and funds available under our credit facilities  we will continue to consider alternative financing as appropriate for market conditions 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period dollars in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations 
long term debt obligations include our million senior notes  our million senior subordinated notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  excluding any related discount 
amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of december  for the revolving credit facility 
approximately yen  or million at december   due under our revolving credit facility has been classified according to its scheduled maturity on april   however  we may refinance this borrowing under a future credit facility 

the present values of these obligations  are included on our consolidated balance sheets 
see note g of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our capital lease obligations 

our operating lease obligations are described in note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

purchase obligations include agreements for goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms 
as of december   such obligations include television advertising  a sports facility naming right and other sports sponsorship commitments  telephone services  and software licenses and maintenance contracts for information technology 

our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes million classified as deferred income taxes and other long term liabilities 
this caption consists primarily of our net long term deferred income taxes  the unfunded portion of the guilbert pension plans  and liabilities under our deferred compensation plans 
these liabilities have been excluded from the above table as the timing and or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain 
see note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred tax positions and note j for a discussion of our employee benefit plans  including the guilbert pension plans and the deferred compensation plan 
in addition to the above  we have letters of credit totaling million outstanding at the end of the year  and we have recourse for private label credit card receivables transferred to a third party 
we record a fair value estimate for losses on these receivables in our financial statements 
the total outstanding amount transferred to a third party at the end of the year was approximately million 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates 
some accounting policies 
table of contents have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have also identified certain accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and we have provided below additional information on those policies 
vendor arrangements at the beginning of each year  the company enters into purchase arrangements with its vendors 
generally  our product costs per unit decline as higher volumes of purchases are reached 
often  our vendor agreements require the company to pay higher per unit costs prior to reaching a predetermined milestone  at which time the vendor rebates the per unit differential 
we value inventories and cost of goods sold at the cost paid to the vendor  net of any anticipated rebates 
if the anticipated volume of purchases is not reached  or we believe it is not likely to be reached  cost of goods sold and the remaining inventory balances are adjusted 
the company reviews sales projections and related purchases against vendor program income estimates on a regular basis and adjusts these balances accordingly 
additionally  we receive payments from vendors for activities that lower the cost of product shipment 
such receipts are recognized as a reduction of our cost of goods sold 
while income is recognized throughout the year based on judgment and estimates  the final amounts due from vendors are generally known soon after year end 
substantially all vendor program receivables outstanding at the end of the year are collected within the three months immediately following year end 
we also have arrangements with our vendors where we are reimbursed for a portion of the costs of advertising a vendor s product 
prior to  these arrangements reduced advertising expense for the period 
effective at the beginning of  such cooperative arrangements are treated in the same manner as vendor rebates and reduce the costs of our inventory 
advertising is a component of store and warehouse operating and selling expenses 
see note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of adopting eitf while agreements reached with vendors generally cover at least one year  vendor program and cooperative advertising arrangements can change between years 
these arrangements can be influenced by increases or reductions in inventory purchases compared to company plans and programs offered by the vendors 
while there are long standing volume and pricing conventions in the office products business  such program arrangements are regularly renegotiated  and as such  are subject to change 
if these vendor program arrangements were materially less beneficial  we could either increase the selling price of the vendor s product  which may impact sales volume  or experience a decline in profitability 
inventory valuation our selling model is predicated on the breadth and availability of our product assortment  and our profitability is dependent on high inventory turnover rates 
our merchants monitor inventory on hand by location  particularly as it relates to trailing and projected sales trends 
once a product has been flagged for discontinuance  we record a charge to reduce the product cost to our assessment of the lower of cost or market 
this assessment is based on the quality of the merchandise  the rate of sale  and our assessment of the market conditions 
additional cost adjustments and sales markdowns will be taken as considered appropriate until the product is sold or otherwise disposed 
estimates and judgments are required in determining what items to stock and at what level  and what items to discontinue and how to value them prior to sale 
goodwill testing under accounting rules that became effective at the beginning of fiscal  goodwill is no longer amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment 
our testing consists of comparing the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units to their carrying amounts  including recorded goodwill 
we estimate the fair values of each of our reporting units by discounting their projected cash flows 
our projections are based on the budget for the succeeding year and multi year forecasts 
developing these future cash flow projections requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates regarding sales  gross margin and operating expenses of our reporting units  as well as assumed economic conditions 
since adoption of these accounting rules  our fair value determination has exceeded reporting unit carrying values in all cases 
should future results or economic events cause a change in our projected cash flows  or should our operating plans or business model change  future determinations of fair value may not support the carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units  and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable 
any such write down would be included in operating expenses of the business unit 
closed store reserves and asset impairments the company assesses the performance of each retail store against historic patterns and projects future profitability on a regular basis 
these assessments are based on management s estimates for sales growth  gross margin attainments  and cash flow generation 
if as a result of these evaluations management determines that a store will not achieve certain targets  the decision may be made to close the store 
at the end of  for example  the company decided to close under performing stores following a comprehensive business review and has closed additional stores in the following years 
when the 
table of contents decision is made to close a store  and the store is no longer used for operating purposes  we recognize a liability for remaining costs related to the property  reduced by an estimate of any sublease income 
the calculation of this liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the remaining term on the lease including vacancy period  anticipated sublease income  and costs associated with vacating the premises 
with assistance from independent third parties  we review these judgments and estimates and adjust the liability accordingly 
in  as a result of a detailed portfolio review and changes in commercial real estate markets where we have lease commitments  we increased our liability for closed stores by million 
a similar adjustment of million was made in future fluctuations in the economy and the market place demand for commercial properties can result in material changes in the liability  which can result in a material charge 
costs associated with facility closures are included in store and warehouse operating expenses 
in addition to the decision whether or not to close a store  store assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability of their carrying amounts 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates of future store generated cash flows 
new stores may require two or more years to develop a customer base necessary to achieve expected cash flows 
if the anticipated cash flows of a store cannot support the carrying amount of the store s assets  an impairment charge is recorded to operations as a component of operating and selling expenses 
to the extent that management s estimates of future performance are not realized  future assessments could result in material impairment charges 
income taxes income tax accounting requires management to make estimates and apply judgments to events that will be recognized in one period under rules that apply to financial reporting and in a different period in the company s tax returns 
in particular  judgment is required when estimating the value of future tax deductions  tax credits  and net operating loss carryforwards nols  as represented by deferred tax assets 
some tax credits and nols may expire before they can be utilized and certain deductions by jurisdiction may not meet the recognition standard 
accordingly  to the extent that we believe the recovery of all or a portion of a deferred tax asset is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
generally  changes in judgments that increase or decrease these valuation allowances impact the effective tax rate  and therefore current earnings 
with the acquisition of guilbert  our deferred tax assets increased  primarily from their nols  though virtually all have been offset by valuation allowances because of the uncertainty of their realization 
should we be able to realize a tax benefit from these deferred tax assets  the benefit would reduce goodwill  rather than affect current earnings 
in addition to judgments associated with valuation accounts  our current effective tax provision is based on estimates of our mix of income between domestic and international sources that may be taxed at different rates 
changes in valuation reserves discussed above can impact the effective tax rate  as well as resolution of tax matters at amounts other than what we estimated 
we regularly monitor our current and deferred tax positions and reflect our best estimates of events that have an uncertain outcome 
significant trends  developments and uncertainties over the years  we have seen continued development and growth of competitors in all segments of our business 
in particular  mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs have increased their assortment of home office merchandise  attracting additional back to school customers and year round casual shoppers 
we also face competition from other office supply superstores that compete directly with us in numerous markets 
this competition is likely to result in increased competitive pressures on pricing  product selection and services provided 
many of these retail competitors  including discounters  warehouse clubs  and even drug stores and grocery chains  carry at least limited numbers of basic office supply products  including ink jet and toner cartridges  printer paper and other basic supplies 
some of them have also begun to feature technology products 
many of them price these offerings lower than we do  but they have not shown an indication of greatly expanding their somewhat limited product offerings at this time 
this trend towards a proliferation of retailers offering a limited assortment of office products is a potentially serious trend in our industry  and one that our management is watching closely 
we have also seen growth in new and innovative competitors that offer office products over the internet  featuring special purchase incentives and one time deals such as close outs 
through our own successful internet and business to business web sites  we believe that we have positioned ourselves competitively in the e commerce arena 
another trend in our industry has been consolidation  as two major competitors in the superstores channel and the copy print channel have been or are in the process of being acquired and consolidated into larger  well capitalized corporate conglomerates 
this trend towards consolidation  coupled with acquisitions by financially strong organizations  is potentially a significant trend in our industry 

table of contents market sensitive risks and positions we have market risk exposure related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
we manage the exposure to market risks at the corporate level 
the portfolio of interest sensitive assets and liabilities is monitored and adjusted to provide liquidity necessary to satisfy anticipated short term needs 
the percentage of fixed and variable rate debt is managed to fall within a desired range 
our risk management policies allow the use of specified financial instruments for hedging purposes only  speculation on interest rates or foreign currency rates is not permitted 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on cash equivalents and debt obligations 
the impact on cash and short term investments held at the end of from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would be a decrease in interest income of approximately million in 
table of contents market risk associated with our debt portfolio is summarized below carrying fair risk carrying fair risk dollars in thousands value value sensitivity value value sensitivity million senior subordinated notes million senior notes revolving credit facility including current maturities 
the risk sensitivity of fixed rate debt reflects the estimated increase in fair value from a basis point decrease in interest rates  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
the sensitivity of variable rate debt reflects the possible increase in interest expense during the next period from a basis point change in interest rates prevailing at year end 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to receive fixed and pay floating rates  converting the equivalent of million of this portfolio to variable rate debt through foreign exchange rate risk we conduct business in various countries outside the united states where the functional currency of the country is not the us dollar 
our expansion in europe and our acquisition of guilbert in june has increased the proportion of our operations in countries with euro and british pound functional currencies 
accordingly  we now face a greater risk that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will significantly affect our consolidated financial statements 
the recent weakening of the us dollar compared to other currencies  primarily the euro and british pound  has positively impacted our results by increasing reported sales and operating profit  however  a strengthening of the us dollar will reduce our results 
while we look for opportunities to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation against the us dollar  at this point we have determined not to pursue hedging opportunities generally 
as of december   a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in our operating profit of approximately million 
although operations generally are conducted in the relevant local currency  we are also subject to foreign exchange transaction exposure when our subsidiaries transact business in a currency other than their own functional currency 
this exposure arises primarily from a limited amount of inventory purchases in a foreign currency 
the introduction of the euro and our decision to consolidate our european purchases has greatly reduced these exposures 
at any time during  foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain inventory exposures totaled less than million 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation on our business  we do not believe inflation has a material impact on our sales or the results of our operations 
we consider our business to be only somewhat seasonal  with sales in our north american retail division and business services group slightly higher during the first and third quarters of each year  and sales in our international division slightly higher in the first and fourth quarters 
new accounting standards in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf  application of issue no 
by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers 
generally under this guidance  vendor funded coupons that can be redeemed broadly across companies should be considered revenue  but vendor funded coupons that are unique to a specific retailer should be considered a reduction of the product cost sold 
most retailers  including office depot  have historically recognized both types of arrangements as revenue 
our sales for fiscal years   and include approximately million  million  and million relating to company specific vendor funded coupon arrangements 
beginning in  future vendor funded 
table of contents arrangements will be classified as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r replaces fin and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
the provisions of fin r are effective for the first reporting period that ends after december  for variable interests in those entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities 
application of the provisions of fin r for all other entities is effective for the first reporting period ending after march  we have no interest in any entity considered a special purpose entity  therefore  the initial adoption of fin r did not have an impact on the company 
we believe the adoption of the provisions of fin r in the first quarter of will have no impact on our net earnings  cash flows or financial position 
cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of cautionary statements in december  the private securities litigation reform act of the act was enacted by the united states congress 
the act  as amended  contains certain amendments to the securities act of and the securities exchange act of these amendments provide protection from liability in private lawsuits for forward looking statements made by public companies under certain circumstances  provided that the public company discloses with specificity the risk factors that may impact its future results 
we want to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
in doing so  we have disclosed these forward looking statements by informing you in the following specific cautionary statements of certain circumstances which may cause the information in these statements not to transpire as expected 
this annual report contains both historical information and other information that you can use to infer future performance 
examples of historical information include our annual financial statements and the commentary on past performance contained in our md a 
while we have specifically identified certain information as being forward looking in the context of its presentation  we caution you that  with the exception of information that is clearly historical  all the information contained in this annual report should be considered to be forward looking statements as referred to in the act 
without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence  any time we use the words estimate  project  intend  expect  believe  anticipate  continue and similar expressions  we intend to clearly express that the information deals with possible future events and is forward looking in nature 
certain information in our md a is clearly forward looking in nature  and without limiting the generality of the preceding cautionary statements  we specifically advise you to consider our md a in the light of the cautionary statements set forth herein 
forward looking information involves risks and uncertainties  including certain matters that we discuss in more detail below in this report on form k 
much of the information in this report that looks towards future performance of our company is based on various factors and important assumptions about future events that may or may not actually come true 
as a result  our operations and financial results in the future could differ materially and substantially from those we have discussed in the forward looking statements in this report 
in particular  the factors we discuss below could affect our actual results and could cause our actual results in and in future years to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by us or on our behalf in this report 
we believe that the following risk factors should be considered by persons reading any part of this report on form k  and we hereby expressly qualify this report and future filings with the sec unless and until we modify these cautionary statements in a future filing by the inclusion of these cautionary statements regarding future performance competition retail we compete with a variety of retailers  dealers and distributors in a highly competitive marketplace that includes such competitors as high volume office supply chains so called office supplies superstores  warehouse clubs  computer stores  contract stationers and well established mass merchant retailers 
even grocery and drug store chains have begun to carry at least limited supplies of basic office supplies and technology items  including printer supplies such as ink cartridges and toner cartridges 
while most of these retailers  other than the office supplies superstores  have not yet elected to carry the broad range of skus that our company carries in its various channels of distribution  many of them have elected to carry the most popular and fastest selling items  often selling those limited skus at highly competitive prices relative to the prices at which our company sells its products 
well established mass merchant retailers have the financial and distribution ability to compete very effectively with us should they choose to enter more broadly into the office superstore retail category  internet office supply or contract stationer business or substantially expand their offering in their existing retail outlets 
in addition  there is substantial competition on the internet from other merchants who may or may not have a brick and mortar presence 
there is a possibility that any or all of these competitors could become more aggressive in the future  thereby increasing the number and breadth of our competitors  potentially having a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations 

table of contents competition contract and commercial we compete with a number of contract stationers  mail order and internet operators and retailers who supply office products and services to large and small businesses  both nationally and internationally 
in order to achieve and maintain expected profitability levels  we must continue to grow this segment of our business while maintaining the service levels and aggressive pricing necessary to retain existing customers 
there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to expand our contract and commercial business while retaining our base of existing customers  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
we are also working on various initiatives to improve margin levels in this business segment  but there is no assurance that these initiatives will prove successful 
some of our competitors operate only in the contract and or commercial channels and therefore may be able to focus more attention on the business services segment  thereby providing formidable competition 
our failure to adequately address this segment of our business could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to these competitors 
in addition  we have reached maximum capacity in some of our distribution centers that serve our contract and commercial customers  which may be expected to impede our ability to grow our business in certain areas of our markets 
the economic problems of the past several years have had an adverse impact on a number of our contract and commercial customers  resulting in some cases in cutbacks in expenditures of our existing customers for office supplies and other items we sell to them 
competition consolidation the past year has seen movements to consolidate certain aspects of the competitive landscape  including the entry of new and well funded competitors in certain aspects of our business 
for example  two major common carriers of goods have either completed or are in the process of completing acquisitions of retail outlets that will allow them to compete directly for packaging and shipping business 
this is a material part of our business as well  and presents a new competitive challenge to us 
in addition  two of our major competitors  one in the retail segment and the other in the contract and commercial business  have merged to form a new and potentially more formidable competitive presence  capable of competing in a more unified manner than was the case when these companies were separate entities 
internet as mentioned above  many internet based merchandisers also compete with us 
while this industry segment has somewhat slower growth than in previous years  the remaining competitors in the internet only segment are substantially stronger and better able to compete than was necessarily the case in the past 
the stronger competitors have established strong distribution capabilities and are formidable competitors to the more traditional brick and mortar office supplies superstores 
this competition may increase in the future as the companies which have survived the shakeout in the internet segment continue to expand their operations 
in addition  certain manufacturers of computer hardware  software and peripherals  including certain of our suppliers  have expanded their own direct marketing of products  particularly over the internet 
in addition to selling technology hardware  some of these manufacturers have also begun to expand their offerings to include machine supplies  such as ink and toner 
the number of these direct sellers has increased in recent years 
even as we expand our own internet efforts  our ability to anticipate and adapt to the developing internet marketplace and the capabilities of our network infrastructure to efficiently handle our rapidly expanding operations are of critical importance 
failure to execute well in any of these key areas could have a material adverse effect on our future sales growth and profitability 
execution of expansion plans we plan to open approximately to stores in the united states and canada and to stores in our international division during we consider our retail expansion program to be an integral part of our plans to achieve anticipated operating results in future years 
circumstances outside our control  such as adverse weather conditions affecting construction schedules  unavailability of acceptable sites or materials  labor disputes and similar issues could impact anticipated store openings 
at times in the past  our expansion activities have been hampered by less than optimal selection of real estate locations  resulting in some stores that have failed to meet their planned financial results 
our future expansion plans also include opening retail stores of different sizes generally smaller than our traditional superstore models and using different store formats and layouts 
we cannot determine with certainty whether these newly sized or formatted stores will be successful 
the failure to expand by opening new stores as planned and or the failure to generate the anticipated sales growth in markets where new stores are opened including the opening of new sizes and formats of stores could have a material adverse effect on our future sales growth and profitability 
cannibalization of sales in existing office depot stores as we expand the number of our stores in existing markets  pursuing a fill in strategy that is both offensive and defensive in nature  sales in our existing stores may suffer from cannibalization as customers of our existing stores begin shopping at our new stores 
our new stores typically require an extended period of time to reach the sales and profitability levels of our existing stores 
moreover  the opening of new stores does not ensure that those stores will ever be as profitable as existing stores  particularly when new stores are opened in highly competitive markets or markets in which other office supply superstores may have achieved first mover advantage 
our comparable sales are affected by a number of factors  including the opening of additional office depot stores  the expansion of our contract stationer business in new and existing markets  migration of our customers from the retail channel to other channels  including our own internet sites  commercial and contract channels  competition from other office supply chains  mass merchandisers  warehouse clubs  computer stores  other contract stationers and internet based businesses  and regional  national and international economic conditions 
in addition  our profitability would be adversely affected if our competitors were to attempt to capture market share by reducing prices 
any or all of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated future revenue and profitability models 

table of contents costs of remodeling and re merchandising stores the remodeling and re merchandising of our stores has contributed to increased store expenses  and these costs are expected to continue impacting store expenses throughout and beyond 
while a necessary aspect of maintaining a fresh and appealing image to our customers  the expenses associated with such activities could result in a significant impact on our net income in the future 
in addition  there is no guarantee that these changes will generate any of the benefits that we have anticipated 
furthermore  our growth  through both store openings and acquisitions  will continue to require the expansion and upgrading of our informational  operational and financial systems  as well as necessitate the hiring of new managers at the store and supervisory level 
as mentioned in our md a  we are also experimenting with a new retail format which we call millennium 
we have thus far opened or remodeled stores to the millennium design 
we continue to evaluate the return on our investment in the millennium design  as we seek to reduce the capital and other costs associated with either building or remodeling to the millennium design 
if we are unsuccessful in achieving an acceptable roi on this design  such failure could have a material adverse effect on our future sales growth and profitability 
historical fluctuations in performance fluctuations in our quarterly operating results have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
a variety of factors could contribute to this quarter to quarter variability  including new store openings which require an outlay of pre opening expenses  generate lower initial profit margins and cannibalize existing stores  timing of warehouse integration  competitors pricing  changes in our product mix  fluctuations in advertising and promotional expenses  the effects of seasonality  acquisitions of contract stationers  competitive store openings  an increase in activity by non traditional resellers of office supplies  technology or other products we sell  or other events 
such quarterly fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and or the price of our securities 
international activity we have operations in a number of international markets 
we intend to enter additional international markets as attractive opportunities arise 
each entry could take the form of a start up  acquisition of stock or assets or a joint venture or licensing arrangement 
we have made a decision to accelerate our growth in europe  increasing more rapidly than originally planned the number of countries in which we operate 
in addition to the risks described above in our domestic operations  internationally we face such risks as foreign currency fluctuations  unstable political and economic conditions  and  because some of our foreign operations are not wholly owned  compromised operating control in certain countries 
recent world events have served to underscore even further the risks and uncertainties of operating in other parts of the world 
risks of civil unrest  war and economic crisis in portions of the world outside north america in which we operate represent a more significant factor than may have been the case in the past 
also  we have experienced significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in  including large swings in the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro during the prior year  which affected the sales and earnings in our international division 
our results may continue to be affected by these fluctuations  both positive and negative  in the future as the value of the us dollar changes against other currencies 
all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or our results from operations 
moreover  as we increase the relative percentage of our business that is operated globally  we also increase the impact these factors have on our future operating results 
our startup operation in japan  in particular  has proven to be disappointing to date and has generated losses that have materially affected our financial results in the past and may do so in the future 
because of differing commercial practices  laws and other factors  our ability to use the internet and electronic commerce to substantially increase sales in international locations may not progress at the same rate as in north america 
integration of guilbert in europe in june  we completed the acquisition of guilbert  sa  a leading contract stationer in europe and formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of the ppr group in france 
in addition to the risks associated with making a large investment nearly billion in us dollars at year end exchange rates  we also face a formidable challenge in the integration of the guilbert organization into our european office depot and viking businesses 
we appointed new country managers in nearly every country in which we operate in europe 
some of these managers came from the guilbert organization and some from the office depot viking organization 
failures of any of these managers to adapt to new cultures and the challenges in most cases of managing substantially larger businesses in their respective countries could have a material impact on our results of operations in europe 
in addition to the merger of somewhat different cultures  we also face the challenges of physically integrating facilities from both the former guilbert side of the business and the former office depot viking side of the business 
in many cases  we have duplicate distribution facilities in close proximity to one another 
we must choose wisely which facilities to consolidate  or which ones to emphasize for future growth and expansion 
to the extent that we close or consolidate facilities  we are likely to face high social costs associated with such moves  and the possibility of work stoppages in the form of strikes in some locales in europe 
any or all of these integration issues could have a material impact on our future financial performance and results of operations 
global sourcing of products private label in recent years  we have substantially increased the number and types of products which we sell under our own office depot  viking  guilbert  niceday and other private label brands 
we expect this trend to continue and even accelerate in the future 
we source many of these products from outside the united states  particularly in the far east 
while these products have attractive margins and may enhance our brand image  the increased reliance on foreign sourced products introduces its own set of risks and uncertainties 
sources of supply may prove to be unreliable  or the quality of the globally 
table of contents sourced products may vary from our expectations 
economic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source such products could adversely impact the availability or cost of such products  or both 
moreover  this increased reliance on globally sourced products also subjects our company to other risks  such as the protracted dockworkers strike on the us west coast that adversely impacted imported products for a substantial period of time in moreover  while we seek indemnities from the manufacturers of these products  the uncertainty of realizing on any such indemnity and the lack of understanding of us product liability laws in certain parts of the far east make it more likely that we may have to respond to claims or complaints from our customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products 
for this reason  we have incurred the expense of purchasing separate product liability insurance for sourced products 
the availability and expense of such insurance  while satisfactory to date  may change in the future  making our procurement of foreign sourced products materially less attractive than is the case today 
in addition  while the initial margins on such products is generally more attractive than we can achieve by sourcing from traditional sources of supply  other factors  such as the lack of program dollars  including cooperative advertising contributions  may make such sourcing less attractive in the future 
any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance in the future 
sources and uses of cash we believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents  future operating cash flows  lease financing arrangements and funds available under our credit facilities and term loans should be sufficient to fund our planned expansion  integration and other operating cash needs for at least the next year 
however  there can be no assurance that additional sources of financing will not be required during the next twelve months as a result of unanticipated cash demands  opportunities for expansion  acquisition or investment  changes in growth strategy  changes in our warehouse integration plans or adverse operating results 
we could attempt to meet our financial needs through the capital markets in the form of either equity or debt financing 
alternative financing will be considered if market conditions make it financially attractive 
there can be no assurance that any additional funds required by us  whether within the next twelve months or thereafter  will be available to us on satisfactory terms 
our inability to access needed financial resources could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operating results 
m a activity in  we made a major investment in the growth of our business in europe through the acquisition of guilbert  sa from the ppr group  at a cost of almost billion us dollars at year end exchange rates 
this followed by five years our previous major acquisition of viking in other than these two acquisitions  we have otherwise limited our merger and acquisition activity to relatively small acquisitions 
however  as we seek ways to more aggressively expand and grow our business  it appears more likely that we will increase our interest in m a activity  both domestically and internationally 
while the opportunities from such activity cannot be ignored  neither can the clear reality that many acquisitions do not measure up to the expectations of the acquiring company  for a host of reasons 
m a activity may divert attention of our executive management team away from our existing core businesses 
we may do a less than optimal job of due diligence or evaluation of target companies  and  as always  the task of integrating two substantial businesses can prove daunting 
failure to grow our businesses through m a activity  or failure to execute m a activity in a satisfactory manner  as well as adding substantial leverage to our balance sheet in order to accomplish major acquisitions  could have a significant and material adverse effect on our future business prospects and or our financial performance in the future 
effects of certain charges from time to time in the past  we have recorded charges and credits to adjust past estimates  such as facility closure costs  to reflect current conditions 
there can be no assurance that additional charges of this nature will not be required in the future as well 
in particular  we expect that a retail store chain  such as our retail stores division  should expect to close a certain number of stores each year  while remodeling and or relocating a number of other stores 
we cannot be certain that our decisions to close  remodel and or relocate stores will have the desired favorable results on our financial performance  nor can we anticipate the size and nature of charges associated with such matters 
moreover  an increase in m a activity increases our exposure to having to take such charges  as we learn more about the acquired entity and reach conclusions to consolidate  etc 
that may or may not have been contemplated at the time of acquisition 
such charges  if any  could have a materially adverse impact on our financial position or operating results in the future 
impact of new legislation and new accounting rules since  our company  along with other publicly held companies  has been working diligently to comply with new legislation that has been called the most comprehensive set of reforms of public companies in over a half century  the sarbanes oxley act of soa 
moreover  the implementation of various mandates under soa has resulted in the adoption of a host of new regulations by the securities and exchange commission sec  and  more regulation is anticipated from the newly created public company accounting oversight board 
new regulations may dramatically change the manner in which the company is required to report its results of operations  balance sheet items and other aspects of financial accounting in the future 
in addition  substantial costs have been incurred  and will continue to be incurred to comply with various of these mandates  including the engagement of separate public accounting firms to perform work that is now prohibited to be performed by our regular independent accounting firm  internal costs associated with documenting the adequacy of our internal financial controls and similar compliance activities  and increased costs of audit by our independent accounting firm 

table of contents while office depot believes that it has been at all times in material compliance with laws and regulations pertaining to the proper recording and reporting of our financial results  there can be no assurance that future regulations  implementing soa and otherwise  will not have a material adverse impact on our reported results as compared with prior reporting periods 
certain policy issues  such as the expensing of stock options issued to our employees  could  for example  have a dramatic impact on our reported results of operations  depending upon the outcome of current discussions regarding which  if any  of these policy issues should or will change 
any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our reported financial results 
the financial accounting standards board the fasb has promulgated several new accounting standards and is considering others  some of which could have a material impact on our reported results 
in particular  our company is required to assess the continuing value of goodwill and long lived assets 
this assessment requires judgment and estimates about future cash flows  which may or may not be realized 
changes in facts or assumptions could cause the write down or write off of long lived assets or goodwill associated with various of our operations 
the impact of any required write off of goodwill associated with any units of our company could have a material adverse impact on our reported financial results in future periods 
in summary  while office depot is confident that its past practices and reports filed with the sec  the new york stock exchange and other reports are in material compliance with all laws and regulations  the continued obligation to further enhance disclosures and make filings that increase the transparency of our reported results will undoubtedly add to the overall cost of doing business 
and some of the many proposed changes in accounting policies and principles could dramatically alter the reported results of our company  particularly if we become obligated to expense stock options  as contemplated by at least certain currently pending proposals among various regulatory bodies 
executive management since the appointment of our new chief executive officer in july  we have continued to evolve our management organization to better address the future goals of our company 
in  we filled key positions by adding executive vice presidents in the areas of information technology  merchandising and marketing 
these new senior executives  in turn  have made significant changes in their respective business organizations 
in many cases  new executives have joined our company midway through or even later 
in late  two senior executives left our company our president of bsg and our evp and chief merchandising officer 
we announced a management reorganization in late  including the creation of a new office of president  north america  to whom certain key operating executives in north america would report 
this would dramatically reduce the number of such officers who report directly to our chairman and ceo 
at the same time  we announced promotions of two long time office depot executives to fill key executive positions in direct sales and supply chain  and we also announced searches to fill the positions of president  north america and evp  merchandising 
to date  these positions have not been filled 
such extensive changes in the management structure of our company may be expected to result in numerous changes throughout our management organization  with uncertain outcomes 
there is no assurance that we will necessarily fill these positions with the best persons for the job  or that the executive team will function in a cohesive and effective manner 
as a result  our future operations and results may be materially and adversely affected 
disclaimer of obligation to update we assume no obligation and specifically disclaim any such obligation to update these cautionary statements or any other forward looking statements contained in this annual report to reflect actual results  changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such forward looking statements
