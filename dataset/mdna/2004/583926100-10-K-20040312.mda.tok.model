item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we consider the following to be the most important matters on which management focuses in evaluating our operating performance and financial condition 
revenue growth 
we believe that revenue growth is the key factor affecting our results of operations 
our revenues have historically consisted of royalties and up front licensing fees 
in  we also recognized revenues in connection with sales of our shot safety dental syringe 
our arrangement regarding the sale of the shot safety dental syringe  under which we have contracted for manufacture and distribution of the product  but have not transferred our intellectual property rights  provides greater potential for per unit revenues than would be the case if the product was licensed 
nevertheless  we believe our short term revenue growth will largely be dependent on the efforts of bd in selling products incorporating technology licensed from us 
the extent to which bd commits its resources to the sale of these products is entirely within bd s control 
management has been disappointed with the pace of commercialization of these products in the past  and has encouraged bd to accelerate its efforts 
in this regard  although license revenues from bd have increased  all of such revenues constitute minimum royalties 
however  we are encouraged by bd s launch of the bd vacutainer tm push button collection set in june and the ml version of the integra syringe in february in addition to the growth in sales of the ml integra syringe in management also is focused on increasing revenues by seeking to license additional products that are not currently subject to licenses  by entering into additional collaborative arrangements and possibly by acquiring complimentary businesses 
we rely on our licensees to provide us with sales information in order to calculate the royalties due to us as a result of those sales 
while we have to date relied on this sales information without independent verification  we are currently developing appropriate procedures to verify this information in the future 
liquidity 
we have historically generated cash principally from issuances of equity and up front licensing fees 
although we believe that our cash derived from these sources is sufficient to support ongoing operations for at least the next twelve months  our ultimate success depends on our ability to generate revenues to support operations 
if we cannot generate sufficient revenues to support operations  we will likely have to rely upon debt or equity financing 
there is no assurance we will be able to obtain such financing 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue in was  compared to revenue of  in revenue in reflected the sales of the shot safety dental syringe as well as royalty payments under our licensing agreements  including  in minimum royalty payments from bd and enpath medical  inc revenue in also reflected royalty payments from the sale of our licensed products 
general and administrative expenses were  in  a decrease of  as compared to general and administrative expenses of  in the decrease was primarily due to a reduction of expenditures for employee compensation of approximately  resulting from a reduction in staff  legal expenses of approximately  professional costs of approximately  and stock based compensation of approximately  resulting from the issuance of options  restricted stock grants and warrants  offset by an increase in bad debt expense of  research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  as compared to research and development expenses of  for the corresponding period in the decrease is partially attributable to a  charge recorded in december resulting from the settlement of a claim by our former director of research and development and consulting costs of approximately  in related to the implementation of a quality program required for companies engaged in the manufacture of product 
investment income was  in  an increase of  as compared to  in the corresponding period in the increase was due primarily to an increase of approximately  in invested cash in in  we recorded an impairment charge on our investment in enpath medical inc formerly medamicus of  year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue in was  compared to revenue of  in revenue in consisted of royalty payments from the sale of our licensed products 
revenue in consisted principally of an up front license payment from enpath medical inc formerly medamicus for our license of the safety seldinger introducer needle for use in arterial access 
general and administrative expenses were  in  an increase of  as compared to general and administrative expenses of  in the increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately  in employee compensation related to the hiring of a chief operating officer  additional administrative personnel  legal expenses of approximately  related to the resolution of the royalty rate dispute with bd and professional costs of approximately  research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  as compared to research and development expenses of  for the corresponding period in the increase was primarily due to a charge of  recorded in december resulting from the settlement of a claim by our former director of research and development  an increase in employee compensation cost of approximately  to support research and development  regulatory application costs of approximately  associated with the dental pre filled cartridge injector and costs of approximately  associated with the development of new products 
in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and consistent with the company s accounting policy for marketable equity securities  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the decline in the fair value of its investment in medamicus stocks which was received as part of a development and licensing agreement in was other than temporary 
accordingly  the company established a new basis of  in the investment equivalent to its fair market value at december  as a result  the company realized a loss of  or per basic and diluted common share 
liquidity and capital resources in  our principal sources of cash were the net proceeds of approximately  from our august private placement of common stock  the  of cash generated from our sale of enpath medical inc common stock  licensing fees of  and  from the sale of products 
in  our principal source of cash was the net proceeds of approximately  from our march private placement of common stock 
our primary uses of cash in consisted of general and administrative costs  including cash payments of  for salaries and research and development costs and  to purchase automated equipment and molds necessary for owens illinois to manufacture the shot safety dental cartridge syringe 
general and administrative costs in included cash payments of  for salaries and research and development costs 
at december   we had a revolving line of credit under which we may borrow up to  this facility can be used to fund working capital needs and finance capital equipment purchases 
advances for capital equipment financing may not exceed  and borrowings would be collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
any borrowings to meet working capital needs would bear interest at libor plus  while borrowings to finance capital equipment purchases would bear interest at the prime rate plus 
the facility expires on may   and there is no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating a continuation of the availability of the line of credit or the terms that will be made available to us 
there were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at december  at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of  as compared to  at we believe that we have sufficient funds to support our planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
the availability of resources over a longer term will be dependent on our ability to enter into licensing agreements  the amount of royalty payments we receive from our current and future licensees  our ability to enter into and profitably operate under collaborative arrangements  and our ability to raise additional equity or debt financing 
we have not generated sufficient cash flows from operations to support our operations on an on going basis and anticipate that we may need to seek additional sources of funding in the future 
if we are unsuccessful in negotiating additional agreements  or if licensing revenues are insufficient to support our operations  we may be required to reduce the scope of  or cease  our operations 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  consist of the following payments due by period total less than year years years capital lease obligations   operating lease obligations     total     during  we renewed our lease for office space in ventura  california 
the renewal is for five years beginning november  and terminating october  the base rent of  per month will be increased annually by 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are most significant where they involve levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or matters susceptible to change  and where they can have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance 
we discuss below the more significant estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
patents 
the company capitalizes costs incurred in connection with patent acquisitions  patent applications and patent defenses 
these costs are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the patents  not to exceed the legal life 
the carrying value of the patents are regularly reviewed by management and impairments  if any  are recognized when the expected future cash flows derived from the patent is less than the carrying value 
the estimates of useful lives of the patents and expected future cash flows are based on a number of factors including product demand  market conditions  technology developments and the activities of our competitors 
if future events or evaluations cause management to conclude that the value of one or more patents is impaired  we may recognize significant losses  and our financial condition may be negatively affected  in the future 
available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are reported at a fair value  based on quoted market prices  with the net unrealized gain or loss reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
in determining if a decline in market value below cost for a publicly traded security is other than temporary  we evaluate the relevant market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples and other key measures 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period to the extent of the decline below the carrying value of the investment 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
moreover  if management s evaluation is not correct  we may recognize significant impairment losses in later periods 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
this statement establishes standards for how to classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires the classification of a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability 
this statement is effective for instruments entered into or modified after may  the adoption of this pronouncement will not impact our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of variable interest entities that function to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fin  effective date of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities deferring the effective date for applying the provisions of fin for public entities interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before february  until financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after december  in december  the fasb issued fin revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this revised interpretation is effective for all entities no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  we have no investment in or contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and therefore the adoption of this interpretation will not have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  if we enter into any such arrangement with a variable interest entity in the future or an entity with which we have a relationship is reconsidered based on guidance in the revised interpretation to be a variable interest entity  our consolidated financial position or results of operations might be impacted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit at december  if we were to borrow under our credit facility  borrowings to meet working capital needs would bear interest at libor plus and borrowings to finance capital equipment purchases would bear interest at the prime rate plus 
as a result  any such borrowings would be subject to interest rate fluctuations which could increase our interest expense  respectively 
we invest a portion of excess cash in marketable securities in accordance with our investment guidelines as approved by our board of directors 
these investments are in highly liquid  low risk securities where our risk of loss is at a minimum
