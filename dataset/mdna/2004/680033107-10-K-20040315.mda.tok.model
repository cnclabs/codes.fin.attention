item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the net income of old national decreased significantly compared to previous years 
old national was negatively affected by considerable credit quality issues during  resulting in substantially increased provisions for loan losses 
in addition  a reserve for the settlement of pending litigation resulted in million of additional expenses for the year 
weak loan demand in the markets served by old national as well as low interest rates negatively affected the net interest margin 
as a result of management s balance sheet strategies  old national s financial condition showed a decrease in assets and liabilities at december   reflecting heavy refinancing of residential real estate loans during the year  a reduction in the investment portfolio  and a reduction of certificates of deposits and borrowed funds 
management uses various indicators such as return on assets  return on equity and asset quality ratios in order to evaluate the performance of the business 
these are discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
financial basis the following discussion is an analysis of old national s results of operations for the years ended december  through  and financial condition as of december  and this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with old national s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements concerning old national s business that are based on estimates and involves certain risks and uncertainties 
therefore  future results could differ significantly from management s current expectations and the related forward looking statements 
see item  business for further information regarding forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures found elsewhere in the annual report  are based upon old national s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires old national to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights and the valuation of goodwill and intangibles 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
o allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the consolidated loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans  assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the portfolio and historical loss experience 
the allowance represents management s best estimate  but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance in the near future 
likewise  an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required reserve 
in either instance  unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations 
the allowance is increased through a provision charged to operating expense 
uncollectible loans are charged off through the allowance 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added to the allowance 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that contractual interest and principal payments will not be collected either for the amounts or by the dates as scheduled in the loan agreement 
old national s policy for recognizing income on impaired loans is to accrue interest unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
o mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights are recognized as separate assets when loans are sold with servicing retained 
the total price of loans sold is allocated between the loans sold and the mortgage servicing rights retained based on the relative fair values of each 
the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights is estimated by calculating the present value of estimated future net servicing income derived from related cash flows 
amortization of capitalized mortgage servicing rights is determined in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
impairment of mortgage servicing rights exists if the book value of the mortgage servicing rights exceed its estimated fair value 
in determining impairment  mortgage servicing rights are stratified by interest rates 
critical assumptions used in determining fair value include expected mortgage loan prepayment rates  discount rates and other economic factors  which are determined based on current market conditions 
the expected rates of mortgage loan prepayments are the most significant factors driving the value of mortgage servicing rights 
increases in expected mortgage loan prepayments reduce estimated future net servicing cash flows because the life of the underlying loan is reduced 
fair values  using estimated mortgage loan prepayment rates  are derived from a third party statistical model 
negative adjustments to the value  if any  are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges against mortgage servicing income 
the use of a valuation allowance enables the recovery of this value as market conditions become more favorable 
o goodwill and intangibles 
effective january   old national adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
discontinued amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived assets 
intangible assets with a determinable useful life continue to be amortized over that period 
for purchase acquisitions  old national is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition  inflation  asset growth rates or other relevant factors 
in addition  the determination of the useful lives for which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived assets recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible with subsequent reversal of the impairment loss being prohibited 
the tests for impairment fair values are based on internal valuations using management s assumptions of future growth rates  future attrition  discount rates  multiples of earnings or other relevant factors 
the resulting estimated fair values could have a significant impact on the carrying values of goodwill or intangibles and could result in impairment losses affecting the financials of the company as a whole and the individual lines of business in which the goodwill or intangibles reside 
management believes the accounting estimates related to the allowance for loan losses  the capitalization  amortization and valuations of mortgage servicing rights  and the valuation of goodwill and intangibles are critical accounting estimates because the estimates are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require company management to make assumptions concerning  among other factors  the changes in the types and volumes of the portfolios  rates of future prepayments  valuation assumptions and anticipated economic conditions  and the impact of recognizing an impairment or loan loss could have a material effect on old national s assets reported on the balance sheet as well as net income 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis 
non gaap financial measures in january  the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s historical or future performance  financial position or cash flow that excludes or includes amounts or adjustments that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
regulation g requires companies that present non gaap financial measures to disclose a numerical reconciliation to the most directly comparable measurement using gaap as well as the reason why the non gaap measure is an important measure 
management does not believe it has used any non gaap financial measures in this annual report on form k 
acquisition  consolidation and divestiture activity during and  old national acquired various financial services companies 
these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
these key acquisitions in the asset management consulting and insurance agency operations enhanced the growth of the non bank services segment  also referred to as the old national signature group  and expanded old national into its targeted metropolitan markets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the various acquisitions 
during the third quarter of  old national finalized branch sales in markets no longer considered consistent with the company s strategy resulting in a pre tax gain of million and an after tax gain of million 
the branch sales resulted in a decrease in total loans of million and total deposits of million 
during  old national completed its one bank consolidation project that started in with the merger of its remaining banking charters into one bank 
the goals of one bank included a single brand image  common products offered throughout the banking locations and improved back office efficiency 
in the second quarter of  old national further streamlined its regional banking administrative structure and incurred after tax expenses of million in the consolidation of acquisitions made in results of operations earnings summary in  old national generated million of net income and net income per share compared to million and  respectively in the earnings included an million  or per share  after tax gain on branch sales 
old national s return on average assets was and return on average shareholders equity was for the year  which decreased significantly from ratios of and  respectively 
the most significant impact on net income in was the provision for loan losses of million  an increase of million over the million recorded in  resulting from significant deterioration in credit quality 
other significant factors negatively affecting net income included weak commercial loan demand  deterioration of the net interest margin from declining interest rates  and a charge of million pre tax  or million after tax  to establish a reserve related to litigation settlements 
during  old national recognized million of gains on the sales of investment securities compared to million recognized in in addition  record origination volumes in mortgage operations and acquisitions in the non bank services segment had a positive impact on earnings results 
business line results old national is managed in three primary business segments 
table summarizes old national s business line results for the years ended december business line results table dollars in thousands community banking    non bank services    treasury    other    consolidated net income    the community banking segment profit decreased million from increases in noninterest income of million over  were offset by the increased provision for loan losses of million and decreases in net interest income of million 
net interest income suffered from the refinancing of residential real estate loans  with many of the new loans being sold into the secondary market  and weak commercial and commercial real estate loan demand in the regions served by old national 
noninterest income for increased primarily due to the increased mortgage banking activity during the current year 
noninterest expense increased million  or primarily due to outside processing expenses related to the third party subcontracting of the servicing functions of old national s mortgage banking activities 
the non bank services segment profit increased million from primarily due to acquisitions of several insurance agencies and an asset management company over the past year and a half 
these acquisitions increased noninterest income by million and noninterest expense by million over the treasury segment showed very little change in as compared to  as the net securities gains increase of million in compared to  was offset by an million decrease in net interest income for this segment 
treasury s net interest income included income derived from the company s interest rate risk position that was negatively impacted by declining interest rates during most of the other segment profit included gains or charges which management chose not to allocate to the various segments 
other for included expenses to record the litigation reserve of million and included the gain of million related to the sales of branches 
net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowed funds  was the most significant component of old national s earnings  comprising over of old national s revenues 
net interest income and net interest margin in the following discussion is presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis  which adjusts tax exempt or nontaxable interest income to an amount that would be comparable to interest subject to income taxes using the federal statutory tax rate in effect of for all periods 
net income is unaffected by these taxable equivalent adjustments 
net interest income included taxable equivalent adjustments of million for and million for net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors  primarily the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources and the interest rate fluctuations 
other factors include accelerated prepayments of mortgage related assets and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities 
funding from customer deposits generally cost less than wholesale funding sources 
factors  such as general economic activity  federal reserve board monetary policy and price volatility of competing alternative investments  can also exert significant influence on old national s ability to optimize its mix of assets and funding and its net interest income and margin 
taxable equivalent net interest income was million in  a decrease from the million reported in the net interest margin was for  compared to reported for average earning assets grew million  which primarily consisted of increased investment securities of million net of decreased loans of million  while the yield on average earning assets declined basis points from to 
much of the asset growth was funded by interest bearing liabilities that increased million or  and the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined only basis points from to 
noninterest bearing deposits provided an additional million in funding and other liabilities and equity increased million 
the decline in interest rates was the primary factor contributing to lower net interest income and net interest margin in the target federal funds rate  the rate that dictates national prime rate and determines many other short term loan and liability rates  declined in june to and was unchanged through the remainder of the year 
market driven interest rates  as evidenced by the five year united states treasury note yield  decreased during before rebounding by the end of the five year treasury note yield fell from in january to in may before increasing to by december the decrease in interest rates during had a significant impact on the mix and yield of earning assets 
driven by lower rates  many of the company s residential real estate loans were refinanced in  with the new loan production being sold into the secondary loan market  shrinking the residential loan portfolio 
additionally  commercial and commercial real estate loans did not grow appreciably during the year  a result of both continued weak loan demand in our markets and more stringent loan underwriting standards 
the decline in loans shifted much of the company s asset growth to investment securities  a lower yielding asset class compared to loans 
in addition  many of the company s investment securities matured  prepaid or were sold in because of lower rates and were replaced by lower yielding securities

the provision for loan losses was million for  a significant increase from the million recorded in refer to allowance for loan losses and asset quality section for further discussion of non performing loans  charge offs and additional items impacting the provision 
noninterest income old national generates revenues in the form of noninterest income through fees and sales commissions from its core banking franchise and other related businesses  such as trust and asset management  investment products and insurance 
this source of revenue has grown as a percentage of total revenue to in compared to in  which has been beneficial during this downward turn in net interest income 
old national will continue to focus on noninterest income revenue streams while carefully managing balance sheet risk positions to ensure that old national is well positioned for the anticipated turnaround in market conditions 
noninterest income for was million  an increase of million  or over the million reported for in  old national realized million of gains on the sales of investment securities in comparison to million for the same period of investment securities transactions are considered as part of the continuing management of the balance sheet to address interest rate and yield curve shifts

deposit related fees and service charges were million in compared to million for  an increase of million  or

in the banking industry  the efficiency ratio  which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income  is often used to measure expense levels 
the efficiency ratio decreases when revenue is greater in relation to expenses and increases when revenue is lesser in relation to expenses 
a decreasing efficiency ratio represents positive trends and improved efficiency 
the efficiency ratio increased to in from in  representing a negative trend 
a company wide program  ascend  has been initiated as discussed in item  business  which is designed to be an intense evaluation of every aspect of operations for expense reductions and revenue growth ideas 
as a result of this program  old national expects to have significant improvements in efficiency by the end of the implementation phase in noninterest expense for totaled million  an increase of million  or over the million recorded in salaries and benefits  the largest component of noninterest expense  totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of million  of which million directly related to acquisitions

financial condition overview old national s assets at december   were billion  a decrease compared to billion recorded at december  investments and loans decreased million and million  respectively  and total liabilities declined million compared to december  total shareholders equity decreased million from year end earning assets old national s earning assets are comprised of loans and loans held for sale  investment securities and money market investments 
earning assets were billion at december   a decrease of from december  during the first half of  investment securities increased as a temporary source of earning assets 
during the second half of  old national reduced its investment portfolio due to fewer attractive investment opportunities and the company s need to reduce its sensitivity to rising interest rates 
despite the continued weakness in commercial lending and the specific sales of million of nonaccrual commercial and residential real estate loans  total loans decreased only slightly as these factors were partially offset by consumer loan growth 
investment securities old national classifies investment securities primarily as available for sale to give management the flexibility to sell the securities prior to maturity if needed  based on fluctuating interest rates or changes in the company s funding requirements 
however  old national added and year fixed rate mortgage pass through securities to its held to maturity investment portfolio during at december   the investment securities portfolio was billion compared to billion at december   a decrease of 
investment securities represented of earning assets at december   compared to at december  during and the first half of  old national increased the investment portfolio as a short term alternative source of earning assets to offset declining residential real estate and minimal commercial and consumer loan growth 
during the second half of  old national began decreasing the size of the investment portfolio and used the cash flows generated by the declining investment portfolio to reduce borrowed funds 
stronger economic activity and stronger commercial loan demand would likely result in increased investments in loans and the investment portfolio would stabilize or decrease 
continued weak commercial loan demand  however  may cause old national to use cash flows to reinvest in securities 
investment securities available for sale portfolio had net unrealized gains of million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease was a result of higher market interest rates and a smaller portfolio of securities available for sale at december   compared to december  also  old national realized pre tax gains on sales of securities from this portfolio of million during the investment portfolio had an average life of years at december   compared to years at december  the average yields on available for sale investment securities  on a taxable equivalent basis  were in and in the average yield on the held to maturity portfolio was in at december   old national had a concentration of investment securities issued by certain states and their political subdivisions with the following aggregate market values million by indiana  which represented of shareholders equity  and million by illinois  which represented of shareholders equity 
at december   the aggregate market values of the concentration of certain states and their political subdivisions were million by indiana  which represents of shareholders equity  and million by illinois  which represents of shareholders equity 
there were no other concentrations of investment securities issued by an individual state and its political subdivisions that were greater than of shareholders equity 
residential loans held for sale residential loans held for sale were million at december   compared to million at december  residential loans held for sale are loans that are closed  but not yet sold on the secondary market 
the amount of residential loans held for sale on the balance sheet varies depending on the timing of movement of originations and loan sales to the secondary market 
at december   loan originations were down compared to december   primarily due to an upturn in interest rates at the end of lending and loan administration old national s credit culture has historically featured decision making near the customer with corporate oversight 
in  due to continued credit quality concerns  old national implemented certain credit approval disciplines in order to continue to focus on the reduction of problem and non performing loans in the portfolio  including a restructuring of the manner in which commercial loans are analyzed and approved 
community based loan personnel  which now include independent underwriting and analytic support staff  continue to have the authority to extend credit under guidelines established and administered by old national s credit policy committee 
this committee  which meets quarterly  includes members from both the holding company and the bank 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  problem loans and charge offs and regularly reviews the loan policy to assure it remains appropriate for the current lending environment 
old national lends primarily to small and medium sized commercial and commercial real estate customers in various industries including manufacturing  agribusiness  transportation  mining  wholesaling and retailing 
as measured by old national  the company had no concentration of loans in any single industry exceeding of its portfolio and has no exposure to foreign borrowers or lesser developed countries 
old national s policy is to concentrate its lending activity in the geographic market areas it serves  primarily indiana  illinois  kentucky and tennessee  with a focus on increasing its presence in the metropolitan markets  including indianapolis  louisville and st 
louis 
old national has been affected by weakness in the economy of its principal markets  particularly in its home state of indiana  which has resulted in minimal growth of commercial and consumer loans and tighter credit underwriting standards 
old national anticipates that when the economy in old national s principal markets begins to improve  commercial and consumer loans will begin to show higher levels of growth 
in the past four years  commercial loans average growth rate was per year while commercial real estate grew per year 
residential real estate loans declined per year while consumer loans rose annually over the same period

a write down of million was recorded against the allowance for loan losses related to these sales 
consumer loans  including automobile loans  personal and home equity loans and lines of credit  and student loans  increased million or at december   compared to december   primarily due to a renewed focus on consumer lending

old national sells the majority of residential real estate loans originated as a strategy to better manage interest rate risk and liquidity 
these loans are sold with loan servicing retained in order to maintain customer relationships and generate noninterest income and fees 
by using this strategy  old national is able to recognize an immediate gain in noninterest income versus a small net interest income spread over a longer period of time 
old national sells the majority of the residential real estate loans without recourse  currently having less than of loans sold with recourse 
during  residential real estate loans continued to liquidate at extraordinary levels in the low interest rate environment and the related boom in refinancing 
as of december   residential real estate loans were million  a decrease of million or from december  old national s residential real estate loan portfolio was also affected by the sales of delinquent loans in these sales were to improve credit quality and reduce the level of non performing loans and are not a part of old national s ongoing strategy 
delinquent residential real estate loans of million were sold to independent investors resulting in write downs of million recorded against the allowance for loan losses 
during  old national developed additional mortgage products that fit within the company s interest rate risk profile that will be retained by the bank 
as a result of this strategy  old national would expect to see a stabilization of residential real estate loans on the consolidated balance sheet 
allowance for loan losses and asset quality administration old national monitors the quality of its loan portfolio on an on going basis and uses a combination of detailed credit assessments by relationship managers and credit officers  historic loss trends  and economic and business environment factors in determining its allowance for loan losses 
old national records provisions for loan losses based on current and projected loans outstanding  grade changes  mix of loans and expected losses 
a detailed loan loss evaluation on an individual loan basis for the company s highest risk loans is performed quarterly 
management follows the progress of the economy and how the continuing slow recovery might affect old national s borrowers in both the near and the intermediate term 
old national has a formalized and disciplined independent loan review program 
its loan review system evaluates loan administration  credit quality and compliance with corporate loan standards 
this program includes periodic reviews conducted at the community bank locations as well as regular reviews of problem loan reports  delinquencies and charge offs 
each month  problem loan reports are prepared and reviewed  which include borrowers that show indications of being unable to meet debt obligations in the normal course of business  and loans which have other characteristics deemed by bank management to warrant special attention or have been criticized by regulators in the examination process 
classified loans include non performing loans  past due days and other problem loans while criticized loans  also known as special mention loans  are loans that have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention and require specific quarterly reviews by the bank 
assets determined by the various evaluation processes to be under performing receive special attention by old national management 
under performing assets consist of nonaccrual loans where the ultimate collectibility of interest or principal is uncertain  loans renegotiated in some manner  primarily to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal payments because the borrower s financial condition deteriorated  loans with principal or interest past due ninety days or more  and foreclosed properties 
a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest become days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest 
when loans are classified as nonaccrual  interest accrued during the year is reversed against earnings  interest accrued in the prior year  if any  is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
cash received while a loan is classified as nonaccrual is recorded to principal 
adjustments to the allowance for loan losses are made as deemed necessary for probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
while an estimate of future losses is  by its very nature  difficult to precisely predict  management of old national believes that the methodology that it uses in determining an appropriate reserve for future losses is reasonable 
loan officers grade the larger commercial and commercial real estate loans in the portfolio periodically as determined by loan policy requirements or determined by specific guidelines based on loan characteristics as set by management and banking regulation 
periodically  these loan grades are reviewed independently by the loan review department 
for impaired loans  an assessment is conducted as to whether there is likely loss in the event of default 
if such a loss is determined to be likely  the loss is quantified and a specific reserve is assigned to the loan 
for the balance of the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio  loan grade migration projections coupled with historic loss experience within the respective grades is used to develop reserve requirement ranges based on expected future losses 
a loan is considered impaired under sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  an amendment of fasb statement no 
and when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
an impaired loan does not include larger groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  loans that are measured at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value  leases and debt securities 
during the third quarter of  old national revised its interpretation of impaired loans to strictly follow sfas no 
previous to this change  old national s interpretation of impaired loans more conservatively included all problem credits with a potential collateral deficiency in the event of default and nonaccrual loans in larger groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans 
had old national made this in the prior year  impaired loans would have totaled million rather than million as reported at december  at december   the total impaired loans were million of which million had an allocated reserve of million and million had no specific reserve recorded 
historic loss ratios adjusted for future expectations of economic conditions are used in determining the appropriate level of reserves for consumer and residential real estate loans 
the methodology used by old national to predict losses on loans that are not impaired uses a system of allocating losses back to the original time the respective loans were booked and then moving those losses through the different loan grades as the loans migrate to higher risk classifications 
allowance for loan losses and asset quality at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  an increase of million compared to million at december  as a percentage of total loans held for investment  the allowance increased to at december   from at december  during  the provision for loan losses amounted to million  an increase of million over various factors led to old national s higher provision in first  the amount necessary to cover the higher than normal losses in was significant 
second  loan collateral values in the markets served by old national deteriorated which led to the need for higher reserves in the event of liquidation 
third  recent experience elevated the rate of expected future losses 
the increase in the allowance for loan losses for commercial and commercial real estate loans accounted for virtually all of the increase in the total reserve from december   to december  for commercial and commercial real estate loans  the reserve as a percentage of that portfolio increased to at december   from at december  while the absolute level of classified and criticized loans at december   decreased from december   bank management believed this level was appropriate given continued economic weakness and stresses in the midwestern region on commercial borrowers 
as a result  the reserve for commercial and commercial real estate loans increased by million 
the reserve for residential real estate loans as a percentage of that portfolio increased to at december   from at december  this increase reflected an increase in historical loss rates due to higher residential real estate loan charge offs during  including the losses resulting from the sales of non performing residential real estate loans 
the reserve for consumer loans increased only slightly and the reserve as a percentage of loans in this portfolio was unchanged from december   to december  at of the portfolio 
this was reflective of little or no change in the performance and loss experience on the consumer loan portfolio

under performing assets at year end totaled million in and million in as a percent of total loans and foreclosed properties  under performing assets at december were for and for in  the nonaccrual category of under performing loans was million  an increase of million since december  this increase and the lower net loan balance at december   were significant contributors to the higher ratio of under performing assets to total loans and foreclosed properties 
in a review of industry standards during and in discussions with regulators  the company strengthened its internal policies in regards to nonaccrual loans 
also  in order to reduce the negative impact on earnings from high levels of nonaccrual loans  old national sold million of non performing loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses to under performing assets ratio stood at compared to at december  management believes that it has appropriately identified and reserved for loan losses related to nonaccrual loans at december  a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal or interest 
approximately million of nonaccrual loans less than thirty days delinquent were still contractually performing at december  management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of non performing loans and may consider the possibility of additional sales of troubled and non performing loans  which could result in additional write downs to the allowance for loan losses 
management expects that trends in nonaccrual loans will be influenced by the degree to which the economy strengthens 
old national operates in the midwest  primarily in the state of indiana  which has been particularly negatively impacted by the weakness in the manufacturing segment of the economy 
the longer the significant softness in manufacturing continues  the more stress it puts on old national s borrowers  increasing the potential for additional nonaccrual loans 
interest income of approximately million in and million in would have been recorded on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans if such loans had been accruing interest throughout the year in accordance with their original terms 
the amount of interest income actually recorded on nonaccrual and restructured loans was million in and million in old national had no renegotiated loans at december  and  however  in  old national had renegotiated loans of million from two borrowers whose loan payment schedules were modified to reduce their cash flow requirements while obtaining additional collateral and or guarantees and shortening the loan term

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management inherent in old national s balance sheet is market risk  defined as the sensitivity of income  fair market values and capital to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and other relevant market rates or prices 
the primary market risk to which old national has exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk arises because assets and liabilities may reprice  mature or prepay at different times or based upon different indices as market interest rates change 
changes in the slope of the yield curve and the pace of changes in interest rates may also impact net interest income and the fair value of the balance sheet 
old national manages interest rate risk within an overall asset and liability management framework that includes attention to credit risk  liquidity risk and capitalization 
a principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates 
asset and liability management activity is governed by a policy reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors has delegated the oversight of the administration of this policy to the funds management committee  a committee of the board of directors  which meets quarterly 
in addition  a second oversight committee  the balance sheet management committee comprised of senior executive managers  provides guidance for the execution of the activities 
old national uses two modeling techniques to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on the company  net interest income at risk and market value of equity 
net interest income at risk is used by management and the board of directors to evaluate the impact of changing rates over a two year horizon while market value of equity is more useful for long term interest rate risk 
these models simulate the likely behavior of the company s net interest income and the likely change in the company s market value due to changes in interest rates under possible interest rate scenarios 
because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates impact the company s net interest income and value  old national recognizes that model outputs are not guarantees for actual results 
for this reason  old national models many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to best understand its overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes 
old national s board of directors  through its funds management committee  monitors the company s interest rate risk 
the funds management committee establishes policy guidelines for the allowable change in cumulative net interest income over a two year period and the change in market value of equity in an up or down basis point instantaneous parallel change to the yield curve basis point yield curve shock 
the current guidelines for net interest income at risk is of net interest income over a two year period in a basis point shock to the yield curve 
as of december   old national projects that in a basis point shock to interest rates  net interest income would be down cumulative over the next two years 
in a basis point shock to interest rates  old national projects net interest income would be down cumulative over the next two years 
the current guidelines for the allowable fluctuation in market value of equity are in a basis point shock to the yield curve 
as of december   old national projects market value of equity to decrease by in a basis point shock to interest rates and to decrease by in a basis point shock 
at december   old national was slightly outside its policy of net interest income at risk in a basis point interest rate shock 
the significant steepening of the yield curve during the second half of and its impact on the duration of the company s investment portfolio and the growth of money market and interest bearing checking accounts during the year contributed to the change in the company s interest rate risk profile from december old national continues to lengthen the repricing of its deposits and wholesale funding  and shorten the repricing of its asset portfolios to bring the interest rate risk position back within the policy guideline 
estimated month estimated change cumulative impact on in market net interest income at risk value of equity interest rate change basis points policy actual policy actual at december   old national s most likely interest rate scenario was one in which interest rates gradually increase during the next months 
many factors can impact the interest rate outlook and it is possible that the company s interest rate outlook could change 
the net interest income model scenario that most closely matches the company s current outlook was a basis point upward shift in the yield curve quarterly for four quarters  then flat rates for the following four quarters basis point ramp 
the estimated month cumulative impact on net interest income was down in this scenario 
given that balance sheet assumptions and interest rate forecasts in the model are inherently uncertain  the company views the rate risk position as virtually neutral in this scenario 
old national uses derivatives to manage interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments 
these transactions serve to better balance the repricing of assets and liabilities in various rate change scenarios and protect the company from changes in interest rates 
liquidity management the funds management committee of the board of directors and the balance sheet management committee establish liquidity risk guidelines and monitor liquidity risk 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure old national has the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and cost effective manner 
management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities  funding sources  and loan and deposit forecasts to minimize funding risk 
the company maintains strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth  properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements 
old national s ability to raise funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies views of the company s credit quality  liquidity  capital and earnings 
the senior debt ratings of old national bancorp and old national bank at december   are shown in the following table 
senior debt ratings standard and poor s moody s investor services fitch  inc long term short term long term short term long term short term old national bancorp bbb n a baa n a bbb f old national bank bbb a a p bbb f n a not applicable standard poor s rating services lowered its long term ratings on old national bancorp and old national bank from bbb to bbb and a to bbb  respectively  during the outlook was revised to stable

as of december   old national bank had the capacity to borrow million from the federal reserve bank s discount window 
old national bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb of indianapolis  which provides a source of funding through fhlb advances 
old national also maintains relationships in capital markets with brokers and dealers to issue certificates of deposits and short term and medium term bank notes 
in addition  at december   old national had million available for issuance under a billion global bank note program for senior and subordinated debt 
old national bancorp  the parent company  has routine funding requirements consisting primarily of operating expenses  dividends to shareholders  debt service  net derivative cash flows and funds used for acquisitions 
old national bancorp obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends and management fees collected from its subsidiaries and the issuance of debt securities 
at december   the parent company s other borrowings outstanding was million  compared with million at december  the increase in other borrowings in was driven by the issuance of million of fixed rate medium term notes and the reclassification of million related to guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in subordinated debentures  which was partially offset by medium term note maturities of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the reclassification 
old national bancorp s debt scheduled to mature in the next months is million 
these debt obligations are expected to be met through current cash balances and dividends from subsidiaries 
federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval 
for further information regarding dividend restrictions  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   old national had an sec shelf registration in place for the issuance of million preferred securities by a series of trusts
