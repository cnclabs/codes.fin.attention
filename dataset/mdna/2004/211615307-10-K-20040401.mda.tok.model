item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations references to a note are to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report company overview the company operates primarily in two industry segments  the heating and air conditioning segment and the construction materials segment 
the primary products manufactured by the heating and air conditioning segment are gas fired wall furnaces  console heaters  evaporative coolers and fan coils 
gas fired wall furnaces  console heaters and fan coil products are manufactured at williams furnace co  headquartered in colton  california 
evaporative coolers are manufactured at phoenix manufacturing  inc  headquartered in phoenix  arizona 
the primary products of the construction materials segment are ready mix concrete  construction aggregates  building supplies and doors which are offered by transit mix concrete co 
and castle concrete company in colorado springs  colorado and transit mix of pueblo  inc and mckinney door and hardware  inc 
mdhi in pueblo  colorado 
currently  rocky mountain ready mix concrete  inc rmrm of denver  colorado  only offers ready mix concrete 
heating and air conditioning segment furnace and console heater sales volume in was modestly lower than the prior year s level  however margins improved  rising slightly from the prior year 
fan coil sales deteriorated to a level not experienced since the depressed commercial construction market was the primary cause for the falloff 
hotel construction has been particularly hard hit  reflecting the overall depressed state of the travel and leisure industry 
evaporative cooler sales volume grew largely due to expanded sales to a large retail customer during the year 
hot  dry weather that persisted later in the year than normal fueled the demand at the consumer level 
wholesale trade remained static 
margins registered slight improvement reflecting the increased volume 
selling  general and administrative costs were closely monitored and reduced where possible 
these savings  however  were largely offset by unusually high legal costs related to product liability claims and a suit filed to ensure the continued supply of a key purchased component for our evaporative cooler product line 
cash flow from this segment approximated earnings 
depreciation exceeded capital expenditures  however  this was offset by an increase in furnace inventories from an all time low level at the end of construction materials segment despite their proximity  denver  colorado springs and pueblo have distinct competitive and economic conditions 
concrete sales volumes declined in all three markets compared to last year 
the per yard price of concrete reflected the diversity of the three markets 
while pueblo prices remained fairly constant  colorado springs prices declined over and denver s prices fell over 
the average pricing in denver would have suffered more but for the effect of fixed priced contracts in the opening backlog of rmrm 
the sales volume of construction aggregates increased modestly from the level  however  gross profits declined 
the learning curve on the two new aggregates plants  one at the colorado springs sand operation and the other on the east side of pueblo  was longer than we expected 
progress was made during the year  though  and costs were reduced 
the door and supply divisions  together with mdhi  experienced the same drop in sales reflecting the construction slump 
sales for this group increased slightly only because of the inclusion of mdhi for the full year compared to the nine months included in after the april purchase of mdhi 
profit margins were steady for the door products but declined for building supplies largely due to very competitive price bidding for reinforced steel bar rebar projects 
the construction materials segment typically requires large capital investments  particularly when volume is strong 
reflecting the more modest demand  capital spending in was held to approximately  as the new batch plant in brighton  colorado was brought online and a new maintenance facility in pueblo was built to complement the move of mining and ready mix concrete batching to the east side of pueblo 
other expenditures were primarily routine replacements and upgrades 
cash flow surpassed earnings 
depreciation and amortization exceeded capital expenditures  however  an increase in receivables consumed cash 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were  at the end of compared to  at the prior year end 
operations in provided  of cash compared to  in and  generated in the decrease in net cash generated by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the decreased earnings 
net working capital increased by  in compared to an increase of only  in the decrease in net cash generated by operating activities in compared to was chiefly due to the decreased earnings 
increases in the company s working capital needs also consumed approximately  during compared to providing approximately  of cash during net cash used in investing activities was  in   in and  in capital expenditures for  and were   and  respectively 
the capital expenditures in included the construction of a maintenance facility in pueblo and completion of the brighton batch plant begun in the expenditures in included the completion of three large projects that were begun in a new state of the art sand processing plant was completed in colorado springs during the third quarter  a new aggregate processing plant in pueblo was completed in june and a new central mix batch plant was added in colorado springs 
in addition  a new batch plant was purchased to replace the existing facility in brighton  colorado 
as noted above  the new plant became operational in during  work was performed on the aforementioned projects and the company also invested approximately  for a new office building in colton 
on april    was expended to purchase mckinney door and hardware  inc mdhi 
during fiscal year   was used to purchase rocky mountain ready mix concrete  inc rmrm on december  budgeted capital expenditures for are approximately  including  for the construction materials segment and  for the heating and air conditioning segment  which is approximately  less than planned depreciation 
the expenditures are primarily for routine replacement and upgrades 
the company expects that the expenditures will be funded from existing cash balances and operating cash flow 
during  cash of  was used in financing activities 
scheduled long term debt payments of  were made during the year including  against capital lease obligations

during  cash of  was provided by financing activities 
the company increased its term debt by  for the acquisition of rmrm 
scheduled long term debt repayments of  were made during the year including  against capital lease obligations 
cash of  was used to acquire  shares of treasury stock partially offset by proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options 
capital resources  obligations and commitments  and off balance sheet arrangements revolving credit and term loan agreement the company signed a new revolving credit and term loan agreement the credit agreement with two banks in september the agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of  and a term loan facility in the original amount of  both facilities are unsecured and bear interest at prime or a performance based libor rate 
the term loan is payable in escalating quarterly installments with final payment of all then unpaid principal on june  at january    was outstanding on the term loan while there was no balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is available for seasonal needs including the funding of seasonal sales programs related to the furnace and evaporative cooler product lines 
the line is also used for stand by letters of credit to insurance carriers in support of self insured amounts under the company s risk management program 
currently such performance based rate is libor plus for the term loan and libor plus for borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
effective december   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement swap in order to fix the floating interest rate characteristic of most of the company s term loan borrowings 
the company s current interest rate under the swap is 
such rate is subject to adjustment depending upon the company s performance 
the company concluded that it was appropriate to take advantage of the interest rate environment and fix the interest rate at a relatively low level for a five year period 
obligations and commitments the following tables represent our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments  such as debt guarantees  as of january  payments due by period as of january  amounts in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years after years total long term debt see note capital lease obligations see note operating leases see note minimum royalty agreement see note total contractual obligations amounts of commitment expiration per period as of january  amounts in thousands other commercial commitments less than year years years after years total standby letters of credit we believe that existing cash balances and anticipated cash flow  supplemented by seasonal borrowings against the revolving line of credit  will be sufficient to cover expected cash needs  including servicing debt and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements that would be likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
operations fiscal vs 
consolidated sales in declined  or  to  sales declined  in the construction materials segment 
the reduced level of construction activity along the front range in colorado led to lower volumes and increased price competition resulting in lower ready mix concrete prices  most notably in the denver metropolitan area 
the reduced volume combined with the lower prices account for the diminished sales level 
sales in the heating and air conditioning segment decreased  
a sharp decline in fan coil sales was only partially offset by improved evaporative cooler sales 
fan coil sales continue to reflect the nationwide slump in commercial construction  particularly hotel construction 
the improved evaporative cooler sales were primarily driven by hot  dry weather that persisted later in the year than normal 
the company experienced a high level of price competition in all of its product lines during  especially in the denver ready mix concrete market 
the company does not expect any appreciable change in market conditions in denver during during  inflation was not a significant factor at any of the operations except that employee health care costs and general business insurance premiums again dramatically outpaced the rate of inflation 
in addition  producers of flat rolled steel products  key raw materials in our heating and air conditioning products  recently announced significant nationwide price increases 
phoenix manufacturing has sufficient steel inventory to cover cooler production for the remainder of the current cooling season 
our steel suppliers will honor quoted prices on orders already placed 
however  it can be expected that prices on future steel orders will be substantially higher 
williams furnace will incur a small surcharge for april and may deliveries of steel before paying the increased prices beginning in june 
while we would seek to increase the selling price of our products to recover the higher steel costs  there is no assurance that we would be able to do so due to the competitive conditions in our particular markets 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  depletion and amortization  as a percent of sales  decreased from to 
the improvement realized in the heating and air conditioning segment was primarily due to a  write down in of inventories and other costs associated with a product manufactured at our phoenix plant 
a very slight improvement was experienced in the construction materials segment due to the inclusion of mdhi for the full year in the further decline in construction activity along the front range in colorado had the effect of increasing price competition resulting in lower prices for ready mix concrete 
the effect of lower concrete prices on profit margins was largely offset by lower costs and operating improvement at the various aggregates locations 
selling and administrative expenses increased in despite the decline in sales 
the increase was due to higher legal costs related to product liability claims and a dispute with a supplier concerning the continued availability of a key purchased component for our evaporative cooler product line 
the decline in operating income from  to  is primarily due to the decreased sales  the heightened competition in colorado and the aforementioned increased legal costs 
other income increased  as a result of  of gain realized on the settlement of property tax bills related to the oracle ridge mining partners property 
in addition  was realized during from the sale of a not exploitable aggregate property in colorado 
the company s effective income tax rate reflects federal and state statutory rates adjusted for non deductible and other tax items 
the effective rate in was reduced by due to earned california enterprise zone credits that will benefit future tax years 
see note operations fiscal vs 
consolidated sales in declined  or  to  excluding the sales of mdhi  acquired on april   the sales decline would have been approximately 
the sales of the construction materials segment declined  while sales of the heating and air conditioning segment increased   compared to the previous year 
the reduction in the construction materials segment was across the three main markets in colorado as construction continued to decline along the front range of colorado 
the modest increase in the heating and air conditioning segment was the result of strong evaporative cooler sales and slightly improved furnace sales offset by reduced sales of fan coils 
the increase in evaporative cooler sales was primarily due to the addition of a large new retail customer 
fan coil sales declined reflecting the nationwide slump in commercial construction  notably hotel construction 
the company experienced a high level of price competition throughout both and in all of its product lines 
inflation was not a significant factor at any of the operations during either or  except that employee health care costs and general business insurance premiums dramatically outpaced the rate of inflation for the period 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  depletion and amortization  as a percent of sales  increased from to 
the increase was primarily experienced in the construction materials segment 
the declining construction activity along the front range in colorado had the effect of increasing price competition resulting in lower prices per yard 
some of the aggregates operations experienced increased costs as well 
higher costs were incurred in the pueblo gravel operation as a now depleted gravel site was closed and start up costs at the new site exceeded expectations 
in addition  initial yields of primary products at the new pueblo gravel site were less than that experienced at the company s other gravel operations 
additional costs were also incurred in dismantling the old aggregates plant 
finally  a plant breakdown at one of the aggregates operations during the first quarter of and a brief shut down prior to bringing the new sand plant on line in colorado springs added to the increased costs 
the increase in the heating and air conditioning segment is due to a change in product mix and the  write down of inventories and other costs associated with a product manufactured at our phoenix plant 
selling and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at  as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses increased slightly to 
the decline in operating income from  to  is primarily due to the decreased sales  the heightened competition in colorado  the aforementioned increased costs at three of the construction aggregate operations and the inventory write down 
the  decrease in other income is primarily the result of  of gains realized on sales of depleted or not exploitable aggregate properties in colorado during compared to  of gains on sales during the company s effective income tax rate reflects federal and state statutory rates adjusted for non deductible and other tax items 
the lower effective rate in was due to the benefit of california enterprise zone credits as discussed below 
also see note related party transactions the company purchases insurance coverage for workers compensation  general and product liability together with another company controlled by the company s principal shareholders to minimize insurance costs and to obtain other more favorable terms 
allocation of the expense of the program is either provided by the underwriter or based upon a formula that considers  among other things  sales levels  loss exposure and claim experience 
claims under the self insured portion of the policies are charged directly to the incurring party 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 issued by the securities and exchange commission  requires all registrants  including the company  to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies and methods 
inventories inventories are priced at the lower of cost at january  at last in  first out  with the remainder at first in  first out or market 
inventories are reviewed annually for excess or obsolete stock with a provision recorded  where appropriate 
intangibles goodwill was amortized using a year life through the year 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized as a charge to earnings 
as a result of this new standard  amortization expense was reduced by approximately  in and we annually assess goodwill for potential impairment 
this assessment requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  discount rates  and growth rates 
no impairment was indicated in the current year 
if the assessment had indicated that the carrying value of goodwill was impaired  an impairment charge would have been recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its fair value 
management believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable  however  changes in different assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimated fair value 
liabilities the company purchases insurance coverage for workers compensation  general product and automobile liability  retaining certain levels of risk self insured portion 
provision for workers compensation and automobile claims is estimated based upon information provided by the company s independent claims administrator and the company s own experience 
with regard to product liability  provisions for both claims and unasserted claims that would be covered under the self insured portion of the policies are recorded in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and are reviewed at least annually for revisions in estimates 
the company records a reserve for future reclamation work to be performed at its various aggregate operations based upon estimates of the recoverable quantities of rock and sand available in each location combined with an estimate of the total expense that will be incurred to reclaim a property 
provision is made based upon the units of production method 
actual reclamation costs are charged against the reserve 
the adequacy of the recorded reserve is assessed annually 
estimates of both the quantities of recoverable material and the cost of reclamation are periodically updated by an independent professional 
in a similar manner  depletion of rock and sand deposits and amortization of deferred development costs are computed by the units of production method based upon estimated recoverable quantities of rock and sand 
sales the company recognizes revenue as products are shipped to customers 
the amount is recorded net of applicable provisions for discounts  volume incentives  returns and allowances 
at the time of revenue recognition  the company also provides an estimate of potential bad debt and warranty expense as well as an amount anticipated to be granted to customers under cooperative advertising programs based upon current program terms and historical experience 
recently issued accounting standards the recently issued accounting pronouncement section of note discusses new accounting policies adopted by us during and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted
