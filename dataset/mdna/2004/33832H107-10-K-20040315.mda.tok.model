the bank is a full service  retail oriented bank primarily engaged in retail banking  small business  residential and commercial real estate lending and mortgage banking 
the following discussion focuses on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of flag during the three years ended december  this discussion and the financial information contained herein are presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the financial condition  results of operations and future prospects of flag and should be read as a supplement to and in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
changes in flag s operating performance and balance sheet accelerated during  leading to significant improvement in three primary areas earnings  balance sheet growth and credit quality 
earnings flag recorded record earnings in of million 
this level of operating performance has numerous contributing factors  the most notable being margin growth  increases in non interest income and operating expense control 
net interest income improved from million in to million in despite a less favorable interest rate environment in compared to the previous year 
flag focused on reducing borrowing costs during the year by moving its funding focus to demand de posits interest bearing and non interest bearing from the historically more expensive time deposits 
in addition  efforts in developing reliable commercial lending relationships in metropolitan atlanta succeeded  contributing to a improvement in earning assets from to non interest income also improved significantly from million in to million in this increase is principally due to the refinancing opportunities that the low interest rate environment provided for homeowners and flag s ability to attract these mortgage loan opportunities through its mortgage division  flag mortgage 
revenues from our mortgage division increased to million during recurring operating expenses  exclusive of million in restructuring charges taken in  increased only slightly in over levels  despite strong growth in the balance sheet and non interest income 
for the fourth quarter of  these operating expenses were less than higher than for the same quarter in this control of operating expenses is a result of management s determination to continue to leverage its operating systems  banking locations and workforce 
balance sheet growth flag s total assets grew by approximately million in or 
gross loans outstanding improved by approximately million as the company succeeded in developing its correspondent lending line of business and accelerating its commercial lending activities in metropolitan atlanta 
demand deposits interest bearin g and non interest bearing improved by million or during this increase is due principally to flag s capitalization on the branch acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of by offering an aggressive approach toward attracting commercial deposits in metropolitan atlanta 
credit quality improvement in credit quality was significant as well 
non performing assets to total assets improved to at the end of compared to at the end of past due and classified loan trends were significantly better than in previous years as well 
the improving credit quality at flag is due largely to a comprehensive loan review program as well as efforts that focus loan production efforts in areas management believes provide higher quality credits 
recent developments during the fourth quarter of  flag signed a letter of intent to sell its thomaston  georgia branch and expects to complete the sale in the first quarter of included in the sale are the loans and deposits of the branch which totaled million and million  respectively  at december  effective november   the bank acquired six branches located in metropolitan atlanta from encore bank

critical accounting policies the accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practices within the banking industry 
in connection with the application of those principles  we have made judgments  estimates and assumptions which  in the case of the determining our allowance for loan losses all  have been critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations 
management assesses the adequacy of the all regularly during the year  and formally prior to the end of each calendar quarter 
this assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance 
this estimation process can affect our estimated loan loss expense for a given period 
generally  the allowance for loan losses increases as the outstanding balance of loans or the level of classified or impaired loans increases 
loans or portions of loans that are deemed uncollectible are charged against and reduce the allowance 
the allowance is replenished by means of a provision for loan losses that is charged as an expense against income 
as a result  our estimate of the allowance for loan losses affects our earnings directly 
the all consists of two portions allocated amounts representing the potential exposures on specifically identified credits and other exposures readily predictable by historical or comparative experience  and an unallocated amount representative of inherent loss which is not readily identifiable 
even though the all is composed of two components  the entire all is available to absorb any credit losses 
allocated amounts are used on loans where management has determined that there is an increased probability or severity of loss than on the loan portfolio as a whole 
we base the allocation for these unique loans primarily on risk rating grades assigned to each of these loans as a result of our loan management and review processes 
we then assign each risk rating grade a loss ratio  whic h is determined based on the experience of management  discussions with banking regulators and our independent loan review process 
we estimate losses on impaired loans based on estimated cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or based on the underlying collateral value 
to the extent that management does not believe that a certain loan s risk is appropriately represented by the risk rating grades  a specific review of the credit is performed which would result in a less subjective allocation for that particular loan 
unallocated amounts are particularly subjective and do not lend themselves to exact mathematical calculation 
the unallocated amount represents estimated inherent credit losses which may exist  but have not yet been identified  as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating the unallocated amount  such matters as changes in the local or national economy  the depth or experience in the lending staff  any concentrations of credit in any particular industry group  and new banking laws or regulations 
after we assess applicable factors  we evaluate the aggregate unallocated amount based on our management s experience 
we then test the resulting all balance by comparing the balance in the all to historical trends and peer information 
our management then evaluates the result of the procedures perfor med  including the result of our testing  and concludes on the appropriateness of the balance of the all in its entirety 
the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the assessment prior to the filing of quarterly and annual financial information 
in assessing the adequacy of the all  we also rely on an ongoing independent loan review process 
we undertake this process both to ascertain whether there are loans in the portfolio whose credit quality has weakened over time and to assist in our overall evaluation of the risk characteristics of the entire loan portfolio 
our loan review process includes the judgment of management  the input from our independent loan reviewer  and reviews that may have been conducted by bank regulatory agencies as part of their usual examination process 
see provision and allowance for loan losses for additional information 
results of operations flag recorded record earnings in of  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss in of  or per diluted share and net income in of  or per diluted share 
flag s net loss in resulted primarily from the  after tax charge taken in the first quarter to effect its management restructuring  the loss on the early repayment of federal home loan bank fhlb advances  and a larger than normal addition to the provision for loan losses 
flag recorded after tax extraordinary items related to the early repayment of fhlb advances totaling  and  in and  respectively 
net interest income net interest income the difference or spread between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on borrowed funds is the largest component of flag s operating income 
flag manages net interest income in a manner that realizes the largest spread while accepting certain levels of credit  liquidity and interest rate risks 
managing these risks requires systems and processes to identify and evaluate these risks at various levels in the organization 
net interest income was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
flag s change in net interest income during was primarily the result of an increase in average earning assets in of over amounts  coupled with a successful effort on reducing borrowing costs 
flag s net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets decreased in to from in and in net interest margin in was negatively impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment 
flag s strategy in was centered towards increasing net interest income by growing earning assets  improving the allocation of earning assets and by reducing borrowing costs both from customer deposits and wholesale borrowings 
the growth strategy employed in contributed lower incremental margins than what flag has historically managed due to the current interest rate environment 
management is satisfied with the incremental margins on the growth in earning assets 
total interest income in was million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
yields on average earning assets in decreased to compared to and in and  respectively 
the lower interest rate environment and flag s allocation of earning assets were significant contributors to lower yields on earning assets 
flag maintained larger than normal amounts of short term investments federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits in other banks and investments with maturities under days in anticipation of the loan growth that was experienced in the last half of short term investments averaged approximately of earning assets in compared to only in and in at december   sho rt term investments as a percentage of total earning assets had been reduced to 
investment securities averaged approximately million during this compares to averages of million for and million for as a percentage of average earning assets  investment securities decreased to from in and in the decrease in yields on investment securities  as well as their decreasing allocation of earning assets  is a result of the management s strategy to maintain shorter term investments than flag has historically managed to provide the necessary funds for its loan growth needs 
in management s opinion  yields on investment opportunities during would not have adequately compensated us for the price and interest rate risks posed 
these yields resulted in a higher concentration of earning assets in federal fu nds sold and interest bearing deposits in other banks during average loans outstanding including mortgage loans held for sale increased in to million over million for and million for as a percentage of earning assets  loans outstanding averaged approximately during  a slight improvement over the averaged in at december   flag s loans outstanding including mortgage loans held for sale totaled million  representing of earning assets 
total interest expense in decreased  to million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
aggressive repricing of deposit accounts  accompanied by early repayment and refinancing of fhlb debt  has allowed flag to significantly reduce interest expense over the time frame discussed 
flag s cost of funds also decreased substantially  from and in and  to in interest expense on demand deposits money market and interest bearing checking accounts increased to million during from million in while the cost of these deposits fell slightly to 
this cost for compares to in the increase in interest expense on demand deposits related mostly to a increase in average balances in  but was more than offset by decreases in interest expense on time deposits

major sources of non interest income considered to be non recurring are the sales of branches and bank locations 
service charges on deposit accounts decreased only slightly in to million from million and million in and  respectively 
while flag had strong growth in deposits during  most of the growth came from higher balance money market and interest checking balances where customers carry balances sufficient to qualify for reduced or eliminated fees 
service charges in decreased approximately  from million in  due mostly to the sale of approximately million in deposits in december of mortgage banking activities include origination fees  service release premiums and the gain on the sale of mortgage loans originated solely for the purpose of being sold 
the lower interest rate environment  coupled with more effective originators  helped flag improve the income from its mortgage banking activities in to million  an increase of million over income from mortgage banking activities in increased approximately  over also due to a falling interest rate environment 
flag continued to streamline banking locations and operations during this effort resulted in the closure of its sandy springs office that was under lease  the relocation of the company s primary operations facility to a smaller and better designed location in jonesboro  georgia  and the sale and leaseback of its dunwoody location 
these decisions resulted in a combined pretax gain of approximately  effective december   flag sold selected loans  deposits and property of its branches in milan and mcrae  georgia and recognized a gain on sale of approximately million 
non interest expenses salary and employee benefits for were million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in and increase in relates largely to the management restructuring undertaken in the first quarter of  in which flag took a charge related to buyouts of employment contracts and severance pay of approximately million 
excluding these charges taken in the first quarter of  flag s salary and benefits increased only  or in over the amount 
this relatively small increase in total salary and benefits comes despite an increase in total assets of in total full time equivalent employees were  and at december    and  respectively 
occupancy expense for was million  decreasing slightly from million in and million in the downward trend reflects a successful strategy to consolidate branches and operating locations during the past four years 
this effort has resulted in offices being closed or sold since the beginning of professional fees decreased substantially in to  from million in and million in professional fees in included costs related to the management restructuring and the private placement effected in the first quarter whereas the higher balances in relate to expenses associated with branch sales 
communications and data expense increased in to million from million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in relates mostly to the company s decision to outsource both its data processing and the warehousing of most networking equipment during other operating expenses decreased in to million from million in and million in larger amounts of other operating expenses in and relate to the divestiture and or closing of branches not included in occupancy expense and expenses relating to the management restructuring and private placement that are not reported in salary and benefits or professional fees 
investment securities the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects management s strategy of maintaining an appropriate combination of liquidity  interest rate risk and yield 
flag seeks to maintain an investment portfolio with minimal credit risk  investing mostly in obligations of the united states treasury or other state and federal governmental agencies 
investment securities decreased to million at december  from million at december  at december   all investment securities outstanding were classified as available for sale 
refinancing opportunities available to homeowners in caused unusually fast prepayments in mortgage backed securities  resulting in a million decrease to million at december  flag concentrated the reinvestment of these mortgage prepayments into mostly us treasury and government agency securities with shorter maturities  resulting in an increase of million to million at december  at december   gross unrealized gains in the total portfolio amounted to million and gross unrealized losses amounted to  table reflects the carrying amount of the investment securities portfolio for the past three years

flag concentrates its lending activities in several areas that management believes provides adequate diversification with acceptable yield and risk levels 
these areas include  but are not limited  to construction  commercial real estate  agricultural and correspondent lending lending services to other community banks

an allowance for possible losses is provided through charges to flag s earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million in  million in  and million in flag s decrease in the provision for loan losses reflects improving credit quality with lower levels of non performing assets 
the larger provision in was needed to replenish the allowance for loan losses due to the higher than normal amount of net charge offs experienced 
the provis ion for loan losses in included approximately million for certain large agricultural credits 
management determines the level of the provision for loan losses based on outstanding loan balances  the levels of non performing assets  and reviews of assets classified as substandard  doubtful  or loss and larger credits  together with an analysis of historical loss experience and current economic conditions 
as shown in table  the year end allowance for loan losses decreased to million at december  from million at december  flag evidenced its improving credit quality by a lower level of net chargeoffs for and a smaller provision for loan losses 
net charge offs reached a five year low of million or of average loans outstanding for the year 
these amounts compared to net charge offs of million or for and million or for the allowance for loan losses was of gross loans at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is both adequate and appropriate 
however  the future level of the allowance for loan losses is highly dependent upon loan growth  loan loss experience  and other factors  which cannot be anticipated with a high degree of certainty

deposits and borrowings total deposits increased approximately million during  totaling million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in flag s deposit base in is mostly attributable to the disciplined sales effort on demand deposits in metro atlanta 
demand deposits interest bearing and non interest bearing increased million in to million at december  this successful effort on demand deposits allowed flag to be more profitable with pricing on time deposits 
time deposits decreased million in to million at december  the maturities of time deposits of  or more issued by the bank at december   are summarized in table table maturities of time deposits over  dollars in thousands three months or less over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months at december   the bank was a shareholder in the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb 
through this affiliation  advances totaling million were outstanding at rates competitive with other sources of funding with similar maturities 
management anticipates continued utilization of this short and long term source of funds to minimize interest rate risk and to fund growth in earning assets when profitable to do so 
during  flag repaid million in fixed rate advances from the fhlb prior to their original maturity date  incurring a prepayment penalty totaling approximately  in  flag repaid approximately million in advances with prepayment penalties totaling approximately million 
these advances were repaid in both years due to a falling interest rate environment in which flag could obtain new borrowings at significantly lower rates

flag maintains relationships with correspondent banks that can provide funds on short notice 
as of december   flag has arrangements with a commercial bank for short term unsecured advances up to  asset liability management the primary objective of flag s asset and liability management program is to control exposure to interest rate risk the exposure to changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates so as to enhance its earnings and protect its net worth against potential loss resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
historically  the average term to maturity or repricing rate changes of assets primarily loans and investment securities has exceeded the average repricing period of liabilities primarily deposits and borrowings

as presented in this table  at december   the liabilities subject to rate changes within one year excee ded flag s assets subject to rate changes within one year 
flag s primary source of funding has been demand deposits interest bearing and non interest bearing instead of time deposits and wholesale borrowings with longer maturities 
this method of funding earning assets has issues concerning interest rate risk  liquidity and profitability  all of which were contemplated and measured by the company 
flag concluded that this strategy is the most profitable method of funding growth in earning assets of the company for the foreseeable future and has committed significant sales  marketing and training resources at being successful in this effort 
where interest rate risk is concerned  flag considered factors such as account size  relationship strength and historical rate levels needed to remain competitive 
generally speaking  it is the opinion of management that these deposits are less sensitive to rate movements than the earning assets they are funding 
flag uses an interest rate simulation model th at uses management assumptions and theories regarding rate movements and the impact each movement will have on individual components of the balance sheet 
this approach  believed to produce more accurate results than the approach summarized in the following table  indicates that flag s balance sheet is  in fact  asset sensitive  meaning a rising rate environment would have a positive impact on flag s net interest income 
management carefully measures and monitors interest rate sensitivity and believes that its operating strategies offer protection against interest rate risk 
as required by various regulatory authorities  flag s board of directors has established an interest rate risk policy  which sets specific limits on interest rate risk exposure 
adherence to this policy is reviewed by flag s executive committee and presented at least annually to the board of directors

while the desired level of liquidity will vary depending upon a variety of factors  it is the primary goal of flag to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in all expected economic environments 
liquidity is defined as the ability of a bank to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining flag s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of the bank s customers  both depositors and borrowers 
the primary objectives of asset liability management are to provide for adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of customers and to maintain an optimal balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  so that flag can also meet the investment requirements of its shareholders as market interest rates change 
daily monitoring of the sources and use of funds is necessary to maintain a position that meets both requirements 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments and the maturities and sales of securities 
mortgage loans held for sale totaled million at december   and typically turn over every days as the closed loans are sold to investors in the secondary market 
real estate construction and commercial loans that mature in one year or less amounted to million  or of the total loan portfolio at december  other short term investments such as federal funds sold are additional sources of liquidity 
the liability section of the balance sheet provides liquidity through depositors interest bearing and non interest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  other borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are additional sources of liquidity and represent flag s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet other short term liquidity needs 
as disclosed in flag s consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements  net cash provided by operating activities was million during the major sources of cash by operating activities were the changes in mortgage loans held for sale and net earnings 
net cash used by investing activities was million and consisted primarily of an increase in net loans and the purchase of investment securities available for sale  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities available for sale 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  and consisted mostly of the net change in deposits and the increase in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements

reference should be made to the consolidated statements of cash flows appearing in the consolidated financial statements for the three year analysis of the changes in cash and cash equivalents resulting from operating  investing and financing activities 
off balance sheet arrangements flag is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expir ation dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
a commitment involves  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets 
flag s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the instrument is represented by the contractual notional amount of the instrument 
since certain commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
flag uses the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit as they do for on balance sheet instruments 
collateral held for commitments to extend credit varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant  equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
the following table summarizes flag s off balance sheet financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk as of december  commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit capital resources and dividends stockholders equity at december  increased to million from million at december  this increase is largely due to the net earnings of the company of approximately million less approximately million in dividends to shareholders 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia requires federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action with regard to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
as a result of fdicia  the federal banking agencies introduced an additional capital measure called the tier risk based capital ratio 
the tier ratio is the ratio of core capital to risk adjusted total assets

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does the effect of inflation 
the liquidity and maturity structures of flag s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the financial accounting standards board and other standard setting entities that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on flag s consolidated financial statements upon adoption
