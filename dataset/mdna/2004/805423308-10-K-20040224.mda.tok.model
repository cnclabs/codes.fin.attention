critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations and financial position 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
valuation of long lived assets management evaluates the recoverability of our long lived assets under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires us to review for impairment our long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
significant factors  which would trigger an impairment review  include the following significant negative industry trends  significant changes in technology  significant underutilization of assets  and significant changes in how assets are used or are planned to be used 
when such an event occurs  management estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
these impairment evaluations involve estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset and the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
management utilizes an expected present value technique  which uses a risk free rate and multiple cash flow scenarios reflecting the range of possible outcomes  to estimate fair value of the asset 
actual useful lives and cash flows could differ from those estimated by management using these techniques  which could have a material affect on our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents there were no asset impairment charges in  however  our restructuring charges totaled million related to a previously vacated facility lease for which we revised our estimated liability to encompass the remaining minimum lease payments throughout the full term of the lease which expires in march during and  we recognized asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively  primarily related to equipment with carrying value above its estimated fair market value 
intangibles management accounts for the commercial customer contracts acquired in the wam net transaction in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the commercial customer contracts acquired are valued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as an asset purchase at an amount which reflects the allocation of the estimated purchase price which will be finalized in april based on their estimated fair value relative to the estimated fair value of the other assets received  plus the incremental direct costs incurred in effecting the transaction 
based on our evaluation of the useful life of the existing customer contracts  probability of renewals and projected cash flows from these customers  the assets are being amortized over a year life 
sfas requires management to evaluate the remaining useful life of the customer contracts each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
if the estimate of the customer contracts remaining useful life changes  the remaining carrying amount is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
actual useful lives could differ from those estimated by management  which could have a material affect on our operating results and financial position 
management also assesses the customer contract intangible assets for impairment losses in accordance with sfas  consistent with the policies discussed above in valuation of long lived assets 
revenue recognition revenues consist primarily of managed ip vpn networks  hosting and internet access service fees  which are fixed monthly amounts  and are recognized in the financial statements when earned over the life of the contract 
installation fee revenue and the associated installation costs are deferred in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
such deferred revenue and costs are recognized into revenue and data communications and operations costs in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight line basis over periods of months  the estimated average life of a customer contract 
for all periods  any services billed and payments received in advance of providing services are deferred until the period such services are earned 
revenues for estimated credits to be issued are recorded as contra revenue based on historical credits issued and known disputes 
amounts paid by reuters in related to the buy down of portions of their minimum revenue commitments have been accounted for as deferred revenue  and will be recognized into revenue over the life of the network services agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer information  we generally do not require customer deposits or collateral 
there is no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss history in future periods 
if a significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of a large customer or group of customers were to occur  it could have a material adverse affect on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
data communication costs in the ordinary course of business  invoices from our communications service providers will exceed the services we have actually taken from them 
our practice is to identify these variances and engage in discussions with the vendors to resolve the differences 
we maintain accruals for our best estimate of the difference between what we have previously paid the vendor and the amount that will ultimately be paid to them 
purchased communications services are our largest cost item 
variations in this accrual may have a material impact on our results of operations 
employee stock options as permitted under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas we account for employee stock options in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  we recognize compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of the equity instrument awarded as determined at the measurement date 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we are required to provide expanded disclosures concerning stock based compensation 
new accounting standards may be promulgated which would require us to expense employee stock options at fair value  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we have provided a full valuation allowance on tax loss carry forwards and other potential tax benefits according to statement of financial accounting standards no

these costs were also reduced by million as a result of reductions in estimated accruals for such costs which we believe are no longer required and million of sales tax refunds related to such costs
