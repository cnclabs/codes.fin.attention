item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations 
these forward looking statements fall within the meaning of the federal securities laws that relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  can  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  intend  potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition and elsewhere in this report 
executive summary overview we are a leader in the application of directed molecular evolution  a process by which genes are modified for specific commercial uses 
maxygen began operations in march with the mission to develop important commercial products through the use of biotechnology 
since then  we have established a focus in human therapeutics  particularly optimized protein pharmaceuticals 
our business model focuses on developing next generation protein pharmaceuticals that address significant markets  on our own or with partners 
we currently have four next generation protein therapeutic leads in pre clinical development 
the four leads address significant opportunities and deficiencies in first generation marketed protein products 
the four product candidates are an optimized alpha interferon for the treatment of hepatitis c  partnered with roche  an optimized gamma interferon  for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other indications  partnered with intermune  and two leads to which we retain all rights first  an optimized beta interferon for multiple sclerosis  and second  an optimized protein for the treatment of myelosuppression 
we also have two industrial subsidiaries 
our wholly owned subsidiary verdia focuses on applying its proprietary technologies to create novel agricultural biotechnology products  specifically crop protection and plant quality traits 
verdia has seven potential products in crop development and testing with its partners and an additional earlier stage potential products in its pipeline 
our majority owned subsidiary codexis focuses on the development of biocatalysis and fermentation processes and products for the pharmaceutical industry 
codexis now has five processes operating at commercial scale  each process generating royalty payments from partners 
codexis also has over potential products and processes in development with partners and in its own research and development pipeline 
to date  we have generated revenues from research collaborations with pharmaceutical  chemical  agriculture and petroleum companies and from government grants 
moving forward  we anticipate establishing additional strategic alliances 
however  as our internal resources and expertise have grown  we have strategically shifted our dependence on collaborative partner funding to advance our products and business to an increased focus on internal product development for greater potential future value capture 
we believe that this is an important step in building long term value in the company 
consistent with this strategic shift  revenue from strategic alliances and government grants increased from million in to million in  and decreased to in we anticipate that our revenue from strategic alliances and government grants will continue to decrease in to between million and million 
we continue to maintain a strong cash position in which to fund our expanded internal product development with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million as of december  of this amount  million is held by codexis and verdia for investment in their respective businesses  leaving a balance of approximately million for our therapeutics business 

table of contents we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have invested heavily in establishing our proprietary technologies 
these investments contributed to the increases in our research and development expenses from million in to million in our research and development expenses decreased in to primarily due to reduced headcount as we wound down the funded research terms of our collaborations with lundbeck and intermune 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over at least the next several years 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that require us to make estimates and assumptions see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies  including those that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the amounts of maxygen and our wholly owned subsidiaries  maxygen aps denmark  which was acquired by maxygen in august  maxygen holdings ltd 
cayman islands and verdia  inc  as well as our majority owned subsidiary  codexis  inc 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
our ownership in codexis is approximately  based upon the voting rights of the issued and outstanding shares of codexis common and preferred stock 
based upon management s evaluation of the investors rights under eitf consensus  investor accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority stockholder or stockholders have certain approval or veto rights and paragraph of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  we have included of the net losses of codexis in the determination of our consolidated net loss 
we record minority interest in the consolidated balance sheets to account for the ownership interest of the minority owners 
on september   codexis sold million of codexis preferred stock to investors  of which million was purchased by maxygen and million was purchased by several unrelated investors 
on october   codexis sold an additional million of preferred stock to unrelated investors 
this series of convertible preferred stock included a redemption provision  which provided that the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of this convertible preferred stock excluding the convertible preferred stock held by maxygen and its affiliates  voting together as a separate class  may require codexis to redeem the convertible preferred stock 
the redemption price for each share will be payable in cash in exchange for the shares of convertible preferred stock to be redeemed at a sum equal to the applicable original issue price per share plus five percent of the original issue price per year from the original issue date until the applicable redemption date  plus declared and unpaid dividends 
notice of redemption can be given at any time on or after the fifth anniversary of the original issue date 
in connection with these redemption rights  maxygen has recorded accretion of the redemption premium for the convertible preferred stock  excluding the shares owned by maxygen  in the amount of million for the year ended december  the accretion is recorded as subsidiary preferred stock accretion on the consolidated statement of operations and as a reduction of additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheets 
any obligation to make redemption payments is solely an obligation of codexis and any payments are to be made solely from assets of codexis 
our investment in the joint venture with delta pine and land company called deltamax cotton llc in which we have an equity interest of is being accounted for under the equity method 
our share of the joint venture s loss totaled million in and million in and is recorded  under the equity method of accounting  as equity in net loss of joint venture and minority interests in the consolidated statement of 
table of contents operations 
we recognized million and million of collaborative research and development revenue from related party in and  respectively  relating to research performed by us in those periods 
the rates charged for work performed by us are consistent with the rates charged for other collaborations 
in addition  we received a payment of million in relating to past research and recognized million and  of this payment as collaborative research and development revenue from related party in and  respectively 
the remaining amount will be recognized ratably over the term of the related research plans 
verdia and delta pine and land company are committed to fund the joint venture in an amount sufficient to pay the anticipated development costs  but neither party is required to provide funding in excess of million each 
we funded the joint venture in the amount of million and million as capital contributions in and  respectively  which reflects verdia s ownership interest 
on july   maxygen and several third party investors formed avidia research institute 
in conjunction with its initial capitalization  we contributed certain technology to avidia and invested  we have an equity interest of in avidia based upon the voting rights of the issued and outstanding shares of avidia s common and preferred stock 
our investment in avidia is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting and results are recorded as a component of equity in net loss of joint venture and minority interests in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december  we had recorded losses equal to our investment basis in avidia and we do not currently expect to be recording any additional losses from avidia in maxygen is not obligated to fund avidia s operating losses 
goodwill and intangible impairment in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition  we allocated million to goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets are generally evaluated on an individual acquisition or market basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired or the estimated useful lives are no longer appropriate 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  if certain indicators of impairment exist  we will review our long lived assets including goodwill for impairment based on estimated future discounted cash flows attributable to the assets and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  the assets will be written down to their estimated fair values 
no impairment charges were recorded in  or in the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for various products and business strategies 
if any of the significant assumptions differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  this could result in different valuations for goodwill and intangible assets 
once it is established  we must test goodwill annually for impairment using a two step process as required by sfas no 
in addition  in certain circumstances  we must assess if goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests 
intangible assets with definite useful lives must be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we conduct our impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles  factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include significant continued under performance compared to peers  significant changes in the underlying business and products of our reporting units  or other factors specific to each asset or reporting unit being evaluated 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we recognize revenues from research collaboration agreements as earned upon our achievement of the performance requirements of the agreements 
our existing corporate collaboration agreements generally provide 
table of contents for research funding for a specified number of full time equivalent researchers working in defined research programs 
revenue related to these payments is earned as the related research work is performed 
in addition  these collaborators may make technology advancement payments that are intended to fund further development of our core technology  as opposed to a defined research program 
such payments are recognized ratably over the applicable funding period 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are achieved 
as of december   we have deferred revenues of approximately million that we expect to recognize over the next approximately two years 
revenue related to performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
substantive  at risk incentive milestones  if any  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone event when we have no future performance obligations related to the payment and we judge the event to be the culmination of a separate earnings process 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to maxygen  such as regulatory approval to market a product 
we receive royalties from licensees  which are based on sales to third parties of licensed products 
royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party results can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology advancement funding that is intended for the development of our core technology  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
the determination of separate units of accounting in arrangements involving multiple deliverables as required under eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  requires management to exercise judgment as to whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the collaborator and to estimate whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
our collaborative agreements may contain multiple deliverables that require management to determine whether or not the deliverables are separate units of accounting 
revenue related to grant agreements with various government agencies is recognized as the related research and development expenses are incurred  and when these research and development expenses are within the prior approved funding amounts 
certain grant agreements provide an option for the government to audit the amount of research and development expenses  both direct and indirect  that have been submitted to the government agency for reimbursement 
we believe the overhead rates we used to calculate our indirect research and development expenses are within the contractual guidelines of allowable costs and are reasonable estimates of our indirect expenses incurred through the term of the agreements 
our sources of potential revenues for the next several years are likely to be license  research  technology advancement and milestone payments under existing and possible future collaborative arrangements  government research grants  and royalties from our collaborators based upon revenues received from any products commercialized under those agreements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
deferred compensation deferred compensation for options granted to employees has been determined as the difference between the deemed fair market value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on the date the applicable options were granted and the exercise price 
deferred compensation for options granted to consultants has been determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas and emerging issues task force issue no 
accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf as the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
compensation for related options granted to consultants is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest 

table of contents in connection with the grant of stock options to employees before our initial public offering  we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million in and million in these amounts were initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity and are being amortized as charges to operations over the vesting period of the options using a graded vesting method 
we recognized stock compensation expense related to the deferred compensation amortization on these option grants  which are split between research and development expense and general and administrative expense  as shown in the following table in thousands research and development general and administrative this deferred stock compensation of  at december  will be fully amortized to expense by the end of in connection with the grant of stock options to consultants  we recorded stock compensation expense of  in   in and  in  which were included in research and development expense  and  in each of the years and and  in  which were included in general and administrative expense 
in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition in august  stock options were granted in exchange for outstanding warrants to purchase maxygen aps securities 
in connection with this exchange we recorded aggregate deferred compensation totaling million 
this amount was amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options  of which  was expensed in   in and  in this deferred compensation has now been fully amortized to expense 
also in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition  maxygen shares were exchanged for maxygen aps shares 
for the shares exchanged that had a right of repurchase  we recorded deferred compensation of million 
this amount was amortized to expense over a three year graded vesting period 
a total of million was recognized as expense in  million in and  in this deferred compensation has now been fully amortized to expense 
results of operations revenues our total revenues increased from million in to million in then decreased to million in the increase in collaborative research and development revenue of million from to was due to additional strategic alliances and the expansion of existing alliances 
the decline in collaborative research and development revenue of million from to was primarily due to the decrease in partner funding as the funded research terms of the collaborations with intermune and lundbeck wound down on schedule  offset in part by collaborative research and development revenue from our collaboration with roche  which began in july collaborative research and development revenue from related party relates to revenue from deltamax cotton llc  the joint venture between verdia and delta and pine land company 
upon the formation of the joint venture in may  verdia began to perform research for and recognize revenue from deltamax cotton llc 
the increase in revenue of million from to is due to ramp up and a partial year of activity in versus a full year of activity in the decline in grant revenue of million from to and million from to primarily reflects the expiration of four us government grants from the defense advanced research projects agency that began in and and ended on various dates  the last of which was september in  we expect our consolidated revenue to be in the range of to million  consisting of collaboration revenue  grant revenue and royalties on product sales from existing collaborations and the establishment of new industrial collaboration agreements 

table of contents in we had two major collaborative partners  defined as those contributing greater than of total collaborative research revenue in for whom we conducted research and development 
in january we extended the research term of our collaborative agreement with one such major collaborative partner  pioneer hi bred international  inc  while a potential long term renewal of the collaboration is being negotiated 
the funded research term of the collaboration with our other major collaborative partner  deltamax cotton llc  is subject to research agreements that cover single calendar years and that are reviewed  and if mutually acceptable  renewed  annually 
in  revenue recognized from pioneer hi bred international  inc and deltamax cotton llc represented  in aggregate  of our total revenues 
revenues for each operating segment are derived from our research collaboration agreements and government research grants and are categorized based on the industry of the product or technology under development 
after their capitalization in march  the results of codexis are shown as our chemicals segment and results of verdia are shown as our agriculture segment 
the following table presents revenues for each operating segment in thousands year ended december  human therapeutics chemicals agriculture total revenue the increase in revenue for each segment from to was due to additional strategic alliances and the expansion of existing alliances 
for human therapeutics and chemicals  these increases are partially offset by the decline in government research grant revenue 
the decrease in revenues for our human therapeutics segment primarily reflects the scheduled winding down of the funded research terms of our collaborations with intermune and lundbeck  offset in part by collaborative research and development revenue from our collaboration with roche  which began in july we expect revenue from our human therapeutics segment to decrease in as we continue to implement our strategy of concentrating on internally funded research and development and reduce our dependence on partner funded research and development 
the increase in revenue for our chemicals segment from to is primarily due to a one time termination payment of million from hercules received in to terminate our collaboration agreement entered into with them in  offset in part by decreased revenue from the termination of that collaboration 
the increase in revenue of our agriculture segment from to is primarily due to the receipt of a million product development milestone from pioneer hi bred received in  offset in part by a reduction in collaborative revenue from our syngenta collaboration 
research and development expenses we have entered into a number of research and development collaborations to perform research for our collaborators 
the major collaborative agreements have similar contractual terms 
the agreements generally require us to devote a specified number of full time equivalent employees to the research efforts over defined terms generally ranging from three to five years 
we do not generally track fully burdened research and development costs or capital expenditures by project 
however  we estimate  based on full time equivalent effort  that the percentage of research and development efforts as measured in hours incurred  which approximates costs undertaken for collaborative projects funded by our collaborators and government grants was approximately in  in and in the percentage of research effort as measured by hours incurred  which approximates costs undertaken for our own internally funded research projects was approximately in  in and in due to the nature of our research and our dependence on our collaborative partners to commercialize the results of the 
table of contents research  we cannot predict with any certainty whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product and therefore whether we will receive future milestone payments or royalty payments under our various collaborations 
most of our human therapeutic  agriculture and chemical product development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any marketed products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
human therapeutic product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to pass through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and with acceptable quality 
chemical and agricultural product candidates may be found ineffective  may cause undesirable side effects or may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and with acceptable quality 
furthermore  it is uncertain which of our internally developed product candidates will be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate or it may delay the time and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report titled risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost in any particular case 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  facility costs  research consultants and external collaborative research expenses  supplies and depreciation of facilities and laboratory equipment 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in then decreased to million in the million increase from to was primarily due to increased salaries  expansion of strategic alliances including pre clinical costs and depreciation  as well as investments in our technology platform and in the development of product candidates 
the million decrease from to was primarily due to contraction of activities in strategic alliances including reduced pre clinical costs and reduced utilization of research consultants 
the reduction of collaborative activities also lead to reduced spending on supplies and outside patent costs 
stock compensation expense related to research and development was million in  million in and million in the decrease in stock compensation expenses was primarily the result of lower amortization expense related to deferred compensation for the shares subject to repurchase that were exchanged in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition in august this deferred compensation was amortized to expense over a three year graded vesting period 
the deferred compensation related to the maxygen aps acquisition was fully amortized to expense during  the  of deferred compensation related to options granted to employees involved in research and development activities before our initial public offering remaining at december  is expected to be fully amortized to expense by the end of we expect research and development costs to increase during as we increase our efforts on internally funded projects 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect research and development expenses to increase in the next several years if we are successful in advancing our products into clinical trials 
to the extent we out license our products prior to commencement of clinical trials or collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials  increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided 
we intend to manage the level of our expenditures for research and development  including clinical trials  to balance advancing our products against maintaining adequate cash resources for our operations 

table of contents general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  business development  legal and general management  as well as insurance premiums and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting 
general and administrative expenses have decreased from million in to million in and to million in the decrease from to was primarily due to receipt of expense reimbursement from litigation with enchira biotechnology received in  partially offset by increased costs of directors and officers liability insurance and increased professional fees 
the decrease from to was primarily due to lower salaries reflecting slightly lower headcount and lower corporate communications expenses 
general and administrative stock compensation expense was million in  million in and  in the decrease in stock compensation expense was primarily a result of lower amortization expense related to deferred compensation for stock options granted to employees before our initial public offering 
this deferred compensation is being amortized to expense over the vesting period of the options using a graded vesting method 
the  of deferred compensation relating to options granted to employees involved in general and administrative activities before our initial public offering remaining at december  is expected to be fully amortized to expense by the end of we expect that our general and administrative expenses may increase modestly for at least the next several years as a result of increased professional fees and insurance premiums 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition  we allocated million to goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption of sfas in january  we stopped amortizing goodwill and assembled workforce 
however  we continued to amortize the purchased core technology over its three year useful life 
such technology was fully amortized to expense by september we recorded amortization expense of million in  million in and  in net interest and other income net interest and other income represents income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  net of interest expense on our equipment leases and currency transaction gains or losses 
net interest and other income decreased from million in to million in to million in the decreases were due to declining interest rates and lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  partially offset by foreign exchange transactions related to the funding of our danish subsidiary maxygen aps which include a  loss in  million gain in  and million gain in equity in net loss of joint venture and minority interests equity in net loss of joint venture and minority interests reflects our share of the net loss of deltamax cotton llc and avidia research institute 
deltamax cotton llc was formed in may and is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in addition to recording our share of the net losses from deltamax cotton llc  we recorded revenue from deltamax cotton llc as collaborative research and development revenue from related party of million in and million in relating to research performed by us for the deltamax cotton llc joint venture 
avidia research institute was formed in july and is also being accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
equity in net loss of joint venture and minority interests increased from million in to million in the increase in net loss in is primarily due to the deltamax joint venture being fully operational for the entire twelve month period of 
table of contents and the start of operations of avidia 
as of december  we had recorded losses equal to our investment basis in avidia and do not currently expect to be recording any additional losses from avidia in maxygen is not obligated to fund avidia s operating losses 
subsidiary preferred stock accretion on september   codexis sold million of codexis preferred stock to investors  of which million was purchased by maxygen and million was purchased by several unrelated investors 
on october   codexis sold an additional million of preferred stock to unrelated investors 
this series of convertible preferred stock included a redemption provision  which provided that the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of this convertible preferred stock excluding the convertible preferred stock held by maxygen and its affiliates  voting together as a separate class  may require codexis to redeem the convertible preferred stock 
the redemption price for each share will be payable in cash in exchange for the shares of convertible preferred stock to be redeemed at a sum equal to the applicable original issue price per share plus five percent of the original issue price per year from the original issue date until the applicable redemption date  plus declared and unpaid dividends 
notice of redemption can be given at any time on or after the fifth anniversary of the original issue date 
in connection with these redemption rights  we recorded accretion of the redemption premium for the convertible preferred stock  excluding the shares owned by maxygen  in the amount of million for the year ended decenber  the accretion is recorded as subsidiary preferred stock accretion on the consolidated statement of operations and as a reduction of additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheets 
any obligation to make redemption payments is solely an obligation of codexis and any payments are to be made solely from assets of codexis 
provision for income taxes we incurred net operating losses in  and  and consequently did not pay any us federal or state income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in the years through included in our federal net operating loss carryforwards and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards at december  are amounts relating to codexis  a subsidiary that is not included in our federal consolidated return 
these carryforwards will only be available to offset future federal taxable income of the subsidiary 
at december   the federal net operating loss carryforwards relating to codexis were approximately million and the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards relating to codexis were approximately  these carryforwards expire in the years through utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating losses and credits before utilization

new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards referred to as sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue referred to as eitf no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  not at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan  as required under eitf the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in november  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a company for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf issue no 
addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
eitf issue no

the provisions of eitf issue no 
apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning on or after july  the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structures used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another entity 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities at the end of the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we have concluded that none of our unconsolidated subsidiaries or other legal arrangements is a variable interest entity 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of equity securities  receiving aggregate consideration from such sales totaling million and research and development funding from collaborators and government grants totaling approximately million 
in addition  our majority owned subsidiary  codexis  received million from a private placement of its equity securities with third party investors 
codexis also received million from a concurrent private placement from maxygen 
as of december   we had a total of million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  million of which may only be used for codexis operations and million of which is held by verdia 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in uses of cash in operating activities were primarily to fund net losses 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in net cash provided by investing activities in was million 
the cash used during and primarily represented purchases of available for sale securities 
the cash provided during was primarily from the maturities of available for sale securities 
additions of property and equipment were million in  million in and million in the additions in were primarily due to the expansion of our offices and laboratories in redwood city  ca as well as new equipment purchased for maxygen aps 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in the purchase of property and equipment to support our operations 
we may use a portion of our cash to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  or to obtain the right to use such technologies 

table of contents in connection with our joint venture  deltamax cotton llc  verdia and delta and pine land company are committed to fund the joint venture in an amount sufficient to pay its anticipated development costs  but neither party is required to provide funding in excess of million 
we funded the joint venture through capital contributions in the amount of million in and million in  which reflects our ownership interest 
maxygen s contributions to deltamax cotton llc to date have been million as of december  in connection with the formation of avidia research institute  maxygen contributed certain intellectual property and invested  in july net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and  in the cash provided in was primarily from the proceeds of the sale of common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase plan espp and the exercise of stock options by employees 
this was partially offset by payments on equipment financing obligations of  the cash provided in was primarily proceeds from the financing of the minority investment in codexis 
the cash provided in was primarily from the proceeds of the sale of common stock in connection with our espp and the exercise of stock options by employees of million offset by an equity adjustment from foreign currency translation of million and payments on equipment financing obligations of  the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt and lease obligations in thousands payments due by period contractual commitments total year years operating leases short term debt total contractual commitments in february  codexis entered into an equipment financing agreement with a financing company for up to million of equipment purchases 
the financing agreement expires december  the equipment loans will be repaid over months at an interest rate tied to the prime lending rate at the time the loan is executed and are secured by the related equipment 
since inception we have received million in funding from our collaborators and from government grants  which includes million of deferred revenue to be recognized over the next two years 
approximately million was received from our collaborators and million was received from government funding 
assuming our research efforts for existing collaborations and grants continue for their full research terms  as of december  we had total committed funding of approximately million remaining to be received over the next two years 
potential milestone payments from our existing collaborations could exceed million based on the accomplishment of specific performance criteria 
we may also earn royalties on product sales 
in general  the obligation of our corporate collaborators to provide research funding cannot be terminated by either party before the end of the research term unless there has been a material breach of contract or either party has become bankrupt or insolvent 
in the case of such an event  the agreement specifies the rights  if any  that each party will retain 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  together with funding received from collaborators and government grants  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we will seek additional financing within this timeframe 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
additional funding  if sought  may not be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results

in addition we also report cash utilization  which approximates our net operating cash use 
both non gaap net loss and cash utilization are considered a non gaap financial measure according to sec rules 
we believe that non gaap net income loss and cash utilization provide useful information in understanding our ongoing financial condition 
stock compensation expense  amortization of intangible assets and subsidiary preferred stock accretion the adjustments to gaap net income loss are non cash expenses generated as a result of infrequent events that do not have direct operational significance 
as a result we believe that non gaap net income loss provides useful information to investors as to our ongoing operations 
in addition  cash utilization non gaap net loss excluding depreciation but adjusted to include capital expenditures provides information about our net operating cash use a useful measure to determine how much cash our operations are spending 
management uses non gaap net income loss and cash utilization in analyzing the performance of each of our operating business segments and in analyzing the performance of maxygen as a whole 
we also use such measures in making operating decisions including pipeline portfolio management and capital expenditure decisions

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange 
to mitigate some of these risks  we from time to time enter currency forward contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including corporate obligations and money market funds 
all securities are held in us currency except for amounts held in our danish subsidiary in danish kroner 
as of december   approximately of our total portfolio will mature in one year or less  with the remainder maturing in less than two years 
the following table represents the fair value balance of our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  dollars in thousands expected maturity cash and cash equivalents average interest rates short term investments average interest rates long term investments average interest rates we did not hold derivative instruments intended to mitigate interest rate risk as of december   and we have never held such instruments in the past 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately million 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
in addition  we had outstanding debt related to equipment financing of  as of december   with a range of interest rates of between and 
foreign currency exchange risk a portion of our operations consist of research and development activities performed in denmark by our wholly owned subsidiary  maxygen aps 
the functional currency of maxygen aps is the danish kroner 
in  of our operating expenses related to maxygen aps 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of denmark 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar against the danish kroner will result in an increase of our non us dollar based operating expenses 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we from time to time enter cash flow hedging arrangements 
no hedges are currently in place 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging arrangements 
our hedging arrangements reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
gains and losses on these foreign currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to maxygen 
at december  we had no foreign currency cash flow forward contracts outstanding
