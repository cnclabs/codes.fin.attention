item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data  and with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
reportable segments we have two reportable operating businesses marine and aviation fuel services 
in our marine fuel services business  we market marine fuel and related management services to a broad base of international shipping companies and to the united states and foreign militaries 
services include credit terms  hour around the world service  fuel management services  and competitively priced fuel 
in our aviation fuel services business  we extend credit and provide around the world single supplier convenience  hour service  fuel management services  and competitively priced aviation fuel and other aviation related services to passenger  cargo and charter airlines  as well as to united states and foreign militaries 
we also offer flight plans and weather reports to our corporate customers 
the following table provides the contribution percentage of each of our two reportable operating businesses on our total revenue and our operating income excluding corporate overhead for each of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  for the nine months ended december  for the year ended march  unaudited unaudited revenue marine fuel services aviation fuel services operating income  excluding corporate overhead marine fuel services aviation fuel services critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  deferred tax assets and liabilities  goodwill and identifiable intangible asset  and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
page of 
table of contents we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
revenue recognition revenue is recorded in the period when the sale is made or as the services are performed 
we contract with third parties to provide fuel and or deliver most services 
accounts receivable and allowance for bad debts credit extension  monitoring and collection are performed by each of our business segments 
each segment has a credit committee 
the credit committees are responsible for approving credit limits above certain amounts  setting and maintaining credit standards  and managing the overall quality of the credit portfolio 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of our customer s credit information 
we extend credit on an unsecured basis to many of our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience with our customers  current market conditions of our customers  and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
we had accounts and notes receivable of million and million  net of allowance for bad debts of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
we believe the level of our allowance for bad debts is reasonable based on our experience and our analysis of the net realizable value of our trade receivables at december  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past since adverse changes in the marine and aviation industries  or changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers  could have a material adverse effect on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
if credit losses exceed established allowances  our results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected 
for additional information on the credit risks inherent in our business  see risk factors in item of this form k 
goodwill  identifiable intangible assets and investment goodwill goodwill and investment goodwill represent our cost or investment in excess of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  of the acquired companies 
investment goodwill of approximately million was included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december  and the identifiable intangible asset for customer relations existing at the date of acquisition of million was recorded and is being amortized over its useful life of five years 
effective april  as permitted  we elected to early adopt sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
established accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets  and states that goodwill shall not be amortized prospectively 
accordingly  no goodwill amortization was recorded subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
we recorded goodwill amortization of thousand  including investment goodwill amortization of thousand  for the year ended march  we recorded amortization of our identifiable intangible asset of thousand for the years ended december  and  thousand for the nine months ended december  and  and thousand for the year ended march  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill must be reviewed annually or more frequently under certain circumstances for impairment 
the initial step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
based on results of these comparisons as of december   goodwill in each of our reporting units is not considered impaired 
accordingly  no impairment charges were recognized 
income taxes our provision for income taxes was determined by taxable jurisdiction 
we file a consolidated us federal income tax return which includes all of our us companies 
our us companies file income tax returns in their respective countries of incorporation  as required 
we do not provide for us federal and state income taxes  and us withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of our non us companies 
the distribution of these earnings would result in additional us federal page of 
table of contents and state income taxes to the extent they are not offset by foreign tax credits and non us withholding taxes 
it is our intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of our non us companies indefinitely and thereby postpone their remittance 
accordingly  no provision has been made for taxes that could result from the remittance of such earnings 
we provide for deferred income taxes on temporary differences arising from assets and liabilities whose bases are different for financial reporting and us federal  state and us income tax purposes 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that an income tax benefit will not be realized 
no valuation allowance was recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
results of operations profit from our marine fuel services business is determined primarily by the volume and commission rate of brokering business generated and by the volume and gross profit achieved on sales  as well as the overall level of operating expenses  which may be significantly affected to the extent that we are required to provide for potential bad debts 
profit from our aviation fuel services business is directly related to the volume and the gross profit achieved on sales  as well as the overall level of operating expenses  which may be significantly affected to the extent that we are required to provide for potential bad debts 
in february  april  and january  we acquired the operations of norse bunker as  the marine energy group of companies  and the oil shipping group of companies  respectively 
these acquisitions form part of our worldwide marine fuel marketing segment and were accounted for as purchases 
accordingly  the results of operations of these acquisitions were included with our results since their respective dates of acquisition 
in december  we entered into a joint venture agreement with signature flight support corporation through the acquisition of a equity interest in pafco 
under the equity method of accounting  we have recorded our share of the results of pafco since january our profitability was favorably impacted in by increases in business volume for both marine and aviation  and marine s gross profit per metric ton traded and brokered 
in addition  included in the results for the year ended december  were two non recurring charges totaling million 
the non recurring charges consisted of executive severance charges of million  of which million related to our former chief executive officer and the remaining amounts were for our former chief financial officer  chief information officer  and two other executives  and a million charge for the settlement of the remaining balance on a court judgment against donald f 
moorehead  jr  who defaulted on his agreement to purchase earthcare company stock owned by us  which was received in connection with the sale of our oil recycling subsidiaries in february earnings in were adversely affected by a decrease in gross profit per gallon in aviation and increases in all three categories of expenses salaries and wages  provision for bad debts and other operating expenses 
the lower gross profit per gallon sold in aviation was primarily due to increased fuel management business and wholesale activities  which are higher credit quality and lower margin business and activities 
partially offsetting the impact of these lower margin activities on gross profit in aviation was new commercial and government business 
the increase in salaries and wages was due to new employees to support our business process improvements and continued business expansion  the front end cost of some business process improvement initiatives  and payments and accruals for performance based incentive compensation payouts 
incentive compensation accounted for the largest part of the salaries and wages increase 
the increase in the provision for bad debts is primarily due to additional general provision for bad debts resulting from the write off of receivables from two bankrupt international airlines 
the increase in other operating expenses was also primarily related to our business process improvements and continued business expansion  as well as to higher overall operating costs primarily relating to insurance  office rent  depreciation and amortization  travel and entertainment  and independent directors cash compensation and non cash compensation related to stock based awards 
we may experience decreases in future sales volume and margins as a result of deterioration in the world economy  or in the shipping or aviation industries  and continued conflicts and instability in the middle east  asia and latin america  as well as potential future terrorist activities and possible military retaliation 
in addition  world oil prices have been very volatile over the last several years 
we expect continued volatility in world oil prices as a result of the instability in the middle east 
since fuel costs represent a significant part of a vessel s and airline s operating expenses  volatility in fuel prices can adversely affect our customers business  and consequently our results of operations

this gross margin increase resulted from a drop in the average price per metric ton traded  which offset a lower gross profit per metric ton traded 
the narrower gross profit per metric ton traded was caused by competitive pressures  and by the marine acquisitions which resulted in the addition of lower margin trading business

our aviation fueling business achieved a gross margin for the year ended march   as compared to achieved for the prior year 
this increase resulted from an overall increase in the gross profit per gallon sold and the decline in the average price per gallon sold

 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
expands upon and strengthens existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin no 
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  we determined that we do not have any variable interest entities created after january  in december  fasb revised fin no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to take advantage of favorable market conditions or for competitive reasons  we enter into short term cancelable fuel purchase commitments for the physical delivery of product 
we simultaneously may hedge the physical delivery of fuel through a commodity based derivative instrument  to minimize the effects of commodity price fluctuations 
as part of our price risk management services  we offer to our marine and aviation customers fixed fuel prices on future sales with  or without  physical delivery of fuel 
typically  we simultaneously enter into a commodity based derivative instrument with a counterparty to hedge our variable fuel price on related future purchases with  or without  physical delivery of fuel 
the counterparties are major oil companies and derivative trading firms 
accordingly  we do not anticipate non performance by such counterparties 
pursuant to these transactions  we are not affected by market price fluctuations since the contracts have the same terms and conditions except for the fee or spread earned by us 
performance risk under these contracts is considered a credit risk 
this risk is minimized by dealing with customers meeting stricter credit criteria 
as of december   we have eight outstanding swaps contracts totaling approximately thousand metric tons of marine fuel  with monthly settlements through december  and nine outstanding swaps contracts totaling million gallons of aviation fuel  with monthly settlements through december as of december   we have recorded our derivatives  which consisted of swaps contracts  at their fair market value of million 
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  such amount was included as prepaid expenses and other current assets with an offsetting amount in accrued expenses 
for additional information  see derivatives in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
we conduct the vast majority of our business transactions in us dollars 
however  in certain markets  primarily in mexico  payments to our aviation fuel supplier are denominated in local currency 
in addition  in mexico  payments from some of our customers are also denominated in local currency 
this subjects us to foreign currency exchange risk  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we seek to minimize the risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations through our regular operating and financing activities 
our policy is to not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
