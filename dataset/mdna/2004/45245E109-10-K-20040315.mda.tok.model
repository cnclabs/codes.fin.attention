item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the principal business of imax corporation together with its wholly owned subsidiaries the company is the design  manufacture  sale and lease of projection systems for large format theaters including commercial theaters  museums and science centers  and destination entertainment sites 
in addition  the company designs and manufactures high end sound systems and produces and distributes large format films 
at december   there were imax theaters operating in countries 
the company derives revenue principally from long term theater system lease and sale agreements  maintenance agreements  and film distribution and production agreements 
the company also derives revenue from the operation of its own theaters  camera rentals and post production services 
important factors that the company s ceos use in assessing the company s business and prospects include the signing of new theater systems  profits from the company s business units  earnings from operations as adjusted for unusual items that the company views as non recurring  such as costs associated with the repurchase and refinancing of the company s senior notes due the old senior notes  and the success of strategic initiatives such as the securing of new film projects  particularly imax dmr and imax d film projects 
theater systems the company generally provides its theater systems to customers on a long term lease basis  typically with initial lease terms of to years 
lease agreements typically provide for three major sources of revenue initial rental fees  ongoing rental payments  which include annual contractual minimum payments  and maintenance fees 
the initial rental fees vary depending on the type of system and location and generally are paid to the company in installments commencing upon the signing of the agreement 
ongoing rental payments are paid monthly over the term of the contract  commencing after system installation and are generally equal to the greater of a fixed minimum amount per annum and a percentage of box office receipts 
ongoing rental payments include rental income and finance income 
an annual maintenance fee is generally payable commencing after the warranty period 
both minimum rental payments and maintenance fees are typically indexed to the local consumer price index 
revenue on theater system leases and sales are recognized at a different time than when cash is collected 
see significant accounting policies below for further discussion on the company s revenue recognition policies 
periodically  the company sells theater systems to customers 
these sales generally provide for upfront cash payments received prior to installation and the receipt of minimum payments over time  typically to years 
cash received from initial rental fees in advance of installation is recorded as deferred revenue 
the associated costs of manufacturing the theater system are recorded as inventory 
at the time of installation  the deferred revenue is recognized in income  and the inventory costs are fully expensed 
the timing of installation of the theater system is largely dependent on the timing of the construction of the customer s theater 
therefore  while revenue for theater systems is generally predictable on a long term basis  it can vary substantially from year to year or quarter to quarter depending on the timing of installation 
as at december   there were installed d flat screen systems  installed d dome screen systems  installed d standard systems and installed d sr systems in the world 
as at december   there were installed d flat screen systems  installed d dome screen systems  installed d standard systems and installed d sr systems in the world 
the north american commercial exhibitor market represents an important customer base for the company in terms of both collections under existing long term leases and potential future system contracts 
in and  many of the north american commercial exhibitor chains faced financial difficulties due to over expansion  which in some cases led to bankruptcy proceedings and or consolidations 
many of these exhibitors have emerged from those proceedings with new capital  including from the public markets 
while the company views these developments in the north american commercial exhibitor market as positive  there is no assurance that they will continue or that other commercial exhibitors will not encounter additional financial difficulties 
to minimize the company s credit risk in this area  the company retains title to underlying theater systems leased  registers theater systems sold as collateral  performs initial and ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and makes ongoing provisions for its estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts 
page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d theater systems cont d the average initial rent or sales price charged to customers under the company s theater system lease or sales agreements can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year based on a number of factors including the type of system sold or leased  the region of the world  the type of contract and other factors specific to individual contracts 
the company has taken steps in recent years to accelerate the growth of the global imax theater network and the sale or lease of its products by developing lower cost systems designed to appeal to broader customer bases  particularly in commercial multiplex markets 
although such systems are lower cost  the company has endeavored to successfully maintain its percentage margins on a unit basis and maintain aggregate sales margins through increased volume 
the company signed twenty five theater system agreements in  
sales backlog during the year ended december   the company signed contracts for imax theaters  valued at million 
at december   the sales backlog  which represented contracts for theater systems  totaled million 
the sales backlog will vary from quarter to quarter depending on the signing of new theater systems  which adds to backlog  and the installation of theater systems and the settlement of theater system contracts  both of which reduce backlog 
sales backlog typically represents the minimum revenue under signed theater system sale and lease agreements that the company believes will be recognized as revenue as the associated theater systems are installed 
operating leases are assigned no value in the sales backlog 
the minimum revenue comprises the upfront payments plus the present value of the minimum payments due under sales type lease and sale agreements 
the value of sales backlog does not include revenue from theaters in which the company has an equity interest  letters of intent or long term conditional theater commitments 
in the normal course of its business the company each year will have customers who  for a number of reasons including the inability to obtain certain consents  approvals or financing  are unable to proceed with theater construction 
once the determination is made that the customer will not proceed with installation  the lease agreement with the customer is generally terminated and removed from backlog 
upon the company being released from its future obligations under the agreement  the initial lease payments that the customer previously made to the company are recognized as revenue 
film production and distribution effective january   the company adopted sop accounting by producers or distributors of films 
the company recognizes revenue from licensing of exhibition rights to motion pictures produced or distributed by the company when the film is complete and has been delivered  the license period has begun  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
where the license fees are based on a share of the customer s revenue  and all other revenue recognition criteria are met  the company recognizes revenue as the customer exhibits the film 
costs of producing films and acquiring film distribution rights are capitalized and amortized using the individual film forecast computation method  which amortizes film costs and accrues participation costs in the same ratio that current period actual revenue bears to estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenue as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
all advertising  exploitation costs and marketing costs are expensed as incurred 
the company has developed a proprietary  patent pending technology to digitally re master mm live action films into format film at a modest cost for exhibition in imax theaters 
this system  known as imax dmr  digitally enhances the image resolution quality of mm motion picture films for projection on imax screens while maintaining the visual clarity and sound quality for which the imax experience is known 
the company believes that this technology has opened the imax theater network up to potential releases of hollywood films including both library titles and contemporaneous new releases 
the company believes that the development of this new technology is key to helping it execute on its strategy of growing its commercial theater network by becoming a new release window for hollywood films 
while the company is optimistic about the imax dmr technology  there is no guarantee that it will be commercially successful or receive widespread acceptance by film studios 
page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d theater operations the company has seven owned and operated theaters 
in addition  the company has entered into commercial arrangements with two theaters resulting in the sharing of profits and losses 
the company also provides management services to two theaters 
international operations a significant portion of the company s sales are made to customers located outside the united states and canada 
during  and   and  respectively  of the company s revenue was derived outside the united states and canada 
the company expects that international operations will continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenue in the future 
in order to minimize exposure to exchange rate risk  the company prices theater systems the largest component of revenue in us dollars except in canada and japan where they may be priced in canadian dollars and japanese yen  respectively 
annual minimum rental payments and maintenance fees follow a similar currency policy 
significant accounting policies the company reports its results under both united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and canadian generally accepted accounting principles 
the financial statements and results referred to herein are reported under us gaap 
the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  net investment in leases  inventories  fixed and film assets  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  future expectations and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events  which are continuous in nature 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of its audited financial statements in item the company considers the following critical accounting policies to have the most significant effect on its estimates  assumptions and judgments revenue recognition sales type leases of theater systems theater system leases that transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to customers are classified as sales type leases as a result of meeting the criteria established by fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases fas 
when revenue is recognized  the initial rental fees due under the contract  along with the present value of minimum ongoing rental payments  are recorded as revenues for the period  and the related projector costs including installation expenses are recorded as cost of goods and services 
additional ongoing rentals in excess of minimums are recognized as revenue when reported by the theater operator  provided that collection is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenues from sales type leases upon installation of the theater system 
revenue associated with a sales type lease is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the timing of installation of the theater system is largely dependent on the timing of the construction of the customer s theater 
therefore  while revenue for theater systems is generally predictable on a long term basis  it can vary from quarter to quarter or year to year depending on the timing of installation 
page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d significant accounting policies cont d revenue recognition cont d sales type leases of theater systems cont d the company monitors the performance of the theaters to which it has leased equipment 
when facts and circumstances indicate that it may need to change the terms of a lease which had previously been recorded as a sales type lease  the company evaluates the likely outcome of such negotiations 
a provision is recorded against the net investment in leases if the company believes that it is probable that the negotiation will result in a reduction in the minimum lease payments such that the lease will be reclassified as an operating lease 
the provision is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the net investment in lease over the fair value of the equipment 
in the ordinary course of its business  the company will from time to time determine that a provision it had previously taken against the net investment in leases in connection with a customer s lease agreement should be reversed due to a change in the circumstances that led to the original provision 
if the company and a lessee agree to change the terms of the lease  other than by renewing the lease or extending its terms  management evaluates whether the new agreement would be classified as a sales type lease or an operating lease under the provisions of fas any adjustments which result from a change in classification from a sales type lease to an operating lease are reported as a charge to income during the period the change occurs 
in the normal course of its business  the company each year will have customers who  for a number of reasons including the inability to obtain certain consents  approvals or financing  are unable to proceed with theater construction 
in these instances  where customers of the company are not in compliance with the terms of their leases for theater systems not yet installed  the leases are in default 
there is typically deferred revenue associated with these leases  representing initial lease payments collected prior to the default 
these initial lease payments are recognized as revenue when the company exercises its rights to terminate the lease and the company is released legally and or by virtue of an agreement with the customer from its obligations under the lease arrangement 
when settlements are received  the company will allocate the total settlement to each of the elements based on their relative fair value 
operating leases of theater systems leases that do not transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to the customer are classified as operating leases 
for these leases  initial rental fees and minimum lease payments are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the lease term 
additional rentals in excess of minimum annual amounts are recognized as revenue when reported by theater operators  provided that collection is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable and financing receivables the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and provision against the financing receivables are based on the company s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances and the underlying asset value of the equipment under lease where applicable 
if there is a deterioration in a customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults under the terms of the leases are higher than the company s historical experience  the company s estimates of recoverability for these assets could be adversely affected 
inventories in establishing the appropriate provisions for theater systems inventory  management must make estimates of future events and conditions including the anticipated installation dates for the current backlog of theater system contracts  potential future signings  general economic conditions  technology factors  growth prospects within the customers ultimate marketplace and the market acceptance of the company s current and pending projection systems and film library 
if management estimates of these events and conditions prove to be incorrect  it could result in inventory losses in excess of the provisions determined to be adequate as at the balance sheet date 
page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d significant accounting policies cont d goodwill the company adopted fasb statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangibles fas effective january  upon adoption of this standard  no impairment in goodwill was found to exist 
the company performs an impairment test on at least an annual basis and additionally  whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flows approach 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
any impairment loss would be expensed in the statement of operations 
fixed assets management reviews the carrying values of its fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
in performing its review for recoverability  management estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
measurement of impairment losses is based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
if the actual future cash flows are less than the company s estimates  future earnings could be adversely affected 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this standard requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and subsequently amortized over the asset s useful life 
accordingly  the company recorded a charge in its consolidated results of operations for including a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million  which was recorded as a reduction of net income 
page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d tax asset valuation as at december   the company had net deferred income tax assets of million  comprised of tax credit carryforwards  net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences  which can be utilized to reduce either taxable income or taxes otherwise payable in future years 
the company s management assesses realization of these net deferred income tax assets based on all available evidence and has concluded that it is more likely than not that these net deferred income tax assets will be realized 
positive evidence includes  but is not limited to  the company s projected future earnings based on contracted sales backlog at december   and the ability to realize certain deferred income tax assets through loss and tax credit carryback strategies 
if and when the company s operations in some jurisdictions were to reach a requisite level of profitability or where the company s future profitability estimates increase due to changes in positive evidence  the company would reduce all or a portion of the applicable valuation allowance in the period when such determination is made 
this would result in an increase to reported earnings and a decrease to the company s effective tax rate in such period 
however  if the company s projected future earnings do not materialize  or if the company operates at a loss in certain jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in actual effective tax rates or time period within which the company s underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  the company could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of the company s deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase to the company s effective tax rate for the period of the change and a material adverse impact on its operating results for the period 
adjustments to the company s valuation allowance  through charges credits to expense  were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as at december   the company had a gross deferred income tax asset of million  against which the company is carrying a million valuation allowance 
the company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  the company may incur additional tax expense based upon the outcomes of such matters 
in addition  when applicable  the company adjusts tax expense to reflect both favorable and unfavorable examination results 
the company s ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of examinations and related tax positions require judgement and can materially increase or decrease its effective rate as well as impact operating results 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  fin is effective for all enterprises with variable interests in variable interest entities created after january  fin r  which was revised in december  is effective for all entities to which the provision of fin were not applied as of december  the provision of fin r must be applied to all entities subject to fin from the beginning of the first quarter of if an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity vie  it must be consolidated by the enterprise that absorbs the majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
the objective of fin is not to restrict the use of variable interest entities but to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities 
until now  a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the company has not entered into any material arrangements with variable interest entities created after january  the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin for any variable interest entities created prior to february  will have on its results of operations and financial condition
