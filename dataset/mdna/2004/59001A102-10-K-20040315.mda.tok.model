item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading designer and builder of single family homes in the rapidly growing sunbelt states of texas  arizona  california and nevada based on the number of home closings 
we focus on providing a broad range of first time  move up  active adult and luxury homes to our targeted customer base 
we believe that the relatively strong population  job and income growth as well as the favorable migration characteristics of our markets will continue to provide significant growth opportunities for us 
at december  we were actively selling homes in communities  with base prices ranging from  to  we achieved record home closings  home sales  revenues and net earnings in home closing revenue increased in to billion and net earnings increased to million 
in addition  in we closed  homes  up from and we received  new orders for homes  up from at december   we have  homes in backlog with a value of million 
in general  we focus on minimizing land risk by purchasing property only after full entitlements have been obtained and typically begin development or construction immediately after close 
we acquire land primarily through rolling option contracts  allowing us to purchase individual lots as our building needs dictate 
these arrangements allow us to control lot inventory typically on a non recourse basis without incurring the risks of land ownership or financial commitments other than relatively small non refundable deposits 
at december   we owned or had options to acquire approximately  housing lots  of which more than eighty percent were under rolling option and land purchase contracts 
we believe that the lots we own or have the right to acquire represent approximately a five year supply  and that we are well positioned for future growth 
see recent accounting standards 
we have completed four acquisitions over the last four years  including our january acquisition of citation homes of southern california 
our recent acquisitions have provided us with an entry into important new markets 
our october acquisition of perma bilt provided us entry into the fast growing las vegas market and our january acquisition of citation homes of southern california provided us entry into the los angeles metro area market  which is the second largest single family housing market in the united states 
our acquisition of hancock phoenix and tucson and our acquisition of hammonds dallas  houston and austin have strengthened our positions in our important arizona and texas markets 
during  we increased the size of our unsecured credit facility to million from million and extended its maturity by months to may in addition  we enhanced our liquidity by completing two add on offerings of our senior notes due  which totaled million in aggregate principal amount 
at december   our unused commitment under our unsecured credit facility was million  of which million was available to borrow 
we believe these financings will support our continued growth and our ability to execute selective acquisitions 
this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation and presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
our significant policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and revenue and costs 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates we use and believe to be critical to our business are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our judgments and assumptions on an on going basis 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we have made  actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us  and involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  include our estimates of costs to complete our individual projects  the ultimate recoverability or impairment of these costs  goodwill impairment  the likelihood of closing lots held under option or contract  the ability to determine the fair value of consolidated real estate not owned and liabilities related to such  certain estimates and assumptions related to implementing fin and fin r  and the ability to estimate expenses and accruals  including legal and warranty reserves 
should we under or over estimate costs to complete individual projects  gross margins in a particular period could be misstated and the ultimate recoverability of costs related to a project from home sales may be uncertain 
furthermore  non refundable deposits paid for land options or contracts may have no economic value to us if we do not ultimately purchase the land 
our inability to accurately estimate expenses  accruals  or an impairment of real estate or goodwill could result in charges  or income  in future periods  which relate to activities or transactions in a preceding period 
the estimates and assumptions we make relating to our implementation of fin r  if not accurate  could result in us incorrectly including  or excluding  respectively  certain contractual land acquisition arrangements as variable interest entities in  or from  respectively  our consolidated financial statements

home closing revenue in increased over  resulting primarily from a increase in the number of homes closed and a increase in the average sales price year over year 
we benefited from an increase in the number of communities that closed homes  from continued strong demand for homes and from an overall increase in the us home ownership rate in  which was at an all time high of at the end of the year 
the number of home closings in texas increased to  from  mainly representing the full year impact of our mid year hammonds acquisition 
while the slower demand experienced in both our austin and monterey phoenix divisions in stabilized in  the number of home closings in california was up in  resulting from the strong california homebuilding market and an increase in actively selling communities 
the number of homes closed in nevada increased from to  due to the full year impact in of our fourth quarter acquisition of perma bilt 
somewhat offsetting these increases was a reduction in the number of home closings in arizona of  due to the earlier than anticipated sell out of some communities and delays in opening their replacements 
also contributing to the increase in home closing revenue was the overall increase in the average home closing price  resulting from the mix of homes closed including more higher priced homes  particularly in california 
as a whole  we benefited from positive demographic factors  historically high home ownership rates  low mortgage interest rates and generally low unemployment figures 
the increases in total home sales revenue in compared to resulted mainly from a increase in the number of homes closed and an increase in our average sales price from  in to  in the number of closings increased as a result of continued growth in our mid priced communities in arizona and growth from the acquisitions of hammonds and perma bilt 
our texas closings in included hammonds homes 
these increases were offset to some degree by decreases in closings in our austin division due to an overall weaker economy in that market and in our monterey phoenix division because of a slowing in demand for our luxury priced homes 
home orders 
home orders for any period represent the aggregate sales price of all homes ordered by customers  net of cancellations 
we do not include orders contingent upon the sale of a customer s existing home as a sales contract until the contingency is removed 
historically  we have experienced a cancellation rate of approximately of gross sales  which we believe is consistent with industry norms 
the dollar value of sales contracts in increased over this increase was driven by a increase in the number of new home orders and a increase in average selling price 
the number of new home orders increased by in texas  a portion of which represents the full year impact of our hammonds acquisition 
the number of orders in arizona increased during  primarily the result of a increase in actively selling communities and continued strong demand for homes 
the number of orders in california was relatively stable  up over  reflecting the earlier than anticipated sellout of communities in the beginning of however  the number of orders was up in the fourth quarter of in california versus the prior year s fourth quarter  due to the introduction of new communities during the second half of new home orders increased in nevada from in to in  as a result of the full year impact of our perma bilt acquisition 
we believe the demand for our homes can be attributed in part to the continuing maturation of first and second generation baby boomers  increases in immigration in the south and west  and a constricting supply of land available for single family housing 
contributing to the increase in sales contracts for the year from the previous year were the addition of the hammonds and perma bilt operations along with strong markets in the number of new orders in texas during includes orders from our hammonds operations 
we saw declines in new orders in our monterey phoenix and austin divisions in  which we believe is due to a slowing in demand for luxury homes in phoenix and a weaker local economy in austin 
order backlog 
backlog represents net sales contracts that have not closed 
total dollar backlog at december  increased over the amount due to a increase in the number of homes in backlog and a increase in the average sales price of those homes 
unit backlog was up in arizona and in california due to an increase in the number of communities and continued strong demand for homes during from year end to year end  the number of active communities in arizona and california increased and  respectively 
unit backlog in nevada increased at the end of  and the average home price in backlog increased due to a shift in product mix  resulting in the dollar value of backlog increasing by in nevada 
unit backlog in texas on december  was relatively in line with december   up 
however  the average selling price in backlog in texas increased  resulting in the dollar value of backlog increasing year over year 
total dollar backlog at december  increased over the amount due to a increase in the number of homes in backlog  and an increase in the average sales prices of those homes 
the increase in the number of homes in backlog at december  resulted mainly from our hammonds and perma bilt acquisitions  which contributed homes with a sales value of approximately million to our december  backlog 
backlog in our monterey phoenix and austin divisions decreased in due to a slowing in demand for luxury homes in phoenix and a weaker local economy in austin 
other operating information years ended december  in thousands home closing gross profit dollars percent of home closing revenue commissions and other sales costs dollars percent of home closing revenue general and administrative expenses dollars percent of total revenue income taxes dollars percent of earnings before income taxes home closing gross profit 
home closinggross profit represents home closing revenue less cost of home closings 
cost of home closings include developed lot costs  direct home construction costs  an allocation of common community costs such as model complex costs and architectural  legal and zoning costs  interest  sales tax  warranty  construction overhead and closing costs 
home closing gross profit was of home closing revenue in  up from in the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to the absence of purchase accounting adjustments relating to the hammonds and perma bilt acquisitions  which  combined  amounted to million in home closing prices increased at a greater rate than cost of home closings  also contributing to the gross margin improvement 
average home closing prices were up in while the average cost of home closings increased only 
the dollar increase in gross profit for the year ended december  over is attributable to a increase in home closing revenue during the gross profit margin on home closings decreased to in  primarily due to the effect of writing up certain assets acquired in conjunction with purchase accounting for the hammonds and perma bilt acquisitions  which  combined  effectively increased cost of home closings by million in we also experienced a decrease in gross profit margin on home closings in due to the lower margins generally achieved by hammonds in comparison to the company as a whole  and to increased competitive pressures in some of our markets 
land closings 
the sale of land is not a significant component of our business plan and takes place sporadically 
incidental sales of land may continue in the future  but could fluctuate substantially up or down 
a summary of lot and land sales is presented below years ended december  in thousands land closing revenue cost of land closings land closing gross profit commissions and other sales costs 
commissions and other sales costs  such as advertising and sales office expenses  were of home closing revenue in  up from in this increase was primarily the result of the rising use of independent brokers who are paid higher commissions than our employee brokers  along with costs associated with opening new communities for sale 
our marketing expenses are incurred in connection with the promotion of a new community  and these expenses are often incurred in advance of actual home closings  which tend to lag the preceding sale by a period of four to nine months 
commissions and other sales costs were approximately million  or of home closing revenue in  as compared to approximately million  or of home closing revenue in the higher commissions and sales costs in resulted primarily from a greater number of new communities added that year 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses represent corporate and divisional overhead expenses such as salaries and bonuses  occupancy  insurance  and travel expenses 
general and administrative costs as a percent of total revenue for and were consistent at for each year 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million  or of total revenue in  as compared to approximately million  or of total revenue in the lower expense as a percentage of total revenue in in comparison to resulted partly from the june end to the california earn out payment per the terms of the purchase contract when we acquired the division 
the earn out was based on of the pre tax earnings of the northern california region after reduction for a capital charge 
company wide  we were also able to benefit from expanding revenue while holding down increases in overhead costs 
income taxes 
income taxes increased to million in from million in as a percent of pre tax earnings  taxes were in  down from in this reduction was mainly due to the increase in pre tax earnings in texas and nevada  which have minimal or no state taxes  as a percent of total pre tax earnings 
also  the tax benefit related to the exercise of employee stock options reduced taxes currently payable by approximately million  resulting in a more favorable tax rate 
this benefit was credited to paid in capital 
the increase in income taxes to million for the year ended december   from million in the prior year resulted from an increase in pre tax income 
the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options reduced taxes payable for by approximately million  which resulted in a more favorable tax rate 
the tax benefit was credited to additional paid in capital 
liquidity and capital resources our principal uses of capital for the year ended december  were for operating expenses  land and property purchases  lot development  home construction  the repurchase of common stock  income taxes  interest and investments in joint ventures 
we used a combination of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and funds generated by operations to meet our short term working capital requirements 
cash flows for each of our communities depends on the status of the development cycle  and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions  plat and other approvals  and construction of model homes  roads  utilities  general landscaping and other amenities 
because these costs are capitalized  income reported for financial statement purposes during those early stages may significantly exceed cash flow 
future cash flows may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as cost of sales includes charges for substantial amounts of previously expended costs 
we enter into various options and purchase contracts for land as a normal course of business 
except for our specific performance options  none of these agreements require us to purchase lots 
generally  our options to purchase lots remain effective so long as we purchase a pre established minimum number of lots each month or quarter  as determined by the respective agreement 
the pre established number is typically structured to approximate our expected rate of home construction starts 
at december   we had entered into purchase agreements with an aggregate purchase price of billion  on which we had made deposits of approximately million in cash along with approximately million in letters of credit 
additional information regarding our purchase agreements and related deposits is presented in note variable interest entities and consolidated real estate not owned in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in december we increased the committed balance of our unsecured credit facility by million  raising the total commitment to million 
the facility is with a consortium of banks  led by guaranty bank and bank one  na 
the revised agreement also lengthened the term of the facility by months  extending the maturity date to may  and expanded the number of banks participating in the facility from seven to ten 
at december   there was a balance of million outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and approximately million was outstanding in letters of credit that collateralize our obligations under various land purchase and other contracts 
after considering our most restrictive bank covenants  our borrowing availability under the bank credit facility was approximately million at december   as determined by borrowing base limitations defined by our agreement with the lending banks 
this credit facility contains certain financial and other covenants  including covenants requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of at least million plus of net income earned since january  plus of the aggregate net increase in tangible net worth resulting from the sale of capital stock and other equity interests as defined  prohibiting our ratio of indebtedness including accrued expenses to tangible net worth from being greater than to  requiring us to maintain a ratio of ebitda including interest amortized to cost of sales to interest incurred as defined of at least to  prohibiting the net book value of our land and lots where construction of a home has not commenced to exceed of tangible net worth and prohibiting the net book value of our raw land where grading or infrastructure improvements have not begun to exceed of tangible net worth  limiting the number of unsold housing units and model units that we may have in our inventory at the end of any fiscal quarter as follows unsold homes cannot exceed of the number of home closings within the four fiscal quarters ending on such date  and model homes cannot exceed of the number of home closings within the four fiscal quarters ending on such date  and prohibiting us from entering into any sale and leaseback transaction  excluding the sale and leaseback of model homes and prohibiting us from creating or incurring any off balance sheet liability 
for purposes of our credit facility  off balance sheet liabilities include certain liabilities arising under asset securitization transactions  monetary obligations under synthetic leases  tax retention or off balance sheet lease transactions that upon the application of any debtor relief law to us would be characterized as indebtedness  any other monetary obligation with respect to any transaction which upon the application of any debtor relief law to us would be characterized as indebtedness or which is the functional equivalent of or takes the place of borrowing but which does not constitute a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
notwithstanding the above  our credit facility specifically provides that liabilities i under rolling options and similar contracts for the acquisition of real property and ii arising under model home leases shall not be deemed off balance sheet liabilities 
in may  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due approximately million of this offering was used to complete the acquisition of hancock  approximately million was used to pay down existing bank debt  approximately million was used to pay costs related to the senior notes offering and approximately million was used to repay previously existing senior notes 
this early repayment of debt resulted in prepayment fees of approximately  which  net of the related income tax benefit  resulted in a loss of approximately  in the second quarter of  which is reported as general and administrative expense and income tax benefit to conform with the requirement of sfas  which was effective january  in september  we purchased and retired million in principal amount of our outstanding senior notes 
the purchases were made at of par at a gain of approximately  which net of related income tax effect of  resulted in a net gain of  through add on financings  in february we increased our senior notes due by approximately million including premium of million and in september we increased our senior notes by approximately million including premium of million  the proceeds of which were used to pay down our senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
our senior notes require us to comply with a number of covenants that restrict certain transactions  including covenants limiting the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur unless after giving effect to such additional indebtedness  either i our fixed charge coverage ratio would be at least to or ii our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth would be less than to  provided  however  this limitation does not apply to most types of inter company indebtedness  purchase money indebtedness up to million  non recourse indebtedness and other indebtedness up to million  generally limiting the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make to million plus i of our net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of at least million  limiting our ability to incur or create certain liens  and placing limitations on the sale of assets  mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates 
as of and for the year ended december   we were in compliance with the credit facility and senior note covenants 
we believe that our current borrowing capacity  cash on hand at december   and anticipated net cash flows from operations are and will be sufficient to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we believe our future cash needs will include funds for the completion of projects that are underway  the maintenance of our day to day operations  and the acquisition or start up of additional homebuilding operations  should the opportunities arise 
there is no assurance  however  that future cash flows will be sufficient to meet future capital needs 
the amount and types of indebtedness that we incur may be limited by the terms of the indenture governing our senior notes and by the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility 
in august  our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
no date for completing the program has been determined  but we will purchase shares subject to applicable securities laws  and at times and in amounts as management deems appropriate 
by december   we had purchased  shares of our common stock under the august program at an average price of per share 
off balance sheet arrangements we often acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements 
this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development 
under these purchase agreements  we are usually required to make deposits in the form of cash or letters of credit  which may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement 
at december   we had entered into purchase agreements with an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion  by making deposits of approximately million in the form of cash and approximately million in letters of credit 
we also obtain letters of credit and performance  maintenance  and other bonds in support of our related obligations with respect to the development of our projects 
the amount of these obligations outstanding at any time varies depending on the stage and level of our development activities 
in the event the letters of credit or bonds are drawn upon  we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit or bond 
at december   we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit and million in performance bonds for such purposes 
we believe it is unlikely that any of these letters of credit or bonds will be drawn upon 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period more less than than total year years years years principal  senior notes interest  senior notes revolving construction facilities other borrowing obligations operating lease obligations specific performance option obligations total we do not engage in commodity trading or other similar activities 
we had no derivative financial instruments at december  or as a part of our model home construction activities  we enter into lease transactions with third parties  the monthly payments for which are typically calculated by applying the libor rate to the agreed upon basis of the leased asset 
at december   the total lease basis of model homes under these lease agreements  including land and construction costs  was approximately million  all of which is excluded from our balance sheet 
our obligations under these leases are included in the table above within the operating lease obligation category 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding our contractual obligations 
consolidated cash flow our cash and cash equivalents at december  decreased by approximately million from the balance at the end of the prior year 
this decrease reflects a net usage of cash in operating activities of approximately million  compared with million provided in net cash used for operating activities in was million 
the increase in cash used in operations in resulted mainly from increased purchases of real estate to be used in our homebuilding operations 
the change in cash provided of million in compared to million used in resulted mainly from the million increase in net earnings 
we used cash in investing activities of million in  mainly for purchases of property and equipment and investments in unconsolidated entities  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in over was primarily due to our acquisition of hammonds and perma bilt  which used cash of approximately million 
financing activities generated cash of million in and million in in  we issued additional senior notes of million  an increase that was offset by net repayments of our loans payable of million and approximately million used for repurchases of our common stock 
in we generated million in cash 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities in resulted mainly from the proceeds from the sale of our common stock in a public offering  offset by increased purchases of treasury shares 
other events as widely reported in the media  in the third quarter of  a gasoline pipeline located under the common area of one of our tucson communities ruptured  spraying five homes under construction with gasoline but causing no personal injuries 
at the time of the rupture  all lots in the community were under contract to homebuyers  but no homes were completed at that time and the community was unoccupied 
as a consequence of this rupture  the five affected homes were demolished  and we offered all buyers in the affected community the right to cancel their purchase contracts  resulting in a net cancellation of approximately sales some cancelled contracts were replaced by new buyers 
we believe the owner of the pipeline a fortune company is responsible for and will pay for substantially all damages and losses we incur relating to this incident 
at this time  we are in continuing discussions with the pipeline owner to resolve outstanding issues 
closings of homes in this community have been delayed as a result of the ongoing investigation and remediation of the damage caused by the rupture and related issues 
at december   we had incurred approximately  related to this incident  substantially all of which we expect to recover in seasonality we historically close more homes in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half  due in part to the slightly seasonal nature of the market for our move up and luxury products 
we expect this seasonal trend to continue  although it may vary as our operations continue to expand 
recent accounting standards in january  sfas no 
rescission of sfas no 
   and amendment of sfas no 
and technical corrections became effective 
sfas no 
prevents gains or losses on the extinguishment of debt not meeting the criteria of apb no 
from being treated as an extraordinary item 
we adopted sfas no 
in january  and as a result  the pretax charge of  recorded in as an extraordinary loss has been reclassified to general and administrative expenses  net of the related tax benefit 
recently  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which governs whether certain transactions should be accounted for as on or off balance sheet transactions 
our adoption of fin r could affect our accounting methods and the way we conduct our land acquisition activities 
we have the right to acquire a substantial amount of lot inventory through rolling options and purchase agreements with third parties and  to a lesser extent  joint ventures 
historically  our rolling options and similar contractual arrangements to acquire lot inventory have not been reflected on our balance sheet 
based upon current interpretations of fin r  in connection with substantially all of our land purchase transactions  we will need to obtain certifications from sellers that the property we have contracted to acquire represents less than half of the fair value of the total assets held by the seller 
if we cannot obtain such a certification  we would then be required to obtain confidential financial information from the seller about the seller s ownership structure  financing sources  its other assets and liabilities  and its general business and operations 
this information would be used to evaluate whether the selling entity should be consolidated into our financial statements based upon tests designed to determine if we have a majority economic even if not legal interest in the entity and  if so  determine how the seller s assets and liabilities are to be consolidated into our financial statements 
although land banking and purchase arrangements entered into prior to december  are exempt from these information requirements  provided exhaustive efforts have been made to obtain such information  land transactions entered into in the first quarter of and forward must satisfy these standards 
for transactions entered into prior to  we have made exhaustive efforts to obtain relevant information and we will continue to make similar efforts in future periods as required 
we are currently in the process of contacting property owners that in the first quarter of entered into contractual arrangements to sell us property to obtain the relevant certifications and information to satisfy these standards 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to obtain such information on a timely basis 
to the extent we are unable to obtain relevant information from sellers  we anticipate that we would either purchase the lots and land subject to these option agreements  cancel these option agreements and write off any earnest money or option deposits related to them  or sell and assign our interest in these option agreements to an independent third party 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that the impact on our business and financial position of either purchasing the lots and land subject to these option agreements or canceling these option agreements would not be material 
in the future  we intend to limit most of our transactions to sellers than can supply the necessary certifications or required financial information to us 
factors that may affect our future results and financial condition future operating results and financial condition depend on our ability to successfully design  develop  construct and sell homes that satisfy dynamic customer demand patterns 
inherent in this process are factors that we must successfully manage to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
these operating and financial factors  along with many other factors  could affect the price of our common stock and notes 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results and financial condition could include the factors discussed below 
homebuilding industry factors 
the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in economic and other conditions such as employment levels  availability of financing  interest rates  and consumer confidence 
these factors can negatively affect demand for  cost of and pricing of our homes 
we are subject to various risks  many of which are outside of our control  including delays in construction schedules  cost overruns  changes in governmental regulations such as no or slow growth initiatives  increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees  and raw materials and labor costs 
we are also subject to the potential for significant variability and fluctuations in the cost and availability of real estate 
although historically we have generally developed parcels ranging from to lots  in order to achieve and maintain an adequate inventory of lots  we are beginning to purchase larger parcels  in some cases with a joint venture partner 
write downs of our real estate could occur if market conditions deteriorate and these write downs could be material in amount 
write downs may also occur if we purchase land at higher prices during stronger economic periods and the value of that land subsequently declines during slower economic periods 
home warranty factors 
construction defect and home warranty claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly 
while we maintain product liability insurance and generally require our subcontractors and design professionals to indemnify us for liabilities arising from their work  we cannot assure you that these insurance rights and indemnities will be adequate to cover all construction defect and warranty claims for which we may be held liable 
for example  we may be responsible for applicable self insured retentions  which have increased recently  and certain claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits 
increased insurance costs 
recently  lawsuits have been filed against builders asserting claims of personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential dwellings 
some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements 
we believe that we have maintained adequate insurance coverage to insure against these types of claims for homes completed before october  insurance carriers have been excluding claims from policies arising from the presence of mold for many builders and  as of october   our insurance policy began excluding mold coverage 
we believe we have sufficient retentions to protect against these types of claims related to homes completed after september  if our retentions are not sufficient to protect against these types of claims or if we are unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage  a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations could result if we are exposed to claims arising from the presence of mold in the homes that we sell 
partially as a result of the september  terrorist attacks  the cost of insurance has risen  deductibles or retentions have increased significantly  and the availability of insurance has diminished 
significant increases in our cost of insurance coverage or retentions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in operating results 
we historically have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  variability in home sales and net earnings on a quarterly basis 
as a result of such variability  our historical performance may not be a meaningful indicator of future results 
factors that contribute to this variability include timing of home deliveries and land closings  our ability to acquire additional land or options for additional land on acceptable terms  conditions of the real estate market in areas where we operate and of the general economy  the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry  changes in prevailing interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing  costs and availability of materials and labor  and delays in construction schedules due to strikes  adverse weather  acts of god  reduced subcontractor availability and governmental restrictions 
interest rates and mortgage financing 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing costs and the unavailability of mortgage financing 
most of our buyers finance their home purchases through third party lenders providing mortgage financing 
if mortgage interest rates increase and  consequently  the ability of prospective buyers to finance home purchases is adversely affected  home sales  gross margins and cash flow may also be adversely affected and the impact may be material 
interest rates are currently near historically low levels  however  it is impossible to predict future increases or decreases in market interest rates 
in addition  homebuilding activities depend upon the availability and costs of mortgage financing for buyers of homes owned by potential customers  as those customers move up buyers often must sell their residences before they purchase our homes 
any reduction of financing availability could adversely affect home sales 
competition 
the homebuilding industry is highly competitive 
we compete for sales in each of our markets with national  regional and local developers and homebuilders  existing home resales and  to a lesser extent  condominiums and available rental housing 
if we are unable to successfully compete  our financial results and growth could suffer 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources or lower costs than we do 
competition among both small and large residential homebuilders is based on a number of interrelated factors  including location  reputation  amenities  design  quality and price 
competition is expected to continue and become more intense  and there may be new entrants in the markets in which we currently operate and in markets we may enter in the future 
lack of geographic diversification 
we have operations in texas  arizona  california and nevada 
our lack of geographic diversification could adversely impact us if the homebuilding business in our current markets should decline  since there may not be a balancing opportunity in a stronger market in other geographic regions 
additional financing  limitations 
the homebuilding industry is capital intensive and requires significant up front expenditures to acquire land and begin development 
accordingly  we incur substantial indebtedness to finance our homebuilding activities 
at december   we had approximately million of indebtedness 
if we require working capital greater than that provided by operations or available under our credit facility  we may be required to seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources  including bank financing and securities offerings 
the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes such as capital expenditures  we have a higher level of indebtedness than some of our competitors  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing conditions in our industry  including increased competition  and we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
we expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations 
our ability to meet our expenses thus depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic and other factors 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors 
we cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations 
if we do not have sufficient funds  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets or borrow additional funds 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives 
operating and financial limitations 
the indenture for our senior notes and the agreement for our senior unsecured credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions limit our ability  among other things  to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  repurchase our stock  make investments  sell assets  enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  enter into transactions with affiliates  and consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  the indentures for our senior notes and our senior unsecured credit facility require us to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and our credit facility requires us to maintain other specified financial ratios 
we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to pursue available business opportunities 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness 
if a default occurs  the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable 
government regulations  environmental conditions 
regulatory requirements could cause us to incur significant liabilities and costs and could restrict our business activities 
we are subject to local  state and federal statutes and rules regulating certain developmental matters  as well as building and site design 
we are subject to various fees and charges of government authorities designed to defray the cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements 
we may be subject to additional costs and delays or may be precluded entirely from building projects because of no growth or slow growth initiatives  building permit ordinances  building moratoriums  or similar government regulations that could be imposed in the future due to health  safety  welfare or environmental concerns 
we must also obtain licenses  permits and approvals from government agencies to engage in certain activities  the granting or receipt of which are beyond our control  but could cause delays in our homebuilding projects 
we are also subject to a variety of local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment 
environmental laws or permit restrictions may result in project delays  may cause substantial compliance and other costs and may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or geographic areas 
environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials  such as lumber 
future expansion 
we may continue to consider growth or expansion of our operations in our current markets or in other areas of the country 
our expansion into new or existing markets could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or profitability 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future expansion will depend on a number of factors  including suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
new acquisitions may result in the incurrence of additional debt 
acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired company s operations  the incurrence of unanticipated liabilities or expenses  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
dependence on key personnel 
our success largely depends on the continuing services of certain key employees  including our co chief executive officers  steven j 
hilton and john r 
landon  and our continued favorable development depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
we have employment agreements with messrs 
hilton and landon  but we do not have employment agreements with certain other key employees 
we believe that messrs 
hilton and landon each possess valuable industry knowledge  experience  and leadership abilities that would be difficult in the short term to replicate 
the loss of the services of key employees could harm our operations and business plans 
dependence on subcontractors 
we conduct our construction operations only as a general contractor 
virtually all architectural and construction work is performed by unaffiliated third party subcontractors 
as a consequence  we depend on the continued availability of and satisfactory performance by these subcontractors for the design and construction of our homes 
we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient availability of and satisfactory performance by these unaffiliated third party subcontractors 
in addition  inadequate subcontractor resources could have a material adverse affect on our business 
inflation 
we  like other homebuilders  may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  mainly because of higher land and construction costs 
also  higher mortgage interest rates may have a significant adverse effect on the affordability of mortgage financing to prospective buyers 
inflation increases our cost of financing  materials and labor and could cause our financial results or growth to decline 
we attempt to pass cost increases on to our customers through higher sales prices 
to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations  however  inflation could impact our future operating results 
natural disasters 
we have significant homebuilding operations in texas and california 
some of our markets in texas occasionally experience extreme weather conditions such as tornadoes or hurricanes 
california has experienced a significant number of earthquakes  flooding  landslides and other natural disasters in recent years 
we do not insure against some of these risks 
these occurrences could damage or destroy some of our homes under construction or our building lots  which may result in losses that exceed our insurance coverage 
we could also suffer significant construction delays or substantial fluctuations in the pricing or availability of building materials 
any of these events could cause a decrease in our revenue  cash flows and earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements 
the fasb recently issued fin r  which governs variable interest entities in a way that impacts our ability to use rolling option contracts and even long term purchase agreements to control land for future development 
in order to maintain these interests as off balance sheet  as we have historically done  we will need to structure our transactions differently than we have in the past  and will need to limit transactions to sellers that meet certain requirements  some of which could impact our ability to buy land 
in addition  we may need to record more land and corresponding liabilities on our balance sheet  which may negatively affect how lenders and investors perceive our financial condition 
some of our transactions in the first quarter of may not  at the present time  satisfy off balance sheet treatment 
in such cases  we anticipate that we would either purchase the lots and land subject to these option agreements and write off any earnest money or option deposits related to them  cancel the agreements and forfeit our related earnest money or option deposits  or sell and assign our interest in these option agreements to an independent third party 
we do not believe that these actions  if taken  would have a material adverse impact on our financial results or financial position  but there can be no assurance in this regard 
acts of war 
acts of war or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the united states and any foreign power  including the armed conflict with iraq  may cause disruption to the economy  our company  our employees and our customers  which could impact our revenue  costs and expenses and financial condition 
special note of caution regarding forward looking statements in passing the private securities litigation reform act of pslra  congress encouraged public companies to make forward looking statements by creating a safe harbor to protect companies from securities law liability in connection with forward looking statements 
we intend to qualify both our written and oral forward looking statements for protection under the pslra 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  forecast  plan  and project and similar expressions identify forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date the statement was made 
all statements other than of historical fact are forward looking statements and are within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities act of  and section e of the exchange act 
forward looking statements in this annual report and form k include statements concerning the demand for and the pricing of our homes  the growth potential of the markets we operate in  our acquisition strategy  positive demographic and other trends related to the homebuilding industry in general and our ability to capitalize on them  the future supply of housing inventory in our markets and the homebuilding industry in general  the number of communities we expect to open for sales in certain markets in  our perceptions of the current and future valuation of homebuilding companies  our ability to renew existing leases on comparable terms  our expectation that existing letters of credit and performance bonds will not be drawn on  our expectation that our costs and expenses relating to a ruptured pipeline under one of our tucson subdivisions will be paid by the owner of the pipeline  the adequacy of our insurance coverage and warranty reserves  our ability to deliver existing backlog  the expected outcome of legal proceedings against us  the sufficiency of our capital resources to support our growth strategy  the impact of new accounting standards  particularly fin r the future realizability of deferred tax assets  the expectation of continued positive operating results in and beyond and the expected benefits of our acquisitions 
such statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
important factors currently known to management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements  and that could negatively affect our business are discussed in this report under the heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect our future results and financial condition 
forward looking statements express expectations of future events 
all forward looking statements are inherently uncertain as they are based on various expectations and assumptions concerning future events and they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected 
due to these inherent uncertainties  the investment community is urged not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
in addition  we undertake no obligations to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of anticipated events or changes to projections over time 
as a result of these and other factors  our stock and note prices may fluctuate dramatically 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates on our existing revolving credit facility 
the interest rate relative to this borrowing fluctuates with the prime and eurodollar lending rates 
as of december   we had approximately million drawn under our revolving credit facility that is subject to changes in interest rates 
an increase or decrease of in interest rates would change our annual debt service payments by approximately  per year 
we do not enter into  or intend to enter into  derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our fixed rate debt is made up primarily of our million in principal of our senior notes 
except in limited circumstances  we do not have an obligation to prepay our fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate borrowings until we would be required to refinance such debt 
the following table presents our debt obligations  principal cash flows by maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value 
for the year ended december  dollars in millions thereafter total fair value at long term debt fixed rate b average interest rate n a variable rate c average interest rate a n a a prime or libor plus 
b fair value of our fixed rate debt at december   is based on quoted market prices by independent dealers 
c our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate which is comparable to current market rates  therefore the cost basis approximates fair value 
our operations are interest rate sensitive 
as overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates  a significant increase in mortgage interest rates may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing 
higher interest rates could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and net income and would also increase our variable rate borrowing costs
