item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview covance is a leading drug development services company providing a wide range of early stage and late stage product development services on a worldwide basis primarily to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries 
covance also provides services such as laboratory testing to the chemical  agrochemical and food industries 
the foregoing services comprise two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes early development services  which includes preclinical and phase i clinical service offerings  and late stage development services  which includes central laboratory  clinical development  periapproval  central ecg diagnostic services  and health care economic and reimbursement services 
although each segment has separate services within it  they can be combined in joint service offerings and we believe clients increasingly are interested in the opportunities for such combined services 
covance believes it is one of the largest drug development services companies  based on annual net revenues  and one of a few that is capable of providing comprehensive global product development services 
covance offers its clients high quality services designed to provide data to clients as rapidly as possible and reduce product development time 
we believe this enables covance s customers to introduce their products into the marketplace faster and as a result  maximize the period of market exclusivity and monetary return on their research and development investments 
additionally  covance s comprehensive services and broad experience provide its customers with a variable cost alternative to fixed cost internal development capabilities 
critical accounting policies covance s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
covance recognizes revenue either as services are performed or products are delivered  depending upon the nature of the work contracted 
historically  a majority of covance s net revenues have been earned under contracts which range in duration from a few months to two years  but can extend in duration up to five years or longer 
service contracts generally take the form of fee for service or fixed price arrangements 
in the case of fee for service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are performed  based upon  for example  hours worked or samples tested 
for long term fixed price service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are performed  with performance generally assessed using output measures  such as units of work performed to date as compared to the total units of work contracted 
changes in the scope of work generally result in a renegotiation of contract pricing terms 
renegotiated amounts are not included in net revenues until earned and realization is assured 
estimates of costs to complete are made to provide  where appropriate  for losses expected on contracts 
costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded  but instead are expensed as incurred 
in some cases  for multi year contracts  a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the trial is initiated 
these advances are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed  as discussed above 
additional payments may be made based upon the achievement of performance based milestones over the contract duration 
most contracts are terminable by the client either immediately or upon notice 
these contracts typically require payment to covance of expenses to wind down the study  fees earned to date and  in some cases  a termination fee or a payment to covance of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by covance under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
termination fees are included in net revenues when realization is assured 
bad debts 
covance endeavors to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the ordinary course of business 
covance maintains a provision for doubtful accounts to provide for the possibility that amounts due covance may not be collected 
this bad debt provision is monitored on a monthly basis and adjusted as circumstances warrant 
since the recorded bad debt provision is based upon management s judgment  actual bad debt write offs may be greater or less than the amount recorded 
historically bad debt write offs have not been material 
taxes on income 
since covance conducts operations on a global basis  its effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of its pre tax earnings among locations with varying tax rates 
covance s profits are further impacted by changes in the tax rates of the various jurisdictions 
in particular  as the geographic mix of covance s pre tax earnings among various tax jurisdictions changes  covance s effective tax rate may vary from period to period 
covance has established  and periodically reevaluates  an estimated income tax reserve on its consolidated balance sheet to provide for the possibility of adverse outcomes in income tax proceedings 
while covance believes that it has identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve it has established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances  it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures will be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
it is possible that changes in estimates in the future could cause covance to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of its income tax reserve 
in addition  covance s policy is to provide income taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the extent those earnings are taxable or are expected to be remitted 
taxes have not been provided on accumulated foreign unremitted earnings totaling million as of december  because covance currently intends to leave these earnings invested in those countries 
if covance were to repatriate these earnings  or a portion of these earnings  covance might incur a significant income tax liability 
stock based compensation 
covance grants stock options to its employees at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant and accounts for these stock option grants in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
under apb  when stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the income statement 
impairment of assets 
covance reviews its long lived assets for impairment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based upon covance s judgment of its ability to recover the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations 
actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated 
covance performs an annual test for impairment of goodwill 
this test is performed by comparing  at the reporting unit level  the carrying value of goodwill to its fair value 
covance assesses fair value based upon its best estimate of the present value of the future cash flows that it expects to be generated by the reporting unit 
the test performed for did not identify any instances of impairment 
however  changes in expectations as to the present value of the reporting unit s future cash flows might impact subsequent years assessments of impairment 
defined benefit pension plans 
covance sponsors defined benefit pension plans for the benefit of its employees at three foreign subsidiaries 
the measurement of the related pension benefit obligation and the expense recorded in each year is based upon actuarial computations which require judgment as to a the appropriate discount rate to use in computing the present value of the benefit obligation  b the expected return on plan assets and c the expected future rate of salary increases 
actual results will likely differ  in some periods materially  from the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation 
foreign currency risks since covance operates on a global basis  it is exposed to various foreign currency risks 
two specific risks arise from the nature of the contracts covance executes with its customers since from time to time contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular covance subsidiary s local currency 
these risks are generally applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by covance s foreign subsidiaries providing clinical services 
the first risk occurs as revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the subsidiary s expenses are incurred 
as a result  the subsidiary s net revenues and resultant earnings can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
historically  fluctuations in exchange rates from those in effect at the time contracts were executed have not had a material effect upon covance s consolidated financial results 
see risk factors 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  covance recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared and payment from the customer is received will result in covance receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by covance as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other expense income in covance s consolidated statements of income 
foreign currency transaction losses for the year ended december  were million 
finally  covance s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting covance s consolidated financial results 
the process by which each foreign subsidiary s financial results are translated into us dollars is as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the stockholders equity account  referred to as the cumulative translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
to date such cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to covance s consolidated financial position 
operating expenses and reimbursable out of pockets covance segregates its recurring operating expenses among four categories cost of revenue  reimbursed out of pocket expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
cost of revenue includes direct labor and related benefits  other direct costs  shipping and handling fees  and an allocation of facility charges and information technology costs  and excludes depreciation and amortization 
cost of revenue  as a percentage of net revenues  tends and is expected to fluctuate from one period to another  as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involving hundreds of studies conducted during any period of time 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll and related benefit charges  advertising and promotional expenses  administrative travel and an allocation of facility charges and information technology costs  and excludes depreciation and amortization 
in connection with the management of multi site clinical trials  covance pays on behalf of its customers fees to investigators  volunteers and other out of pocket costs such as for travel  printing  meetings  couriers  etc  for which it is reimbursed at cost  without mark up or profit 
investigator fees are not reflected in total revenues or expenses where covance acts in the capacity of an agent on behalf of the pharmaceutical company sponsor  passing through these costs without risk or reward to covance 
all other out of pocket costs are included in total revenues and expenses 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenues increased to million for from million for excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods  net revenues increased as compared to net revenues from covance s early development segment grew  or excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods  on strong performance in our north american and european toxicology  chemistry and phase i clinical services 
net revenues from covance s late stage development segment increased  but decreased excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods 
growth in our late stage development segment was negatively impacted by a shift in the mix of our phase iv backlog to longer term studies which negatively affected current period net revenues  and also due to weak first half net orders in our central laboratory 
cost of revenue increased to million or of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to million or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
gross margins improved basis points to for the year ended december  from for the corresponding period  on process improvements and cost controls  especially in our central laboratory and across most of our early development service offerings 
overall  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased basis points to for from for depreciation and amortization increased to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for income from operations increased to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
income from operations from covance s early development segment increased million or to million or of net revenues for the year ended december  from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period  primarily driven by strong performance in our north american and european toxicology  chemistry  and phase i services 
income from operations from covance s late stage development segment increased million or to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period  primarily driven by process improvements in our central laboratory and clinical development services  partially offset by softness in our phase iv service offering from lower revenues 
corporate expense increased million to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for other expense  net decreased million to million for from million for the weakening of the us dollar during the year ended december  drove foreign exchange transaction losses totaling million as compared to losses totaling only million for the comparable period 
also contributing to the decrease was a million reduction in net interest expense 
covance s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the corresponding period 
covance s effective tax rate reflects the reversal of a million income tax reserve relating primarily to the favorable settlement of a longstanding multi year foreign income tax audit 
excluding the effect of this adjustment  covance s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
the basis point reduction in covance s effective tax rate during excluding this adjustment is attributable to a number factors  including the mix of our pre tax earnings across various tax jurisdictions  recently enacted research and development tax credits in the united kingdom  and other initiatives 
covance has a minority equity position approximately at december  in bio imaging technologies  inc biti 
biti uses proprietary medical imaging technologies to process and analyze medical images  and also provides other services  including the data basing and regulatory submission of medical images  quantitative data and text 
during the year ended december   covance recognized income of million  representing its pro rata share of biti s earnings 
net income of million for the year ended december  increased million or as compared to million for the corresponding period 
excluding the million income tax reserve reversal discussed above  net income increased million or as compared to the corresponding period 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  the following table presents the results for the years ended december  and on both a gaap and a pro forma basis 
the presentation of pro forma results is intended to assist the reader in analyzing the results for the periods on what management believes to be a more comparable ie  like on like basis 
pro forma adjustments have been made for a million reduction in our income tax reserve and provision recorded in  to reflect the sale of our packaging and biomanufacturing operations as if these transactions had occurred on january   for a restructuring charge totaling million million net of tax recorded in  and for goodwill amortization in totaling million million net of tax  in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

on a pro forma basis  net revenues increased million or from million for excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods  net revenues increased on a pro forma basis  as compared to net revenues from covance s early development segment grew  or excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods  driven primarily by growth in our toxicology service offering 
on a gaap basis  revenue from covance s late stage development segment declined million or to million from million 
on a pro forma basis  excluding the net revenues from the businesses divested in  net revenues from covance s late stage development segment increased  or excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods 
the modest late stage development revenue growth  in part  resulted from our strategy to first improve our operating margins by an increased focus on contract selectivity in our phase ii iii services  and the slower conversion of our backlog to revenue in our central laboratory business during the first half of cost of revenue  decreased to million or of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to million or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
gross margins were for the year ended december   up from for the corresponding period 
the period includes cost of revenue from covance s biomanufacturing and packaging operations totaling million 
on a pro forma basis  cost of revenue in totaled million and gross margins were 
also  the period includes higher investment spending on internet initiatives and lower margins on bioanalytical services 
overall  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for from for the period includes selling  general and administrative expenses from covance s biomanufacturing and packaging operations totaling million 
on a pro forma basis  selling  general and administrative expenses for the period totaled million  or of net revenues 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for  due primarily to the divestiture of our capital intensive biomanufacturing and packaging businesses in the first half of  and the implementation of sfas no 
in the first quarter of  which has eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
depreciation and amortization from our divested biomanufacturing and packaging operations included in the period totaled million 
goodwill amortization included in the period totaled million 
on a pro forma basis  depreciation and amortization increased over income from operations increased to million for from million for the corresponding period 
income from operations from covance s early development segment increased million or to million or of net revenues for the year ended december  from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period  primarily driven by growth in our toxicology services offering 
income from operations from covance s late stage development segment increased million or to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
corporate expenses increased million to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for the increase is primarily attributable to the centralization of information technology infrastructure in and investments made therein  increased marketing and higher variable compensation expenses 
the period includes income from operations from our divested biomanufacturing and packaging operations totaling million  a restructuring charge totaling million and goodwill amortization totaling million 
on a pro forma basis  income from operations increased to million for from million for as a percentage of net revenues on a pro forma basis  income from operations increased to for from for on a pro forma basis  income from operations from covance s early development segment increased million or to million  as compared to million for on a pro forma basis  income from operations from covance s late stage development segment increased million or to million as compared to million for  primarily driven by growth in our toxicology service offering 
the increase in late stage development operating income on a pro forma basis was due to covance s continued focus on margin improvements in our phase ii iii services  increased volume in our phase iii and central laboratory services during the second half of  and margin growth in our commercialization services 
other expense  net for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to other income  net for the period totaling million 
other income  net for the period includes a million net pre tax gain on the sale of our packaging and biomanufacturing operations  offset by interest expense totaling million related to these divested businesses 
on a pro forma basis  other expense  net increased million to million for from million for  due primarily to a million reduction in interest expense resulting from lower weighted average borrowings under our long term credit facility  partially offset by a million increase in foreign exchange transaction losses  as a result of the weakening us dollar 
covance s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the corresponding period 
covance s effective tax rate reflects the reversal of a million income tax reserve due to a change in estimate relating primarily to the favorable settlement of a longstanding multi year foreign income tax audit 
excluding the effect of this adjustment  covance s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
the pro forma effective tax rate for the period was 
net income was million for the year ended december  versus million for net income for the period includes the net after tax impact from the divestiture of our biomanufacturing and packaging operations totaling million  the after tax impact of a restructuring charge totaling million  and the after tax impact of goodwill amortization totaling million 
on a pro forma basis  net income increased or million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the corresponding period 
quarterly results covance s quarterly operating results are subject to variation  and are expected to continue to be subject to variation  as a result of factors such as delays in initiating or completing significant drug development trials  termination or reduction in size of drug development trials  acquisitions and divestitures  and exchange rate fluctuations 
delays and terminations of trials are often the result of actions taken by covance s customers or regulatory authorities and are not typically controllable by covance 
since a large amount of covance s operating costs are relatively fixed while revenue is subject to fluctuation  moderate variations in the commencement  progress or completion of drug development trials may cause significant variations in quarterly results 
the following table presents unaudited quarterly operating results of covance for each of the eight most recent fiscal quarters during the period ended december  in the opinion of covance  the information in the table below has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results of operations for those periods

liquidity and capital resources covance has a centralized domestic cash management function whereby cash received from operations is generally swept daily to a centrally managed concentration account 
cash disbursements for operations are funded as needed from the concentration account 
from time to time excess cash balances are maintained at covance  generally for specific cash requirements 
covance s expected primary cash needs on both a short and long term basis are for capital expenditures  expansion of services  possible future acquisitions  geographic expansion  working capital and other general corporate purposes  including possible share repurchases 
covance believes cash from operations will provide sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future 
in addition  covance has access to additional cash through its million senior revolving credit facility the credit facility 
although the credit facility expires in june  covance is confident that should it decide to enter into a replacement credit facility  it will be able to do so on satisfactory terms 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings and million of outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility 
at december   covance has a remaining availability under the credit facility of million of which million remains available for letters of credit 
interest on all outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin 
costs associated with replacing the previous credit facility in june  consisting primarily of bank fees totaling million  are being amortized to interest expense over the three year facility term 
the credit facility contains various covenants  which among other things  restrict certain uses of cash such as certain restrictions on its ability to pay cash dividends on the covance common stock 
at december   covance was in compliance with the terms of its credit facility 
commitment fees for the year ended december  under the credit facility were percent of the undrawn balance of the credit facility and approximated million 
the credit facility is collateralized by guarantees of certain of covance s domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of percent of the capital stock of certain of covance s foreign subsidiaries 
as discussed in note to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  and as set forth in the table below  covance is obligated under non cancelable operating leases  primarily for its offices and laboratory facilities 
covance is also obligated under outsourcing agreements related to certain aspects of its information technology and human resources support functions  which is reflected as purchase obligations in the table below 
actual amounts paid under these outsourcing agreements could be higher or lower than the amounts shown below as a result of changes in volume and other variables 
in addition  early termination of these outsourcing agreements by covance could result in the payment of termination fees which are not reflected in the table below 
payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years years dollars in thousands operating leases purchase obligations total during the year ended december   covance s operations provided net cash of million  an increase of million from the corresponding period 
the change in net operating assets used million in cash during  primarily due to a decrease in accrued liabilities and unearned revenue  while this net change used million in cash during  primarily due to a decrease in unearned revenue 
covance s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  and at december  investing activities for the year ended december  used million compared to using million for the corresponding period 
capital spending for totaled million  and included the purchase of our previously leased geneva facility in september for million  expansion and enhancement of our harrogate  england facility  outfitting of new facilities  purchase of new equipment  upgrade of existing equipment and computer equipment and software for newly hired employees 
capital spending for the corresponding period totaled million  and was primarily for the expansion of covance s toxicology capacity  outfitting of new facilities  purchase of new equipment  upgrade of existing equipment and computer equipment and software for newly hired employees 
investing activities for also include the july acquisition of virtual central laboratory bv for a gross cash payment of million 
financing activities for the year ended december  provided million and consisted primarily of million received from stock option exercises and employee contributions to covance s noncompensatory employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by the purchase into treasury of  shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of million  primarily in connection with a million share buyback program authorized by covance s board of directors in february financing activities for the year ended december  used million for the purchase into treasury of  shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of million  primarily pursuant to a board of directors authorized  share buyback program  and repayments under the credit facility totaling million  offset by million received from stock option exercises and employee contributions to covance s noncompensatory employee stock purchase plan 
at december   covance s cash balances increased by million to million from million at december  inflation while most of covance s net revenues are earned under contracts  the long term contracts those in excess of one year generally include an inflation or cost of living adjustment for the portion of the services to be performed beyond one year from the contract date 
as a result  covance believes that the effects of inflation generally do not have a material effect on its operations or financial condition 
forward looking statements 
statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in certain other parts of this annual report on form k that look forward in time  are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include statements concerning plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events or performance  expectations  predictions  and assumptions and other statements which are other than statements of historical facts 
all such forward looking statements are based on the current expectations of management and are subject to  and are qualified by  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by those statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  competitive factors  outsourcing trends in the pharmaceutical industry  levels of industry research and development spending  the company s ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel  the fixed price nature of contracts or the loss of large contracts  risks associated with acquisitions and investments  the company s ability to increase profitability of its clinical development services and to increase order volume in central laboratory and commercialization services  and continued growth in demand for bioanalytical services and covance s ability to provide these services on a large scale basis  and other factors described in covance s filings with the securities and exchange commission  including  without limitation  this annual report on form k 
risk factors this section discusses various risk factors that are attendant with our business and the provision of our services 
if the events outlined below were to occur individually or in the aggregate  our business  results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical industry could decrease the need for the services we provide 
governmental agencies throughout the world  but particularly in the united states  strictly regulate the drug development process 
our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies navigate the regulatory drug approval process 
changes in regulation  such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying  could eliminate or substantially reduce the need for our services 
also  if government efforts to contain drug costs and pharmaceutical and biotechnology company profits from new drugs  our customers may spend less  or reduce their growth in spending on research and development 
if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products  our customers may spend less  or reduce their growth in spending on research and development 
failure to comply with existing regulations could result in a loss of revenue or earnings or in increased costs 
any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of on going research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities 
for example  if we were to fail to verify that patient participants were fully informed and have fully consented to a particular clinical trial  the data collected from that trial could be disqualified 
if this were to happen  we could be contractually required to repeat the trial at no further cost to our customer  but at substantial cost to us 
we may bear financial losses because most of our contracts are of a fixed price nature and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control 
many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or fee for service with a cap basis and they may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice 
cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons  including the failure of products to satisfy safety requirements  unexpected or undesired results of the products  insufficient patient enrollment  insufficient investigator recruitment  the client s decision to terminate the development of a product or to end a particular study  and our failure to perform properly our duties under the contract 
the loss  reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business  although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects  as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination 
some contracts also entitle us to a termination fee 
we may bear financial risk if we under price our contracts or overrun cost estimates 
since our contracts are often structured as fixed price or fee for service with a cap  we bear the financial risk if we initially under price our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates 
such under pricing or significant cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
we may not be able to successfully develop and market or acquire new services 
we may seek to develop and market new services that complement or expand our existing business or expand our service offerings through acquisition 
if we are unable to develop new services and or create demand for those newly developed services  or expand our service offerings through acquisition  our future business  results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows could be adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results may vary 
our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are influenced by factors over which we have little control such as exchange rate fluctuations  the commencement  completion or cancellation of large contracts  the progress of ongoing contracts  the timing of and charges associated with completed acquisitions or other events  and changes in the mix of our services 
we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results 
while fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively or positively affect the market price of our common stock  these fluctuations may not be related to our future overall operating performance 
we depend on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
our revenues depend greatly on the expenditures made by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in research and development 
accordingly  economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect our business 
if companies in these industries were to reduce the number of research and development projects they outsource  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
competitors in the contract research organization industry range from small  limited service providers to full service global contract research organizations 
our main competition consists of in house departments of pharmaceutical companies  full service contract research organizations  and universities and teaching hospitals  although to a lesser degree 
we compete on a variety of factors  including reputation for on time quality performance  expertise and experience in specific areas  scope of service offerings  strengths in various geographic markets  price  technological expertise and efficient drug development processes  ability to acquire  process  analyze and report data in an accurate manner  ability to manage large scale clinical trials both domestically and internationally  expertise and experience in health economics and outcomes services  and size 
for instance  our clinical development services have from time to time experienced periods of increased price competition which had a material adverse effect on covance s late stage development profitability and consolidated net revenues and net income 
covance took actions in to mitigate the effects of this price competition  however  if market conditions were to deteriorate  additional actions might be required in the future 
there is competition among the larger contract research organizations for both clients and potential acquisition candidates 
additionally  small  limited service entities considering entering the contract research organization industry will find few barriers to entry  thus further increasing possible competition 
these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our services and could adversely affect our financial results 
we may expand our business through acquisitions 
we review many acquisition candidates and  in addition to acquisitions which we have already made  we are continually evaluating new acquisition opportunities 
factors which may affect our ability to grow successfully through acquisitions include difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits  diversion of management s attention from current operations  the possibility that we may be adversely affected by risk factors facing the acquired companies  acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings  or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common stock to the shareholders of the acquired company  dilutive to the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders  potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller  risks of not being able to overcome differences in foreign business practices  language and other cultural barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies  and loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
we may be affected by potential health care reform 
in recent years the united states congress and state legislatures have considered various types of health care reform in order to control growing health care costs 
we are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future  if any 
similar reform movements have occurred in europe and asia 
implementation of health care reform legislation that contain costs could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs 
this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the united states and abroad 
in addition  new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability  increase our costs or limit our service offerings 
we rely on third parties for important services 
we depend on third parties to provide us with services critical to our business 
for instance  we have entered into an agreement with ibm to manage our information technology infrastructure including our computer and telephone network  e mail system  help desks  computer support and data centers worldwide 
the failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide the needed services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our revenues and earnings are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 
we derive a large portion of our net revenues from international operations 
for the fiscal year ended december   we derived approximately of our net revenues from outside the united states 
our financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  factors associated with international operations  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  could significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the loss of our key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of such personnel could adversely affect our business 
also  because of the nature of our business  our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain technologically qualified personnel 
there is substantial competition for qualified personnel  and an inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry 
contract research services create a risk of liability 
in contracting to work on drug development trials  we face a range of potential liabilities  for example errors or omissions that create harm during a trial to study volunteers or after a trial to consumers of the drug after regulatory approval of the drug  general risks associated with phase i facilities  including negative consequences from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of phase i medical care providers  errors or omissions from tests conducted for the agrochemical and food industries  risks that animals in our breeding facilities may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves and humans despite preventive measures contained in our company policies for the quarantine and handling of imported animals  and errors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial 
we also contract with physicians  also referred to as investigators  to conduct the clinical trials to test new drugs on human volunteers 
these tests can create a risk of liability for personal injury or death to volunteers  resulting from negative reactions to the drugs administered or from professional malpractice by third party investigators  particularly to volunteers with life threatening illnesses 
we believe that our risks in this area are generally reduced by the following contract provisions entitling us to be indemnified or entitling us to a limitation of liability  insurance maintained by our clients  investigators  and by us  and various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business 
contractual indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions  such as negligence or misconduct 
we could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim which is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify us does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or which is beyond the level of our insurance coverage 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us 
reliance on air transportation 
our central laboratories and  to a lesser extent  our other businesses  are heavily reliant on air travel for transport of clinical trial kits and other material and people  and a significant disruption to the air travel system could have a material adverse effect on our business 
actions of animal rights extremists may affect our business 
our early development services utilize animals predominantly rodents in preclinical testing of the safety and efficacy of drugs and also breed and sell animals for biomedical research 
such activities are required for the development of new medicines and medical devices under regulatory regimes in the united states  europe  japan and other countries 
acts of vandalism and other acts by animal rights extremists who object to the use of animals in drug development could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our animal populations may suffer diseases that can damage our inventory  harm our reputation and result in decreased sales of research products 
it is important that our research products be free of diseases  including infectious diseases 
the presence of diseases can distort or compromise the quality of research results  can cause loss of animals in our inventory or other losses 
such results could harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows
