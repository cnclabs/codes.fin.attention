overview incorporated in march  interwoven provides enterprise content management software and services that enable businesses to create  review  manage  distribute and archive critical business content  such as documents  spreadsheets  emails and presentations  as well as web images  graphics  content and applications code  across the enterprise and its value chain of customers  partners and suppliers 
our ecm platform consists of six integrated software product offerings  
table of contents delivering customers end to end content lifecycle management 
customers have deployed our products for enterprise initiatives such as brand management  enterprise portals  global web content management  content distribution  corporate governance  deal management and online self service 
to date  we have licensed our software products to more than  organizations worldwide 
we market and license our software products and services primarily through a direct sales force and augment our sales efforts through relationships with technology vendors  professional service firms  systems integrators and other strategic partners 
our revenues to date have been derived primarily from accounts in north america  however revenues from outside of north america accounted for of our total revenues in we had employees as of december  in june  we completed the acquisition of mediabin and  in november  we completed our merger with imanage 
the results of operations of mediabin and imanage have been included prospectively from the closing dates of these transactions through year end 
accordingly  our financial results in are not directly comparable to those in additionally  on november   we effected a one for four reverse stock split 
all share and per share information included in these consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split 
results of operations in and  our consolidated results of operations were adversely impacted by weak economic conditions domestically and internationally 
as a result of the economic slowdown  customer spending on information technology initiatives decreased sharply in and remained weak throughout most of our revenues were further impacted by a shift away from public facing web applications  such as our primary product  teamsite  to internal productivity enhancing applications 
as a result of these factors  our revenues declined from to and from to in response to declining revenues  we initiated a series of strategic actions designed to expand our product offerings and create a broader suite of ecm products 
during  we acquired mediabin and merged with imanage to extend our product offerings into digital asset management and collaborative document management  thereby creating product offerings that we believe address a greater market opportunity 
we further expect that these combinations will allow us to achieve greater economies of scale in our sales  marketing  development and administrative functions 
we also undertook a series of restructuring actions to align our cost structure with expected revenues 
these restructuring actions included staff reductions in all functional areas of our business  reduced marketing and promotional spending and the abandonment of certain facilities in excess of current and expected future needs 
revenues years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages license percentage of total revenues support and service percentage of total revenues total revenues decreased from million in to million in we believe the decrease in revenues from to is attributable to the continued worldwide economic slowdown that has resulted in a substantial reduction in overall spending on information technology initiatives  particularly web applications 
this decrease was partially offset by revenues from sales of worksite products after our merger with imanage and the revenues from sales of digital asset management products after our acquisition of mediabin 
total revenues decreased from million in to million in the decrease in total revenues from to is attributable to the worldwide economic slowdown  which resulted in fewer license transactions of our software products and a corresponding reduction in consulting services and training revenues 
our average selling prices were   and  in  and  respectively 
sales outside of north america represented  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
we expect the current economic slowdown to continue to adversely affect our business for the foreseeable future and  to the extent that an economic recovery is underway  such a recovery may not be sustained 
further  we believe that spending on software products such as ours may not begin to increase until after an economic recovery is underway 

table of contents license 
license revenues decreased from million in to million in we believe the decrease in license revenues from to was attributable to continued weak economic conditions domestically and internationally  resulting in reduced information technology spending  and a shift away from public facing web applications like our primary product  teamsite  to productivity enhancing software applications 
this decline was partially offset by license revenues from our digital asset management products acquired from mediabin in june of license revenues decreased from million in to million in the decrease in license revenues from to we believe was attributable to overall weakness in the global economy and reductions in expenditures on information technology 
license revenues represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in license revenues as a percentage of total revenues in each of the periods was due to a decline in license revenues and an increase in support revenues from our customer installed base 
support and service 
support and service revenues decreased from million in to million in the decrease in support and service revenues from to was the result of lower consulting services and training revenues  partially offset by higher support revenues due to our larger installed base of customers 
we believe the decrease in consulting services and training revenues from to was attributable to fewer customer engagements as a result of declining license transactions  as well as price competition from third party system integrators for consulting services and shorter implementations due to the improved design of our products 
customer support revenues increased slightly from to as a result of a larger installed base of customers purchasing support contracts 
support and service revenues decreased from million in to million in we believe the decrease in support and service revenues from to is attributable to fewer consulting services and training engagements  a decline in selling prices of our consulting services and  to a lesser extent  a shift by our customers to third party system integrators to perform customer implementations  which was partially offset by a slightly increase in customer support revenues 
support and services revenues accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
we believe the increase in support and services revenues as a percentage of total revenues was due to declining license revenues 
to the extent that our license revenues decline in the future  our support and services revenues may also decline 
specifically  a decline in license revenues may result in fewer consulting engagements 
additionally  since customer support contracts are generally sold with each license transaction  a decline in license revenues may also result in a decline in customer support revenues 
however  since customer support revenues are recognized over the duration of the support contract  the impact will lag a decline in license revenues 
cost of revenues years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages cost of license percentage of total revenues cost of support and service percentage of total revenues license 
cost of license includes expenses incurred to manufacture  package and distribute our software products and related documentation  as well as costs of licensing third party software embedded in or sold in conjunction with our software products 
cost of license represented  and of total license revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of license in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues from to and from to were attributable to an increase in royalties to third parties for software embedded in our software applications and software bundled with our products  including royalties paid to imanage of million in prior to the merger 
in addition  in  cost of license revenues included amortization of purchased technology associated with the business combinations with imanage and mediabin of million 

table of contents based only on acquisitions completed through the year end  we expect the amortization of purchased technology classified as a cost of license revenues to be million in  million in  million in and  in we expect cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues to vary from period to period depending on the mix of the products sold  the extent to which third party software products are bundled with our products and the amount of overall license revenues  as many of the third party software products embedded with our software are under fixed fee arrangements 
support and service 
cost of support and service consists of salary and personnel related expenses for our consulting services  training and support personnel  costs associated with product updates to customers under active support contracts  subcontractor expenses and depreciation of equipment used in our services and customer support operation 
cost of support and service decreased to million in from million in and decreased from million in to the decrease in cost of support and services from to was due primarily to lower personnel costs of million and lower travel costs of million as a result of lower headcount 
the decrease in cost of support and services from to was due to lower personnel costs of million  lower travel costs of million and lower subcontractor expense of million as a result of reduced consulting services engagements and efforts to increase utilization of our in house consulting staff 
cost of support and service represented  and of support and service revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of support and service as a percentage of related revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in support revenues as a percentage of total support and service revenues  as support revenues generally have greater gross margins than consulting services and training 
support and service headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in headcount from to was due to the imanage merger that closed in november  which results in higher head count at year end while the decrease in headcount from to was due to restructuring actions 
since our support and service revenues have lower gross margins than our license revenues  our overall gross margins will typically decline if our support and service revenues increase as a percent of total revenues 
we expect cost of support and service revenues as a percentage of support and service revenues to vary from period to period  depending in part on whether the services are performed by our in house staff  subcontractors or third party system integrators 
as our customers become more capable of performing services activities in house or increase the use of third party systems integrators and as our software products become easier to implement  we expect our support and service revenues and cost of support and service revenues realized on a per customer basis to decline 
operating expenses sales and marketing years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing percentage of total revenues sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions  benefits and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  travel and marketing programs  including customer conferences  promotional materials  trade shows and advertising 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in the decrease in sales and marketing expense from to was due primarily to a million reduction in personnel costs as a result of lower average headcount in the period  million in lower commissions as a result of lower revenues and a million reduction in promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease related to a million reduction in personnel costs  a million reduction in commissions expense and a million reduction in marketing programs 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses represented  and in  and  respectively 
sales and marketing headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in headcount from to was due to the imanage merger that closed in november  which results in higher head count at year end while the decrease in headcount from to was due to restructuring actions 

table of contents we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  will decrease in from levels posted in due  in large part  to expected economies of scale associated with the imanage merger 
we also anticipate that the percentage of total revenues represented by sales and marketing expenses will fluctuate from period to period due to the timing of hiring of new sales and marketing personnel  our spending on marketing programs to increase the demand for our products and the level of revenues  in particular license revenues  in each period 
research and development years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages research and development percentage of total revenues research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits  third party contractors  facilities and related overhead costs associated with our product development and quality assurance activities 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in the decrease from to was primarily due to a million decline in personnel costs associated with headcount reductions 
research and development expenses decreased  or million from to the decrease from to was due primarily to a million decline in personnel costs as well as lower subcontractor expense of million 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
research and development headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in headcount in over was due to the imanage merger in november  which results in higher head count at year end while the decrease from to was due to workforce reductions 
we expect that research and development expense in will decline slightly as a percentage of total revenues when compared to as we continue to manage our expenses and realize greater cost efficiencies associated with the imanage merger 
general and administrative years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages general and administrative percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  human resources  legal and information technology  as well as insurance  professional fees  facilities costs and provisions for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in the decrease from to was primarily due to a million decline in personnel costs and a  reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or million  from to the decrease in general and administrative expenses from to includes million in lower personnel costs and a million reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses was  and in  and  respectively 
general and administrative headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in headcount from to was due to the imanage merger that closed in november  which results in higher head count at year end while the decrease in headcount from to was due to restructuring actions to reduce overhead costs 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decline slightly as a percentage of total revenues in when compared to due to continued cost control efforts and economies of scale associated with the imanage merger 

table of contents amortization of stock based compensation years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages amortization of stock based compensation percentage of total revenues we recorded deferred stock based compensation in connection with stock options granted prior to our initial public offering and in connection with stock options granted and assumed during our business combinations 
amortization of stock based compensation was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decreases in amortization of stock based compensation in from and in from were primarily attributable to the use of the accelerated method of amortizing deferred compensation expense  as prescribed by financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and  which has resulted in greater recognition of amortization expense in the beginning of the vesting period for such options 
amortization of stock based compensation related to the following expense categories in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for  and  respectively in thousands years ended december  cost of support and service sales and marketing research and development general and administrative during  we recognized restructuring costs of million associated with accelerated vesting of stock awards of terminated employees 
this amount was included as a component of restructuring and excess facilities charges in our consolidated statements of operations 
in december we issued options to purchase  shares of our common stock to our chief executive officer  with an exercise price of per share  which was below the fair value of our common stock of at the date of grant 
in accordance with the requirements of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  we have recorded deferred stock based compensation for the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of our stock on the date of grant 
this deferred stock based compensation will be amortized to expense over a four year term  using an accelerated approach 
this accelerated approach is consistent with the method described in fin no 
at december   we have recorded deferred stock based compensation related to these options in an amount of million 
we expect amortization of stock based compensation to be million in  million in   in and  in the expected increase in amortization of stock based compensation from to is due to stock options assumed in the mediabin and imanage business combinations as well as the stock option grant to our chief executive officer in december amortization of stock based compensation will be reduced in future periods to the extent options are cancelled prior to vesting 
amortization of intangible assets years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages amortization of intangible assets percentage of total revenues 
table of contents amortization of intangible assets was million  million and million in  and  respectively  and consists of amortization expense related to customer lists  assembled workforce and  in  goodwill associated with our business combinations 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january   and  as a result  we ceased amortizing the remaining unamortized balance of goodwill of million 
we expect amortization of intangible assets to be million in  million in  million in and million in the expected increase in amortization of intangible assets from to is due to the merger with imanage 
in process research and development years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages in process research and development percentage of total revenues percentage is not meaningful in  in conjunction with our acquisition of mediabin and the merger with imanage  we recorded in process research and development charges of  and million  respectively 
these in process research and development charges were associated with software development efforts in process at the time of the business combinations that had not yet achieved technological feasibility and no future alternative uses had been identified 
the purchase price allocated to in process research and development was determined  in part  by a third party appraiser through established valuation techniques 
we may incur in process research and development expense to the extent we make additional acquisitions in the future 
restructuring and excess facilities charges years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages restructuring and excess facilities charges percentage of total revenues in  we implemented a restructuring plan to improve our operating performance in light of a global economic slowdown and reduction in information technology spending 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we abandoned certain facilities in the san francisco bay area and austin  texas  in an effort to consolidate our existing facilities 
as a result of this plan  we recorded a charge of million associated with the abandonment of leased facilities which included our remaining lease commitments  less estimated sublease income  and the impairment of certain operating equipment and leasehold improvements associated with these abandoned facilities 
we also recorded a  charge associated with workforce reductions  which consisted principally of severance benefits 
in  we implemented several restructuring plans in an effort to better align our expenses with our revenues 
we recorded charges of million associated with workforce reductions and a charge of million associated with the abandonment of excess facilities and the impairment of certain operating equipment and leasehold improvements at these facilities 
additionally  due to the continued deterioration of the commercial real estate market  we revised our assumptions of future sublease income for certain facilities previously abandoned in and recorded an additional million in charges to reflect this change in estimate 
during  we implemented additional restructuring plans and performed an evaluation of our facilities requirements and our previously recorded excess facilities accrual 
as a result of these additional restructuring activities  we recorded charges of million associated with workforce reductions  million associated with the abandonment of facilities and  of integration costs associated with the imanage merger 
in addition  we revised our estimates regarding future sublease income for certain facilities previously abandoned and recorded an additional million in charges to reflect these changes in estimates 

table of contents the charges recorded for excess facilities are based on the payments due over the remainder of the lease term and estimated operating costs offset by our estimate of future sublease income 
our excess facilities are being marketed for sublease and most are currently unoccupied 
accordingly  our estimate of excess facilities costs could differ from actual results and such differences could result in additional charges that could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
impairment of goodwill years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages impairment of goodwill percentage of total revenues percentage is not meaningful in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed an annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill and other identified intangible assets during the third quarter of upon the completion of this analysis  it was determined that an impairment of goodwill had occurred as a result of a decrease in our market capitalization and due to a decline in our business performance 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in  reflecting the write down of the carrying value of goodwill to its estimated fair value 
we performed similar impairment tests during the third quarter of and determined that the carrying value of our goodwill and other identified intangible assets had not been further impaired 
interest income and other  net years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages interest income and other  net percentage of total revenues interest income and other was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest income and other decreased million  or  in from and million  or  in from the decreases were due to lower interest rates on our cash and investments and a lower average balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments during each successive period 
provision for income taxes years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes percentage of total revenues the provision for income taxes recorded in  and related to state and international taxes 
as of december   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income 
the federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards are available to reduce future taxable income and will expire in through and through  respectively 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and recognizes the tax benefit only as reassessment demonstrates that these assets are realizable 
at such time  it is determined that it is not likely that the assets will be realized 
therefore  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred income tax assets 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million  or  to million as of december  from million at december  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million  or from to cash provided used in  and was as follows in thousands years ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities

after excluding the effects of non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization of million  amortization of stock based compensation of million  amortization of intangible assets of million and in process research and development of million  the adjusted cash usage before the effect of changes in working capital components was million 
additional cash usage was the result of an increase of million in accounts receivable and a decrease of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by an increase of million in deferred revenues  an increase of million in restructuring and excess facilities charges and a decrease of  in prepaid expenses and other assets

after excluding the effects of non cash items including depreciation and amortization of million  amortization of stock based compensation of million and amortization of intangible assets of million  the adjusted cash usage before the effect of changes in working capital components was million 
additional cash was generated from an increase of million in restructuring and excess facilities charges  an increase of million in deferred revenues  a decrease of million in prepaid expenses and other assets  an increase of  in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease of  in accounts receivable 
a number of non cash items were charged to expense and increased our net loss in  and  respectively 
these items include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets  impairment of goodwill  in process research and development and amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
the extent to which these non cash items increase or decrease in amount and increase or decrease our future operating results will have no corresponding impact on our operating cash flows 
our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers offset by payments to our employees  vendors and service providers 
we measure the effectiveness of our collection efforts by an analysis of average accounts receivable days outstanding days outstanding 
days outstanding were days  days and days on december   and  respectively 
our days outstanding increased in from due to an increase in customer support contract billings in the fourth quarter of  which added to our outstanding accounts receivable and deferred revenues 
the increase in support contract billings resulted from the merger with imanage 
table of contents and seasonally higher fourth quarter support contract renewals 
collections of accounts receivable and related days outstanding will fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and amount of our future revenues  payment terms on customer contracts and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
our operating cash flows will also be impacted in the future based on the timing of payments to our vendors 
we endeavor to pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with invoice terms and conditions 
the timing of cash payments in future periods will be impacted by the nature of vendor arrangements and management s assessment of our cash inflows 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in this primarily resulted from net proceeds from investment activity of million  comprised of million of proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments partially offset by million to purchase investment securities   to purchase property and equipment and million used to acquire imanage and mediabin  net of cash acquired 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in this primarily resulted from net proceeds from investment activity of million  comprised of million of proceeds from the maturity and sale of our investments partially offset by million to purchase investment securities  million to purchase property and equipment and  to purchase technology 
net cash used in investing activities was million in this primarily resulted from net cash used in investment activity of million  comprised of million of cash used in purchases of investment securities partially offset by million of proceeds received from the maturity and sale of investments  million of purchases property and equipment  million of acquisition of business net of cash acquired and million to purchase technology 
we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investments objectives are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we generally hold investments in commercial paper  corporate bonds and united states government agency securities to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including the hiring of employees  the rate of change of computer hardware and software used in our business and our business outlook 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in included million from the net proceeds from issuance of common stock  partially offset by repayments of bank borrowings of  net cash used in financing activities of million in included million of repurchase of common stock and treasury stock  partially offset by million of net proceeds from issuance of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in included million of net proceeds from issuance of common stock  partially offset by million of repurchase of common stock and treasury stock 
our cash flows from financing activities are primarily the result of cash receipts from the issuance of common stock  our repurchases of common stock and treasury stock  and borrowings and payments under our lines of credit 
we have used our lines of credit primarily to finance purchases of property and equipment 
we receive cash from the exercise of common stock options and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
while we expect to continue to receive these proceeds in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds is difficult to predict and is contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan and general market conditions 
we may continue to use lines of credit to finance our equipment purchases to the extent that such financing is available to us on acceptable terms 
from time to time  our board of directors has approved common stock repurchase programs allowing management to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market 

table of contents bank borrowings 
we had available two lines of credit and a term loan at december  we have a million line of credit with a financial institution  which bears interest at the bank s prime rate  which was at december  and is secured by cash 
there were no outstanding borrowings at december  under this line of credit  which expires in july we have a million line of credit with another financial institution  which is secured by cash and bears interest at our option of either a variable rate of below the bank s prime rate adjusted from time to time or a fixed rate of above the libor in effect on the first day of the term 
this line of credit agreement expires in december there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit as of december  in connection with the imanage merger  we assumed a term loan with a bank secured by certain of our property and equipment 
the loan bears interest at the greater of prime plus or 
principal payments are due quarterly and will continue until november when the remaining outstanding balance is due in full 
at december   we had million outstanding under the term loan 
there are no covenant requirements on any of our lines of credit and the term loan 
facilities 
we lease our facilities under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through as of december   minimum cash payment due under our operating lease obligations total million 
the following presents our prospective future lease payments under these agreements as of december  excluding our estimate of potential sublease income in thousands years ending december  occupied facilities excess facilities future lease payments thereafter of these future minimum lease payments  we have accrued million in the restructuring and excess facilities accrual at december  this accrual includes million of estimated operating expenses associated with excess facilities and sublease commencement costs and is net of our estimate of sublease income of million 
we have entered into various standby letter of credit agreements associated with our facilities leases  which serve as required security deposits for such facilities 
these letters of credit expire at various times through at december   we had million outstanding under standby letters of credit  which are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the following presents the outstanding commitments under these agreements at each respective balance sheet date for the next five years in thousands years ending december  standby letters of credit through thereafter we currently anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with our existing lines of credit  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding at any time 
we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 

table of contents financial risk management as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
our primary exposures relate to non united states dollar denominated revenues and operating expenses in europe  asia pacific  australia and canada 
at the present time  the exposure is not significant  however  we engaged in limited and immaterial amount of foreign currency forward contract activities in we do not anticipate significant currency gains or losses in the near term 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenues  loss from operations and net loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to an understanding of our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses and significant estimates and judgments applied by management 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  estimating the accrual for restructuring and excess facilities costs  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from the license of our software products and from support  consulting and training services that we provide to our customers 
we recognize revenue using the residual method in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  for agreements that have multiple deliverables or multiple element arrangements eg  software products  services  support  etc  revenue is recognized based on company specific objective evidence of fair value for all of the delivered elements 
our specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price of the element when sold separately 
once we have established the fair value of each of the undelivered elements  the dollar value of the arrangement is allocated to the undelivered elements first and the residual of that amount is then allocated to the delivered elements 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements eg  support  consulting and training and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in the arrangement ie  software product when the basic criteria in sop have been met 
if such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
under sop  revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
at the outset of our customer arrangements  if we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable 
table of contents based on the payment terms associated with each transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due beyond our normal payments terms  which generally does not exceed days from the invoice date  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we do not offer product return rights to resellers or end users 
we determine collectibility on a case by case basis  following analysis of the general payment history within the geographic sales region and a customer s years of operation  payment history and credit profile 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our review process  we recognize revenue as payments are received 
support and service revenues consist of professional services and support fees 
professional services consist of software installation and integration  training and business process consulting 
professional services are predominantly billed on a time and materials basis and we recognize revenues as the services are performed 
support contracts are typically priced as a percentage of the product license fee and have a one year term  renewable annually 
services provided to customers under support contracts include technical product support and unspecified product upgrades 
deferred revenues from advanced payments for support contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  which is typically one year 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we make estimates as to the overall collectibility of accounts receivable and provide an allowance for amounts deemed to be uncollectible 
management specifically analyzes its accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts balance  which related to specific accounts where we believe collection is not probable and to a lesser extent our historical experience applied to accounts receivable not specifically reserved  was million and million  respectively 
these amounts represent and of total accounts receivable at december  and allowance for sales returns 
from time to time  a customer may return to us some or all of the software purchased 
while our software and reseller agreements generally do not provide for a specific right of return  we may accept product returns in certain circumstances 
to date  sales returns have been infrequent and not significant in relation to our total revenues 
we make an estimate of our expected returns and provide an allowance for sales returns in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
in determining the amount of the allowance required  management specifically analyzes its revenue transactions  customer software installation patterns  historical return pattern  current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
at december  and  our allowance for sales returns was  and  respectively 
restructuring and excess facilities accrual 
due to the continued economic slowdown and associated reduction in information technology spending  we implemented a series of restructuring and facility consolidation plans to improve our operating performance 
restructuring and facilities consolidation costs consist of expenses associated with workforce reductions  consolidation of excess facilities and the impairment of leasehold improvements and other equipment associated with abandoned facilities 
workforce reductions in connection with our restructuring plans  we accrue for severance payments and other related termination benefits provided to employees in connection with involuntary staff reductions 
we accrue for these benefits in the period when benefits are communicated to the terminated employees 
typically  terminated employees are not required to provide continued service to receive termination benefits 
if continued service is required  then the severance liability is accrued over the required service period 
in general  we use a formula based on a combination of the number of years of service and the employee s position within the company to calculate the termination benefits to be provided to affected employees 
at december   million was accrued for future severance and termination benefits payments 

table of contents excess facilities in connection with our restructuring and facility consolidation plans  we perform evaluations of our then current facilities requirements and identify facilities that are in excess of our current and estimated future needs 
when a facility is identified as excess and we have ceased use of the facility  we accrue the fair value of the lease obligations 
in determining fair value  we consider expected sublease income over the remainder of the lease term and related exit costs if any 
to determine the estimated sublease income  we receive appraisals from real estate brokers to aid in our estimate 
in addition  during our evaluation of our facilities requirements  we also identify operating equipment and leasehold improvements that may have suffered a reduction in their economic useful lives 
most of our excess facilities are being marketed for sublease and are currently unoccupied 
accordingly  our estimate of excess facilities could differ from actual results and such differences could result in additional charges that could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
at december   we had million accrued for excess facilities  which is payable through this accrual is net of estimated future sublease income of million 
we reassess our excess facilities liability each period based on current real estate market conditions 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenues  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not or unknown  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  consisting principally of certain net operating losses carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant 
we are required to perform an impairment review of goodwill on at least an annual basis 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we move on to step if the unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit 
we performed our annual impairment test in the third quarter of  we determined that goodwill had been impaired as of the valuation date 
accordingly  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million during the three months ended september  in performing our testing  we were required to make estimates regarding future operating trends and other variables used in the analysis 
actual future results could differ from the estimates used in the analysis 
we performed and completed our required annual impairment testing in the third quarter of upon completing our review  we determined that the carrying value of our recorded goodwill had not been impaired 
accordingly  no impairment charge was recorded as a result of our tests under sfas no 
we expect to perform our annual impairment test in the third quarter of 
table of contents we are also required to assess goodwill for impairment on an interim basis when indicators exist that goodwill may be impaired based on the factors mentioned above 
for example  if our market capitalization declines below our net book value or we suffer a sustained decline in our stock price  we will assess whether our goodwill has been impaired 
a significant impairment could result in additional charges and have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and operating results 
we account for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets utilizing sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of an asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we do not believe there were any circumstances which indicated that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the following table reflects the expected future amortization impact of intangible assets in thousands years ending december  amortization of intangible assets amortization of purchased technology the amortization expense related to the intangible assets may be accelerated in the future if we reduce the estimated useful life of the intangible assets  for example if expected cash flows to be generated by these assets decline 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of sfas no 
on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
in particular  sfas clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative 
it also clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after september  and did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how a company classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify certain financial instruments as a liability or as an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  fasb issued fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee 
it also requires additional disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued 
the accounting requirements for the initial recognition of guarantees are applicable on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for all guarantees outstanding  regardless of when they were issued or modified  during the first quarter of the adoption of fin no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the agreements that we have determined are within the scope of fin no 

table of contents we enter into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to these agreements  we indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party generally  our business partners  subsidiaries and or customers  in connection with any united states patent or any copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our products or services 
the term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
we have not incurred significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is not significant 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  we warrant that our software products will perform in all material respects in accordance with our standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the licensed products to the customer 
additionally  we warrant that our support and professional services will be performed consistent with generally accepted industry standards 
if necessary  we would provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history 
we have not incurred significant expense under our product or services warranties 
we may  at our discretion and in the ordinary course of business  subcontract the performance of any of our services 
accordingly  we enter into standard indemnification agreements with our customers  whereby customers are indemnified for other acts  such as personal property damage  of our subcontractors 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
however  we have general and umbrella insurance policies that enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid 
we have not incurred significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
in january  fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin no 
addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
in december  the fasb issued a revised interpretation no 
fin no 
r  which expands the criteria for consideration in determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated 
public companies must apply fin no 
r to entities considered to be special purpose entities no later than the end of the first reporting period that ended after december   and no later then the first reporting period that ends after march  for all other entities 
at this time  we do not have any interests in variable interest entities and do not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
factors that may impact our business the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
these risks include those that we consider to be significant to your decision whether to invest in our common stock at this time 
there may be risks that you  in particular  view differently than we do  and there are other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know of or that we currently deem immaterial  but that may  in fact  harm our business in the future 
if any of these events occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment 
you should consider carefully the following factors  in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  in evaluating interwoven and our business 
we have incurred losses throughout our operating history and may not be able to achieve consistent profitability 
we have incurred operating losses on a quarterly and annual basis throughout our history 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we must increase our license and support and service revenues to achieve profitable operations and positive cash flow 
if our revenues do not grow  we will not become profitable 
in fact  our revenues may decline from earlier periods resulting in greater operating losses and significant negative cash flows 

table of contents many factors can cause our revenues to fluctuate on a quarterly basis and if we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors or market analysts  our stock price may decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect unpredictable fluctuations in the future 
the main factors impacting these fluctuations are likely to be the discretionary nature of our customers purchases and their budget cycles  the number of new information technology initiatives launched by our customers  the size and complexity of our license transactions  potential delays in recognizing revenue from license transactions  timing of new product releases  changes in competitors product offerings  sales force capacity and the influence of resellers and systems integrator partners  and seasonal variations in our operating results 
if our results of operations do not meet our public forecasts or the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
although we expect that the recently completed merger with imanage will result in benefits to us  we may not realize those benefits because of integration and other challenges 
if we fail to successfully integrate the operations of interwoven and imanage  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the merger  including anticipated cost savings and revenue synergies  which could seriously harm our future operating results 
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend in part on our ability to execute on our post merger strategy in an efficient and timely manner 
our post merger strategy includes but is not limited to combining the operations of interwoven and imanage  integrating and managing our technologies  retaining  motivating and assimilating the key managerial  sales and technical personnel  retaining existing customers of interwoven and imanage and attracting new customers  retaining existing and attracting new strategic partners and resellers  and creating and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures  policies and information 
we have not previously faced an integration challenge as substantial as the one presented by the recent merger with imanage  which could make it more difficult to implement the post merger strategies or realize the benefits of the merger 
the risks related to the execution of our post merger strategies include the disruption of our on going business and distraction of our management  the difficulties inherent in combining product offerings  coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively communicate our capabilities  the inability to integrate financial and business systems to conduct the on going business of the merged company  the need to demonstrate to customers that the merger will not result in adverse changes in our financial viability  our customer support and service standards and our investment in and commitment to products and vertical markets  and the impairment of relationships with employees  suppliers and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel 
to the extent we are unable to successfully realize the anticipated benefits of the merger  our consolidated financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 

table of contents customer uncertainties related to the recently completed merger with imanage could harm our businesses and results of operations 
since the merger with imanage  we have been communicating our future plans to our customers 
despite these efforts  there may be customer uncertainty  causing our customers to delay or defer purchasing decisions or elect to switch to other suppliers 
in particular  prospective customers could be reluctant to purchase our products due to uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings and our willingness to support existing products 
prospective and current customers may worry about how integration of the two companies technologies may affect current and future products 
to the extent that the recently completed merger creates customer uncertainty  our consolidated results of operations would be seriously harmed 
further  we may have to make additional customer assurances and assume additional obligations to address our customers uncertainty about the direction of our products and related support offerings 
accordingly  our operating results could be substantially below expectations of market analysts  potentially decreasing our stock price 
support and service revenues have represented a larger percentage of our total revenues in and our support and service revenues are vulnerable to reduced demand and increased competition 
our support and service revenues represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
support and services revenues depend  in part  on our ability to license software products to new and existing customers that generate follow on consulting  training and support revenues 
demand for these services is also impacted by competition from independent service providers and systems integrators with knowledge of our software products 
the economic slowdown over the past three years and the corresponding reduction in information technology spending has increased competition for service engagements and has resulted in an overall decrease in average billing rates for our consultants  and price pressure on our software support products 
if we are unable to successfully manage our support and service revenues in light of current economic conditions impacting our business  our support and service revenues may continue to decline and may have a material and adverse affect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues are derived from a small number of software products and vertical markets 
in  we derived approximately of our total revenues from licensing interwoven teamsite content server and related products and services 
we expect that our teamsite product will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods 
any decline in the demand for our teamsite product will have a material and adverse affect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we also derive a significant portion of our revenues from a few vertical markets 
in particular  our worksite product is primarily sold to legal and professional service firms 
in order for us to sustain and grow our business  we must continue to successfully sell our software products and services into this vertical market 
failure to successfully sell to law firms and professional service firms will have a significant and adverse affect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
in general  we believe that our customers in these markets are affected by the same conditions that affect our customers in other markets 
further  the future success of our collaborative content management software applications depends on our ability to sell software licenses and services to large multi national corporations in financial services  manufacturing and governments 
to sell to these organizations  we must devote time and resources to hire and train sales employees to work in industries other than legal and professional service firms 
even if we are successful in hiring and training sales teams  customers in other industries may not perceive the value in or require our collaborative content management software applications 
declining economic conditions and significant world events have harmed and could continue to negatively impact our revenues and results of operations 
our revenue growth and profitability depend on the overall demand for our enterprise content management software platforms and applications 
prolonged economic weakness in the united states and declining economic conditions worldwide have resulted in and may continue to result in lower sales volume  longer sales cycles  lower average selling prices and deferred or cancelled orders 
to the extent that the economy does not recover or continues to decline  we believe demand for our products and services  and therefore our future revenues  will be further impacted 
in addition  many of our customers have also been adversely impacted by the economic slowdown and  as a result  we may find that collecting on accounts receivable may take longer than we expect or that some accounts receivable will become uncollectible 

table of contents our consolidated financial results could also be significantly impacted by geopolitical concerns and world events 
specifically  our revenues for the third quarter of were negatively impacted by delays in customer orders and longer sales cycles resulting from the september th terrorist attacks 
we also experienced delays in customer orders in the first quarter of as a result of concerns over the war in iraq 
our revenues and financial results could be negatively impacted to the extent geopolitical concerns continue and similar events occur or are anticipated to occur 
our products have a long and unpredictable sales cycle  which makes it difficult to forecast our future results and may cause our operating results to vary from period to period 
the period between initial contact with a prospective customer and the licensing of our software applications varies and can range from three to more than twelve months 
additionally  our sales cycle is long and involves complexity as customers consider a number of factors before committing to purchase our application suite 
factors considered by customers when evaluating our application suite include product benefits  cost and time of implementation  return on investment  ability to operate with existing and future computer systems and the ability to accommodate increased transaction volume and product reliability 
customer evaluation  purchasing and budgeting processes vary significantly from company to company 
as a result  we spend significant time and resources informing prospective customers about our software products  which may not result in a completed transaction and may negatively impact our operating margins 
even if our software products have been chosen by the customer  completion of the sales transaction is subject to a number of factors  which makes our quarterly revenues difficult to forecast 
these factors include but are not limited to licensing of our software products is often an enterprise wide decision by our customers that involves many factors 
accordingly  our ability to license our product may be impacted by changes in the strategic importance of content management projects to our customers  budgetary constraints or changes in customer personnel 
a customer s internal approval and expenditure authorization process can be difficult and time consuming 
delays in approvals  even after selection of a vendor  could impact the timing and amount of revenues recognized in a quarterly period 
changes in our sales incentive plans may have an unpredictable impact on our sales cycle and contracting activities 
the number  timing and significance of enhancements to our software products and the introduction of new software by our competitors and us may affect customer purchasing decisions 
in and  our sales cycles continued to lengthen due to increased organizational review by sales prospects  regardless of transaction size 
a continued lengthening in sales cycles and our inability to predict these trends could result in lower than expected future revenue  which would have a material impact on our consolidated operating results and  correspondingly  our stock price 
because about two thirds of our revenues are influenced by referrals from strategic partners and sold through resellers  our future success depends in part on those partners  but their interests differ from ours 
our direct sales force depends on strategic partnerships  marketing alliances and resellers to obtain customer leads  referrals and distribution 
approximately two thirds of our revenues are influenced by our strategic partners and resellers 
if we are unable to maintain our existing strategic relationships or fail to enter into additional strategic relationships  our ability to increase our sales and reduce expenses will be harmed  and we could also lose anticipated customer introductions and co marketing benefits 
our success depends in part on the success of our strategic partners and their ability and willingness to market our products and services successfully 
we also rely on our strategic partnerships to aid in the development of our products 
losing the support of these third parties may limit our ability to penetrate our existing and potential markets 
these third parties are under no obligation to recommend or support our software products and could recommend or give higher priority to the products and services of other companies or to their own products 
our inability to gain the support of resellers  consulting and systems integrator firms or a shift by these companies toward favoring competing products could negatively affect our software license and support and service revenues 
some systems integrators also engage in joint marketing and sales efforts with us 
if our relationship with these systems integrators fails  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing of our software products 
in many cases  these parties have extensive relationships with our existing and potential customers and influence 
table of contents the decisions of these customers 
a number of our competitors have longer and more established relationships with these systems integrators than we do and  as a result  these systems integrators may be more likely to recommend competitors products and services 
we may also be unable to grow our revenues if we do not successfully obtain leads and referrals from our customers 
if we are unable to maintain these existing customer relationships or fail to establish additional relationships  we will be required to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing of our products 
as a result  we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to provide us with introductions  referrals and leads 
our current customer relationships do not afford us any exclusive marketing and distribution rights 
in addition  our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time  pursue relationships with our competitors or develop or acquire products that compete with our products 
even if our customers act as references and provide us with leads and introductions  we may not penetrate additional markets or grow our revenues 
we also rely on our strategic partnerships to aid in the development of our products 
should our strategic partners not regard us as significant to their own businesses  they could reduce their commitment to us or terminate their relationship with us  pursue competing relationships or attempt to develop or acquire products or services that compete with our products and services 
the timing of large customer orders may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results from period to period 
from time to time  we receive large customer orders that have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue 
because it is difficult for us to accurately predict the timing of such large customer orders  our consolidated financial results are likely to vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 
additionally  the loss or delay of an anticipated large order in a given quarterly period could result in a shortfall of revenues from levels anticipated by us and our stockholders 
any shortfall in revenues from levels anticipated by our shareholders and securities analysts will have a material and adverse impact on the trading price of our stock 
contractual issues may arise during the negotiation process that may delay the anticipated closure of license transactions and our ability to recognize revenue as anticipated 
because our solution is mission critical to many of our customers  the process of contractual negotiation may be protracted 
the additional time needed to negotiate mutually acceptable terms that culminate in an agreement to license our products could extend the sales cycle 
several factors may also require us to defer recognition of license revenue for a significant period of time after entering into a license agreement  including instances in which we are required to deliver either unspecified additional products or specified product upgrades for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
while we have a standard software license agreement that provides for revenue recognition provided that delivery has taken place  collectibility from the customer is reasonably assured and assuming no significant future obligations or customer acceptance rights exist  customer negotiations and revisions to these terms could impact our ability to recognize revenue at the time of delivery 
in addition  slowdowns or variances from internal expectations in our quarterly license contracting activities may impact our service offerings and may result in lower revenues from our customer training  consulting services and customer support organizations 
our ability to maintain or increase support and service revenues is highly dependent on our ability to increase the number of license agreements we enter into with customers 
if the emerging market for enterprise content management software does not develop as quickly as we expect  our business will suffer 
the market for our enterprise content management software is rapidly evolving 
we cannot be certain that a viable market for our products will emerge or be sustainable 
if the enterprise content management software market fails to develop  or develops more slowly than expected  demand for our products will be less than anticipated and our business and operating results would be seriously harmed 

table of contents furthermore  to be successful in this emerging market  we must be able to differentiate our business from our competitors through our product and service offerings and brand name recognition 
we may not be successful in differentiating our business or achieving widespread market acceptance of our products and services 
in addition  enterprises that have already invested substantial resources in other methods of managing their content and collaborative process may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that may replace  limit or compete with their existing systems 
competition from providers of software enabling content and collaboration management among businesses is increasing  which could cause us to reduce our prices and result in reduced gross margins or loss of market share 
the enterprise content management market is new  highly fragmented  rapidly changing and increasingly competitive 
we expect competition to continue to intensify  which could result in price reductions for our products  reduced gross margins  increased sales cycles and loss of market share  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our current competitors include companies addressing segments of our market including emc corporation  filenet corporation  hummingbird ltd  microsoft corporation  open text corporation  stellent  inc and vignette corporation  intranet and groupware companies such as ibm  microsoft corporation  and novell  inc  and in house development efforts by our customers and partners 
we also face potential competition from our strategic partners  such as bea systems  inc and oracle corporation  or from other companies that may in the future decide to compete in our market 
some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
many of these companies can also take advantage of extensive customer bases and adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
potential competitors may bundle their products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
for example  microsoft sells a content management product and might choose to bundle it with other products in ways that would harm our competitive position 
barriers from entering the content management software market are relatively low 
competitive pressures may also increase with the consolidation of competitors within our market and partners in our distribution channel  such as the acquisition of documentum  inc by emc corporation  presence online pty ltd 
by ibm  kramer lee associates by hummingbird ltd 
and tower technology pty ltd 
and epicentric  inc by vignette corporation 
in recent quarters  some of our competitors have drastically reduced their price proposals in an effort to strengthen their bids and expand their customer bases 
such tactics  even if unsuccessful  could delay decisions by some customers that would otherwise purchase our software products and may reduce the ultimate selling price of our software and services 
our revenues from international operations are a significant part of our overall operating results 
we may not successfully develop these international markets  which could harm our business 
we have established offices in various international locations in europe and asia pacific and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from these international locations 
for the years ended december   and  revenues from these international operations constituted approximately  and of our total revenues  respectively 
we anticipate devoting significant resources and management attention to international opportunities  which subjects us to a number of risks including changes in multiple tax and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  the expense of foreign operations and compliance with applicable laws  political and economic instability  the expense of localizing products for sale in various international markets  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  longer sales cycles and collection periods or seasonal reductions in business activity  and 
table of contents economic downturns in international markets 
any of these risks could reduce revenues from international locations  or increase our cost of doing business outside of the united states 
fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency  particularly in the euro and british pound and the various local currencies of australia  asia and europe  may harm our business 
we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes 
our primary exposures have related to operating expenses and sales in australia  asia and europe that were not united states dollar denominated 
historically  these risks were minimal for us  but as our international revenues and operations have grown and continue to grow  the adverse currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the increasing use of the euro as a common currency for members of the european union could affect our foreign exchange exposure 
our workforce reductions may require us to reduce our facilities commitments  which may cause us to incur expenses or recognize additional financial statement charges 
since june   we have reduced our worldwide employee headcount by more than 
in connection with our restructuring plans and the merger with imanage  we relocated offices and abandoned facilities in the san francisco bay area  new york city  boston and austin  texas 
as a result  we are paying for facilities that we are not using and have no future plans to use 
for the years ended december   and  we have recorded charges for excess facilities  net of expected sublease income  in the amount of million  million and million  respectively  and at december   we have an accrual for excess facilities of million  which is net of anticipated sublease income of million 
if the commercial real estate market continues to deteriorate  or if we cannot sublease these excess facilities at all  we may be required to record additional charges for excess facilities or revise our estimate of future sublease income in the future which may be material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
our estimates of future sublease income related to our restructuring and excess facilities charges may be incorrect and may require us to incur expenses or recognize additional financial statement charges 
in connection with our restructuring and excess facilities charges  we made certain estimates of expected future sublease income for our abandoned facilities 
although  for most of our excess facilities  we are actively marketing these facilities for sublease  we may be unable to sublease our excess facilities and even if we are successful in subleasing the excess facilities  we may be required to accept significantly less in rent from a subtenant than our lease rate 
if the commercial real estate market continues to deteriorate  or if we cannot sublease these excess facilities at all  we may be required to record additional charges to revise our estimates of future sublease income  which could result in additional expenses we would incur  as well as financial statement charges which may be material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
if our products cannot scale to meet the demands of tens of thousands of concurrent users  our targeted customers may not license our solutions  which will cause our revenues to decline 
our strategy is to target large organizations that require our enterprise content management software solution because of the significant amounts of information and content that they generate and use 
for this strategy to succeed  our software products must be highly scalable and accommodate tens of thousands of concurrent users 
if our products cannot scale to accommodate a large number of concurrent users  our target markets will not accept our products and our business and operating results will suffer 
if our customers cannot successfully implement large scale deployments  or if they determine that our products cannot accommodate large scale deployments  our customers will not license our solutions  and this will materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and operating results 

table of contents if our products do not operate with a wide variety of hardware  software and operating systems used by our customers  our revenues would be harmed 
we currently serve a customer base that uses a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  software applications and operating systems 
for example  we have designed our products to work with databases and servers developed by microsoft corporation  sun microsystems  inc  oracle corporation and ibm and software applications including microsoft office  wordperfect  lotus notes and novell groupwise 
we must continually modify and enhance our software products to keep pace with changes in computer hardware and software and database technology as well as emerging technical standards in the software industry 
we further believe that our application suite will gain broad market acceptance only if it can support a wide variety of hardware  software applications and systems 
if our products were unable to support a variety of these products  our business would be harmed 
additionally  customers could delay purchases of our application suite until they determine how our products will operate with these updated platforms or applications 
our products currently operate on the microsoft windows nt  microsoft windows  linux  ibm aix  hewlett packard ux and sun solaris operating environments 
if other platforms become more widely used  we could be required to convert our server application products to additional platforms 
we may not succeed in these efforts  and even if we do  potential customers may not choose to license our product 
in addition  our products are required to interoperate with leading content authoring tools and application servers 
we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in these applications and operating systems 
if our products were to be incompatible with a popular new operating system or business application  our business could be harmed 
also  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications by vendors of operating systems  browsers  back office applications  and other technology related applications  could also harm our business 
our failure to deliver defect free software could result in losses and harmful publicity 
our software products are complex and have in the past and may in the future contain defects or failures that may be detected at any point in the product s life 
we have discovered software defects in the past in some of our products after their release 
although past defects have not had a material effect on our results of operations  in the future we may experience delays or lost revenues caused by new defects 
despite our testing  defects and errors may still be found in new or existing products  and may result in delayed or lost revenues  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  reduced customer satisfaction  diversion of development resources and damage to our reputation 
as has occurred in the past  new releases of products or product enhancements may require us to provide additional services under our support contracts to ensure proper installation and implementation 
errors in our application suite may be caused by defects in third party software incorporated into our application suite 
if so  we may not be able to fix these defects without the cooperation of these software providers 
since these defects may not be as significant to our software providers as they are to us  we may not receive the rapid cooperation that we may require 
we may not have the contractual right to access the source code of third party software and  even if we access the source code  we may not be able to fix the defect 
as customers rely on our products for critical business applications  errors  defects or other performance problems of our products or services might result in damage to the businesses of our customers 
consequently  these customers could delay or withhold payment to us for our software and services  which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts or an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable  both of which could disappoint investors and result in a significant decline in our stock price 
in addition  these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses 
even if unsuccessful  a product liability claim brought against us would likely be time consuming and costly and harm our reputation  and thus our ability to license products to new customers 
even if a suit is not brought  correcting errors in our application suite could increase our expenses 
difficulties in introducing new products and upgrades in a timely manner will make market acceptance of our products less likely 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and technology related enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
we expect to add new content management functionality to our product offerings by internal development and 
table of contents possibly by acquisition 
content management technology is more complex than most software and new products or product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
any delays in developing and releasing new products could harm our business 
new products or upgrades may not be released according to schedule or may contain defects when released 
either situation could result in adverse publicity  loss of sales  delay in market acceptance of our products or customer claims against us  any of which could harm our business 
if we do not develop  license or acquire new software products  or deliver enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost effective basis  our business will be harmed 
our products may lack essential functionality if we are unable to obtain and maintain licenses to third party software and applications 
we rely on software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with our internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
the functionality of our software products  therefore  depends on our ability to integrate these third party technologies into our products 
furthermore  we may license additional software from third parties in the future to add functionality to our products 
if our efforts to integrate this third party software into our products are not successful  our customers may not license our products and our business will suffer 
in addition  we would be seriously harmed if the providers from whom we license software ceased to deliver and support reliable products  enhance their current products or respond to emerging industry standards 
moreover  the third party software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
each of these license agreements may be renewed only with the other party s written consent 
the loss of  or inability to maintain or obtain licensed software  could result in shipment delays or reductions 
furthermore  we may be forced to limit the features available in our current or future product offerings 
either alternative could seriously harm our business and operating results 
new legislation  higher insurance cost and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to impact our future consolidated financial position and results of operations 
recently  there have been significant regulatory changes  including the sarbanes oxley act of  and there may be new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings that will have an impact on our future consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the sarbanes oxley act of and other rule changes and proposed legislative initiatives following several highly publicized corporate accounting and corporate governance failures are likely to increase general and administrative costs 
in addition  insurance companies significantly increased insurance rates as a result of higher claims over the past year  and our rates for our various insurance policies increased substantially 
further  proposed initiatives may result in changes in accounting rules  including legislative and other proposals to account for employee stock options as an expense 
these and other potential changes could materially increase the expenses we report under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and adversely affect our consolidated operating results 
we are the target of a securities class action and other litigation  which could result in substantial costs and divert management attention and resources 
beginning  interwoven and certain of our officers and directors and certain investment banking firms  were separately named as defendants in a purported securities class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court southern district of new york  which was subsequently consolidated with more than substantially identical proceedings against other companies 
similar suits were named against imanage  its directors and certain of its officers 
the consolidated complaint asserts that the prospectuses for our october  initial public offering  our january  follow on public offering and imanage s november  initial public offering  failed to disclose certain alleged actions by the underwriters for the offerings 
in addition  the consolidated complaint alleges claims under section and of the securities act of against imanage and us and certain of imanage s and our officers and directors 
the plaintiff seeks damages in an unspecified amount 
in june  following the dismissal of imanage s and our respective officers and directors from the litigation without prejudice and after several months of negotiation  the plaintiffs named in the consolidated compliant and imanage and interwoven  together with the other issuers named there under and their respective insurance carriers  agreed to settle the litigation and dispose of any remaining claims against the issuers named in the consolidated compliant  in each case without admitting any wrongdoing 
as part of this settlement  imanage s and our 
table of contents respective insurance carriers have agreed to assume imanage s and our entire payment obligation under the terms of the settlement 
this settlement will be presented to the district court for approval in the coming months  however  we cannot assure you that the district court will approve the settlement 
in october  a former employee of imanage filed the first amended complaint in the circuit court of cook county  illinois against imanage and certain of its then current executive officers 
the complaint alleges the plaintiff s entitlement to  shares of imanage common stock that were never issued  breach of contract  breach of fiduciary duty and fraudulent concealment 
the plaintiff is seeking damages of approximately  plus unspecified punitive damages 
while we believe that the allegations against imanage and its former officers and directors are without merit  and intend to contest this matter vigorously  we cannot assure you that this matter will be resolved without costly litigation or in a manner that is not adverse to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are a party to other threatened legal actions arising from the normal course of business activities 
in management s opinion  resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or our financial position 
however  depending on the amount and timing  an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations  cash flows or financial position in a particular period 
we might not be able to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  a loss of which could harm our business 
we depend upon our proprietary technology and rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions to protect it 
we currently have issued united states patents and foreign patents  as well as several united states and foreign patents pending approval 
it is possible that patents will not be issued from our currently pending patent applications or any future patent application we may file 
we also have restricted customer access to our source code and require all employees enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as effectively as the laws of the united states and we expect that it will become more difficult to monitor use of our products as we increase our international presence 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
any such resulting litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
further  third parties may claim that our products infringe the intellectual property of their products 
any claims  with or without merit  could be costly and time consuming to defend  divert our management s attention or cause product delays 
if our product was found to infringe a third party s proprietary rights  we could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to be able to sell our product 
royalty and licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  which could harm our business 
charges to earnings and a reduction in deferred revenue resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting may adversely affect the market value of our common stock following our merger with imanage 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we accounted for the merger using the purchase method of accounting  which resulted in charges to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock following the merger 
under the purchase method of accounting  we allocated the total estimated purchase price to our net tangible assets  amortizable intangible assets  intangible assets with indefinite lives and in process research and development based on their fair values as of the date of the closing of the merger and recorded the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill 
the portion of the estimated purchase price allocated to purchased in process technology was expensed in the quarter in which the merger was completed 
we will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with the merger and significant stock based compensation expense 
in addition  to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired  we may be required to incur material charges related to the impairment of those assets 
these depreciation  amortization and potential impairment charges could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
furthermore  under the purchase method of accounting  imanage s deferred revenues related to customer support for license arrangements in which payment had been received or was legally due and payable was reduced to the fair value of the related customer support obligation as of the 
table of contents effective time of the merger 
as a result  we will not be able to recognize approximately million of imanage deferred revenues due to the adjustment to reflect deferred revenues at the estimated fair value of the related post contract customer support obligation as of november  further  we have million in net goodwill and million in net other intangible assets at december   we believe our goodwill and other intangible assets are recoverable 
however  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets 
we must continue to monitor those assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets 
any adverse change in our recoverability assumptions could result in the writing down of our intangible assets  which could materially impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we may be required to write off all or a portion of the goodwill value of companies acquired 
generally accepted accounting principles in the united states require companies to review the value of acquired assets from time to time to determine whether those values have been impaired 
as a result  we are required periodically to review the value reported on our balance sheet of companies we have acquired  to determine if those values should be reduced 
in connection with our review  we reduced by recorded goodwill by million 
we may in the future be required to write down the carrying value of goodwill assets  including goodwill associated with our merger with imanage 
if we determine there has been an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of those assets will be written down to fair value  and a charge against operating results in the period that the determination is made 
any impairment harms our consolidated operating results and financial position  and could harm the price of our stock 
there may be sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the near future that could cause our stock price to fall 
some of our current stockholders hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock  which they are able to sell in the public market  subject to restrictions under the securities laws and regulations 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock within a short period of time could cause our stock price to fall 
moreover  two of our executive officers have established systematic plans under which they will sell a pre determined number of shares per quarter  provided that a certain minimum price is obtained 
these plans may be perceived poorly in the market together with the increased number of shares being made available on the market 
these plans may have an adverse effect on our share price 
the executive officer may also sell stock outside of the systematic plan at his election 
other executive officers are considering similar systematic sale programs 
in addition  a fall in our stock price could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the fair value of cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk and the average interest rate as of december  dollars in thousands cash equivalents and short term investments average interest rate the following table presents the fair value of cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk and the average interest rate as of december  dollars in thousands cash equivalents and short term investments average interest rate 
table of contents our cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
as of december   we had net unrealized gains of  associated with these securities 
assuming an average investment balance of million  if interest rates were to increase decrease by  this would result in a  increase decrease in annual interest income 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize an adverse impact on income or cash flows 
as of december   we did not hold derivative financial instruments and have never held such instruments in the past 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings under equipment lines of credit totaling million 
foreign currency risk the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in united states dollars 
as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we do expect transactions in foreign currencies in  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant 
we have engaged in limited and immaterial amount of foreign currency forward contract activities to date 
commodity price risk we did not hold commodity instruments as of december   and have never had such instruments in the past
