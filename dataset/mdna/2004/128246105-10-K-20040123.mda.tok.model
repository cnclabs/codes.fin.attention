item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risks related to our business beginning on page and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leader in the distribution of avocados  processed avocado products  and other perishable food products throughout the united states and elsewhere in the world 
our history and expertise in handling california grown avocados has allowed us to develop a reputation of delivering quality products  at competitive prices  while providing a competitive return to our growers 
this reputation has enabled us to expand our product offering to include avocados sourced on an international basis  processed avocado products  and other perishable foods 
we report these operations in three business segments california avocados  international avocados and other perishable food products and processed products 
we report our financial results on a november to october fiscal year basis to coincide with the california avocado harvest season 
our california avocado business grades  sizes  packs and cools avocados grown in california for delivery to our customers 
we presently operate two packinghouses in southern california 
these packinghouses handled approximately of the california hass avocado crop during the fiscal year  based on data obtained from the california avocado commission 
our operating results and the returns we pay our growers are highly dependent on the volume of avocados delivered to our packinghouses  as a significant portion of our costs are fixed 
our strategy calls for continued efforts in aggressively recruiting new growers  retaining existing growers and procuring a larger percentage of the california avocado crop to improve our results from operations 
our international and perishable food products business procures avocados grown in mexico  chile  new zealand  and the dominican republic  as well as papayas grown in hawaii 
we operate a packinghouse in mexico that handled approximately of the mexican avocado crop bound for the united states market during the mexican harvest season  based on our estimates 
additionally  during the chilean avocado harvest season  we handled approximately of the chilean avocado crop  based on our estimates 
our strategy is to procure and sell the internationally grown avocados to complement our distribution efforts in support of california grown avocados 
we believe that the introduction of these avocados  although competitive at times with california grown avocados  provides a level of supply stability that may  over time  help solidify the demand for avocados among consumers in the united states and elsewhere in the world 
we believe our efforts in distributing papayas grown in hawaii complement our offerings of avocados 
from time to time  we continue to explore distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to the business 
our processed products business procures avocados  processes avocados into a wide variety of guacamole products  and distributes the processed product to our customers 
during fiscal  we operated a processing plant in mexico and a second facility in southern california 
the second facility  however  was closed in february in conjunction with the relocation of our processed business to our new  under construction  facility in uruapan  michoacan  mexico 
we anticipate this facility will be completed near the end of our first fiscal quarter in our customers include both food service industry and retail businesses 
our strategy calls for the development of new guacamole recipes and other processed avocado products that address the diverse taste of today s consumers 
we also seek to expand our relationships with major food service companies and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace 
our california avocado and international and perishable food product businesses are highly seasonal and are characterized by rapid crop volume and price changes 
furthermore  the operating results of all of our businesses  including our processed product business  have been  and will continue to be  affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors  such as pests and disease  weather patterns  changes in demand by consumers  the timing of the receipt  reduction  or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  our ability to develop  introduce  and market new products on a timely basis  availability and cost of avocados and supplies from growers and vendors  new product introductions by our competitors  change in the mix of avocados and processed products we sell  and general economic conditions 
we believe  however  that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future 

table of contents on october   we completed a series of transactions whereby common and preferred shareholders of calavo growers of california  an agricultural marketing cooperative association  exchanged all of their outstanding shares for shares of our common stock 
concurrently with this transaction  the cooperative was merged into us with calavo emerging as the surviving entity 
these transactions had the effect of converting the legal structure of the business from a non profit cooperative to a for profit corporation 
the merger and the conversion were approved on an overwhelming basis by both the cooperative s shareholders and our board of directors 
prior to the merger  the cooperative reported results of operations as constituting either member the packing and distribution of avocados procured from either members or associate members or non member business non member business included both the processed product business and the sourcing and distribution of all crops that were not procured from the cooperative s members 
we have realigned our businesses to combine within our california avocado segment the results of operations of both the california avocados grown previously by members and those that were procured from non members 
we believe that this presentation provides an enhanced view of the results of our california operations and a better framework to evaluate the results of our various operations 
recent developments dividend payment in january  we paid a per share dividend in the aggregate amount of  to shareholders of record in november stock options during the year ended october    stock options were exercised for proceeds totaling  in december  our board of directors approved the issuance of options to acquire a total of  shares of our common stock to two members of our board of directors 
each option to acquire  shares vests in substantially equal installments over a year period  has an exercise price of per share and has a term of years from the grant date 
the market price of our common stock at the grant date was 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  we will record compensation expense of approximately  over the vesting period of three years from the grant date 
purchase commitment in may  we entered into a commitment to purchase approximately million pounds of processed avocado products from a supplier for a cost of approximately million over a month period 
through december  we have received substantially all products subject to this commitment 
acquisition in order to diversify our product lines and increase synergies within the marketplace  we acquired all the outstanding common shares of maui fresh international  inc maui for  shares of our common stock valued at million in november maui  which generated approximately million in revenues during its fiscal year ended december   is a specialty produce company servicing a wide array of retail  food service  and terminal market wholesale customers with over different specialty commodities 
the value of our common stock issued in conjunction with the acquisition was based on the average quoted market price of our common stock for days before and after the announcement date 
as security for certain potential contingencies  such as unrecorded liabilities  we are entitled to hold approximately  shares issued in conjunction with such acquisition for one full year from the acquisition date 
in the event that these contingencies resolve as we expect them to  we will be obligated to return these shares 

table of contents the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition 
such estimates are preliminary and are subject to change upon receipt of valuation information november in thousands preliminary fixed assets goodwill and intangible assets total assets acquired current liabilities net assets acquired goodwill is not subject to amortization and is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
processed product segment restructuring in february  our board of directors approved a plan whereby the operations of our processed products business will be relocated 
the plan calls for the closing of our santa paula  california and mexicali  baja california norte processing facilities and the relocation of these operations to a new facility in uruapan  michoacan  mexico 
we believe that this restructuring will provide cost savings in the elimination of certain transportation costs  duplicative overhead structures  and savings in the overall cost of labor and services 
we anticipate that the facility will be completed near the end of our first fiscal quarter the santa paula facility closed in february we plan to close the mexicali facility during calendar year  but no firm closing date has yet been determined 
through october   we have incurred costs related to this restructuring approximating  our income statement for the year ended october  includes  as cost of sales   as special charges  and  as selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs are comprised of the following components as of and for the year ended october  reserves special amounts non cash remaining in thousands charges paid charges to be utilized employee separation costs write down of fixed assets net book value of total special charges selling  general and administrative freight cost of sales facility operating costs special charges recorded through october  consist entirely of employee separation costs and write downs of fixed assets 
all employee separation costs were paid in cash and represent final payments to production and managerial employees formerly working at our santa paula  california processing facility 
we expect to pay additional employee separation costs in connection with our planned future closure of our mexicali  baja california norte production facility  which will be recognized when incurred  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
those costs have not yet been quantified and are expected to be accrued for and paid during fiscal year costs related to the write down of fixed assets represent a non cash charge to reduce the carrying value of production assets located at our santa paula  california processed facility to their fair value 
these write downs were primarily the result of fixed assets no longer being used in the production process 
as of october   we have not accrued for any charges relating to the write down of production assets being held at our mexicali  baja california norte production facility as it is anticipated that all such assets will be re commissioned at our new facility in uruapan  michoacan or their carrying value is less than their net realizable value 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  
table of contents liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables  inventories  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  promotional allowances  income taxes  retirement benefits  and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
advances to suppliers 
we advance funds to third party growers primarily in california  chile and mexico for various farming needs 
these advances are generally secured with a crop lien or other collateral owned by the grower 
we continuously evaluate the ability of these growers to repay advances and the fair value of the collateral in order to evaluate the possible need to record an allowance 
promotional allowances 
we provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale  based on our historical experience 
our estimates are generally based on evaluating the average length of time between the product shipment date and the date on which we pay the customer the promotional allowance 
the product of this lag factor and our historical promotional allowance payment rate is the basis for the promotional allowance included in accrued expenses on our balance sheet 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the period they are identified 
cash rebates are generally earned by our customers upon achievement of volume purchases or by corporate customers for purchases made by their affiliated subsidiaries 
cash rebates  as well as all other sales incentives that result in a reduction in  or refund of  the selling price at the time of sale  have been classified as a reduction of sales 
net sales 
we recognize sales once they are realizable and earned 
sales of products and related costs of products sold are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has been made  title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
perishable product sales are recorded when the product is shipped  title passes  and the sales price is known 
sales from processed products are recorded when the product is shipped and title and risk passes 
service revenue  including freight  ripening  storage  bagging and palletization charges  is recorded when services are performed and sales of the related products are delivered 
allowance for customer deductions 
we provide an allowance for customer deductions and receivable balances remaining  after partial invoice payments  based on historical experience and the aging of the related accounts receivable 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income  expressed as percentages of our total net sales  for the periods indicated year ended october  net sales gross margins selling  general and administrative operating income other expense income  net net income 
table of contents net sales we believe that the fundamentals for our products continue to be favorable 
government census studies continue to indicate a shift in the demographics of the us population in which larger portions of the population descend from a hispanic origin 
avocados are considered a staple item purchased by hispanic consumers and their acceptance as part of american cuisine continues to spur demand for our products 
we anticipate avocado products will further penetrate the united states marketplace driven by growth in the hispanic community and general acceptance in american cuisine 
as the largest marketer of avocado products in the united states  we believe that we are well positioned to leverage this trend and to grow all segments of our business 
we recognize sales of perishable products when the product is shipped  title and risk passes  and the market price is known 
service revenue  including freight  ripening  and palletization charges  are recorded when services are performed and or the product is shipped 
we generally recognize sales from processed product sales directly to our customers upon shipment and transfer of title and risk 
we provide for sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment  based on our experience 
the following table summarizes our net sales by business segment change change dollars in thousands net sales california avocados international avocados and perishable food products processed products eliminations total net sales as a percentage of net sales california avocados international avocados and perishable food products processed products net sales for the year ended october   when compared to  grew by approximately million  or  principally as a result of growth experienced by our international avocados and perishable food products and our processed products segments  partially offset by a decrease in our california avocados segment 
in particular  growth in our net sales reflects an increasing percentage of our business being generated by our international avocados and perishable food product segments 
net sales generated by our international avocados and perishable food products business depends principally on the availability of chilean and mexican grown avocados in the us markets 
currently  mexican grown avocados are significant during our first two fiscal quarters 
chilean grown avocados are significant during our st and th fiscal quarters 
we are presently reviewing the impact  if any  of the pest risk assessment issued by the usda during fiscal  which  if adopted as drafted  would lift current import limitations on hass avocados from mexico 
the marketing of the mexican avocados is presently limited to states  from the middle of october to the middle of april 
this directive is intended to analyze the risks associated with expanding the importation of mexican avocados to all us states for the entire year 
we believe that this assessment will be adopted  in a form substantially similar to its draft form  during our fiscal we are unable to project the impact  if any  the adoption of this proposed assessment will have on our financial condition and results of operations 
notwithstanding the aforementioned pest risk assessment  we anticipate the continuation of growth in our international avocados and perishable food product segment for fiscal additionally  we anticipate slightly increasing sales in our processed products business and also anticipate continued growth in net sales generated from value added bagging and ripening services  as well as the need to promote our products with additional sales incentives 
we also anticipate that sales generated from our california avocados and international avocados and perishable food products segments will continue to represent the majority of total net sales and the percentage of total net sales generated from these segments may increase in the future

all intercompany sales are eliminated in our consolidated results of operations 
california avocados net sales delivered by the business decreased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to the decrease in fiscal sales primarily reflects a decrease in avocados delivered by our growers of  or million pounds  partially offset by a significant improvement in the average selling prices of avocados when compared to fiscal the decrease in delivered pounds is consistent with the decrease in the overall harvest of the california avocado crop for the season  as well as a shift in growing areas where we do not command as significant a market share 
despite this decrease in volume  we have continued to maintain our leadership role in packing and marketing california grown avocados 
our market share of first grade hass variety avocados was approximately and during fiscal and for the season  we attribute such decrease in market share primarily to the aforementioned shift into growing areas where we do not command as significant a market share among growers 

table of contents average selling prices  on a per carton basis  for first grade hass variety avocados for fiscal were higher when compared to fiscal we attribute some of the increase in these average selling prices to increasing demand for california grown avocados in the us marketplace and a reduced volume of avocados 
we believe that our investments in focused marketing activities  combined with promotional programs established by the california avocado commission  have generally had a positive effect on average sales prices 
our strategy is to continue to develop marketing opportunities that favorably position avocados packed by calavo with our customers by emphasizing existing value added services  such as fruit bagging and ripening 
we believe that these and other value added strategies are critical elements in sustaining competitive average selling prices 
net sales delivered by the business increased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to the increase in fiscal sales reflects a significant improvement in the average selling prices of avocados when compared to fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in avocados delivered by our growers of  or million pounds 
the decrease in delivered pounds was consistent with the expected decrease in the overall harvest of the california avocado crop for the season 
despite this decrease in volume  we continued to build on our leadership role in packing and marketing california grown avocados and maintained a strong market share of first grade hass variety avocados during fiscal our market share of first grade hass variety avocados was approximately and during fiscal and average selling prices  on a per carton basis  for first grade hass variety avocados for fiscal were higher when compared to fiscal we attribute some of the increase in these average selling prices to increasing demand for california grown avocados in the us marketplace and a slightly reduced volume of avocados 
in october  the usda announced the creation of a hass avocado board to promote the sale of hass variety avocados in the us marketplace 
the california avocado commission  which receives its funding from california avocado growers  has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales 
the new hass avocado board now provides a basis for a unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the us marketplace including imported and california grown fruit 
we believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the us will  in the long term  positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our california avocado and international avocado businesses 
during fiscal  we remitted approximately million to the hass avocado board 
international and perishable food products for fiscal  net sales include approximately million of value added services billed by our mexican subsidiaries to the parent company  which are eliminated from our consolidated financial results 
for fiscal  when compared to fiscal  net sales to third party customers increased by approximately million  or  from million to million 
the increased sales to third parties by our international and perishable foods products business were primarily driven by a greater volume of chilean and mexican grown avocados penetrating into the us  japan and europe marketplaces 
the volume of fruit handled increased by million pounds of chilean grown avocados  or  and million pounds of mexican grown avocados  or  for fiscal when compared to fiscal pricing during fiscal was fairly stable as well  when compared to fiscal during fiscal  we sourced a significantly greater volume of mexican grown avocados from our uruapan  mexico packinghouse 
during fiscal  the volume of fruit related to shipments to the us marketplace increased by approximately million pounds  or  as compared to fiscal in addition  net sales resulting from the sale of mexican grown avocados were also favorably impacted by increased demand from japanese and european customers 
during fiscal  the volume of fruit related to shipments to japan and europe increased by approximately million pounds  or  as compared to fiscal we believe that sales of mexican grown avocados will continue to show a growing trend 
we intend to leverage our position as the largest packer of mexican grown avocados for export markets to improve the overall performance of this business

table of contents processed products for fiscal  net sales include approximately million of value added services billed by our mexican subsidiaries to the parent company  which are eliminated from our consolidated financial results 
net sales to third party customers increased by approximately million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in fiscal net sales to third party customers is primarily attributable to an increase in million pounds of product sold  or  an increase in the sales price per product pound sold of  and a decrease in sales incentives and promotional activities paid of million or 
during fiscal  we experienced an increase in demand for our frozen processed products as one of our competitors exited from the business 
as a result of the increase in demand for our product  we decreased our sales incentives and promotional activities paid 
during fiscal  we purchased and commissioned new ultra high pressure treatment equipment designed to manufacture processed avocado products that are not frozen 
through october   our high pressure line consisted of one ultra high pressure machine manufacturing guacamole in mexicali 
this machine was commissioned for operations in october and ran near capacity during fiscal utilizing avocado pulp and chunks  this high pressure equipment allows us to deliver fresh guacamole to retail and food service customers 
sales of our high pressure product totaled approximately million for fiscal year we did not have significant sales of our high pressure product during fiscal we are presently installing a second  much larger  high pressure machine in our new facility being built in uruapan  michoacan  mexico 
we anticipate commissioning this second machine for operations during our second fiscal quarter of  but we do not believe this machine will operate near capacity until near the end of fiscal we believe that the introduction of these fresh guacamole products will  in the long term  successfully address a growing market segment 
for fiscal and  net sales include approximately million and million of value added services billed by our mexican subsidiaries to the parent company  which are eliminated from our consolidated financial results 
net sales to third party customers decreased by approximately million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the decrease in fiscal net sales to third party customers is attributable to a decrease in million pounds of product sold  or  and an increase in sales incentives and promotional activities paid of million or 

gross margins the following table summarizes our gross margins and gross profit percentages by business segment change change dollars in thousands gross margins california avocados international avocados and perishable food products processed products total gross margins gross profit percentages california avocados international avocados and perishable food products processed products consolidated our cost of goods sold consists predominantly of fruit costs  packing materials  freight and handling  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with preparing food products  and other direct expenses pertaining to products sold 
gross margins decreased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to  principally as a result of decreases in the gross profit percentages realized by our california avocado and processed products segments  which were partially offset by increased gross profit percentages achieved by our international avocado and perishable food products segment 
gross margins increased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to  principally as a result of increases in the gross profit percentages realized by our california avocado and international avocado and perishable food products segments  which were partially offset by decreased gross profit percentages achieved by our processed products segment 

table of contents gross margins and gross profit percentages for our california avocado business are largely dependent on production yields achieved at our packinghouses  current market prices of avocados  and the volume of avocados packed 
the decrease in our gross margin percentage during fiscal is primarily related to a higher average return per pound paid to our growers 
our growers received an average return of per pound  as compared to per pound in fiscal the volume of avocados delivered by our growers decreased  however  by approximately million pounds 
during fiscal  our growers received an average return of per pound  as compared to per pound in fiscal  whereas the volume of avocados delivered decreased by approximately million pounds 
during fiscal  freight and handling costs decreased by approximately million  from million in fiscal to million during fiscal during fiscal  freight and handling costs decreased by approximately million  from million in fiscal to million during fiscal we continue to review our packinghouse processes for potential improvements in packing efficiencies and more favorable production yields 
the gross margin and gross profit percentage for our international avocado and perishable food products business are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third party domestic packers 
for example  the gross margins we earn on avocados procured from chile  new zealand  and the dominican republic  as well as papayas grown in hawaii  are generally based on a commission agreed to with each packer that is subject to incentive provisions 
these provisions provide for us to deliver returns to these domestic packers that are competitive with those delivered by other handlers 
accordingly  the gross margin results for this business are a function of the volume handled and the competitiveness of the sales prices that we realize as compared to others 
for fiscal  we generated gross margins of million from the sale of fresh produce products that were domestically packed by third parties  whereas gross margins for fiscal were only million 
for fiscal  we generated gross margins of million from the sale of fresh produce products that were domestically packed by third parties  whereas gross margins for fiscal were only million 
our business with mexican growers differs in that we operate a packinghouse in mexico and purchase avocados directly from the field 
consequently  the gross margin and gross profit percentages generated by our mexican operations are significantly impacted by the volume of avocados handled by our packinghouse 
during fiscal  our gross margins generated from the sale of mexican avocados improved from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal  principally as a result of increases in the pounds packed at our facility 
these efficiencies  however  were adversely affected via the introduction of the new per pound marketing assessment imposed on avocados imported into the united states 
during fiscal  our gross margins generated from the sale of mexican avocados improved from a negative margin of approximately million in fiscal to a positive margin of million in fiscal principally as a result of increases in the pounds packed at our facility 
gross margins and gross profit percentages for our processed products business are largely dependent on the pricing of our final product and the cost of avocados used in preparing guacamole 
during fiscal  the decrease in the gross margin percentage is primarily related to higher fruit costs  as well as inefficiencies related to the relocation of production from santa paula  california and mexicali  mexico to our newly constructed facility in uruapan  mexico 
additionally  as a result of the closure of our santa paula processed facility and greater then expected increase in demand for our products  we have been depleting our inventory at a rate greater than initially planned 
therefore  we entered into agreements and or discussions with two processed avocado product suppliers to supplement our existing inventory levels 
this had the effect of decreasing our gross margin percentage due to higher costs and inefficiencies related to sourcing this product from outside suppliers 
during fiscal to  the cost of avocados used in the preparation of our processed products decreased by  principally due to lower prices for avocados having the necessary quality for preparing our processed products 
selling  general and administrative change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses include costs of marketing and advertising  sales expenses  and other general and administrative costs
