these chemicals which include insecticides  fungicides  molluscicides  growth regulators  and soil fumigants  are marketed in liquid  powder  and granular forms 
amvac s business is continually undergoing an evolutionary change 
years ago amvac considered itself a distributor formulator  but now amvac primarily manufactures  distributes  and formulates its own proprietary products or custom manufactures or formulates for others 
in january  amvac entered into an agreement with syngenta crop protection syngenta to supply force g for use through amvac s smartbox system beginning in the season 
force g is a corn soil insecticide manufactured and marketed by syngenta for the control of corn rootworm  wireworm  cutworm and white grub in cotton 
in december  amvac acquired certain assets related to the active ingredient dichlorvos ddvp used in the animal health business and marketed primarily under the trade name nuvan from novartis animal health  inc a business unit of novartis ag 
since  amvac has manufactured a technical form of ddvp  used primarily in specialty markets as a broad spectrum household and specialty insecticide

in january  amvac acquired certain assets associated with the evital g cranberry herbicide business conducted in the united states from syngenta 
in july  amvac acquired from flowserve us inc flowserve  all or substantially all of its assets associated with the smartbox closed delivery system 
the smartbox system electronically dispenses granular crop protection products  replacing older technology that utilizes mechanically driven sprockets and chains 
the state of the art smartbox technology allows farmers to apply crop protection products accurately and efficiently while avoiding contact with the product 
the computer controller enables farmers to monitor and change application rates while planting and provides the farmer with a permanent record of application 
initially the smartbox system was developed by flowserve in partnership with ei dupont de nemours and company dupont and zeneca  inc which partnership commenced in at the same time it acquired certain assets associated with the fortress corn soil insecticide business from dupont in  amvac assumed dupont s smartbox partnership interest 
thereafter  zeneca  inc abandoned its smartbox partnership interest 
in amvac sold its fortress g active ingredient chlorethoxyfoxs corn soil insecticide to the american farmer in the smartbox system 
later that year  amvac secured exclusive marketing rights in the us bayer cropscience s aztec g corn soil insecticide which also can be applied through the smartbox system 
by offering both products  amvac provides farmers a choice of two different chemistries to apply through the smartbox system 
this allows farmers to rotate products from year to year  thereby preventing insects from building resistance to any one specific product 
amvac is currently looking at utilizing this system for other crops where the safety features of the system would provide an important benefit 
in july  amvac acquired from syngenta all us environmental protection agency epa end use product registrations and data support as well as a license to the ambush wp trademark wettable powder formulation in the united states

seasonality the agricultural chemical industry in general is cyclical in nature 
the demand for amvac s products tends to be slightly seasonal 
seasonal usage  however  does not necessarily follow calendar dates  but more closely follows varying growing seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
backlog the company does not believe that backlog is a significant factor in its business 
the company primarily sells its products on the basis of purchase orders  although it has entered into requirements contracts with certain customers 
customers helena chemical company and con agra  inc accounted for each of the company s sales in conagra  inc  agriliance and helena chemical company accounted for  and  respectively of the company s sales in conagra  inc accounted for of the company s sales in conagra  agriliance and helena are distributors of the company s products 
competition amvac faces competition from many domestic and foreign manufacturers in its marketplaces 
competition in amvac s marketplace is based primarily on efficacy  price  safety and ease of application 
many of such competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than amvac 
amvac s ability to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products and expand its product lines and customer base 
amvac competes principally on the basis of price  the quality of its products and the technical service and support given to its customers 
the inability of amvac to effectively compete in several of amvac s principal products would have a material adverse effect on amvac s results of operations 

table of contents generally  the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope  there being more than one way or one product for treatment  eradication  or suppression 
the company has attempted to position amvac in smaller niche markets which are no longer of strong focus to larger companies 
these markets are small by nature  require significant and intensive management input  ongoing product research  and are near product maturity 
these types of markets tend not to attract larger chemical companies due to the smaller volume demand  and larger chemical companies have been divesting themselves of products that fall into such niches as is evidenced by amvac s successful acquisitions of nuvan  dacthal  fortress  dibrom  vapam  bidrin and naa 
intellectual property amvac s proprietary product formulations are protected  to the extent possible  as trade secrets and  to a lesser extent  by patents and trademarks 
although amvac considers that  in the aggregate  its trademarks  licenses  and patents constitute a valuable asset  it does not regard its business as being materially dependent upon any single or several trademarks  licenses  or patents 
epa registrations amvac s products also receive protection afforded by the effect of the fifra legislation that makes it unlawful to sell any pesticide in the united states unless such pesticide has first been registered by the epa as well as under similar state laws 
substantially all of amvac s products are subject to epa registration and re registration requirements and are conditionally registered in accordance with fifra 
this licensing by epa is based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when it is used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of amvac s products are used require a registration by that specific state before it can be marketed or used 
state registrations are renewed annually  as appropriate 
the epa and state agencies have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on registered products sold by amvac 
amvac  on its own behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  has  and is currently furnishing  certain required data relative to specific products 
under fifra  the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support us registrations 
this requirement results in operating expenses in such areas as testing and the production of new products 
amvac expensed   and  during  and respectively  related to gathering this information 
based on facts known today  amvac estimates it will spend approximately  in because scientific analyses are constantly improving  it cannot be determined with certainty whether or not new or additional tests may be required by the regulatory authorities 
additionally  while fifra good laboratory practice standards specify the minimum practices and procedures which must be followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity of data related to these tests submitted to the epa  there can be no assurance the epa will not request certain tests studies be repeated 
amvac expenses these costs on an incurred basis 
see also part ii  item of this annual report for discussions pertaining to research and development expenses 
raw materials the company utilizes numerous firms as well as internal sources to supply the various raw materials and components used by amvac in manufacturing its products 
many of these materials are readily available from domestic sources 
in those instances where there is a single source of supply or where the source is not domestic  the company seeks to secure its supply by either long term arrangements or advance purchases from its suppliers 
the company believes that it is considered to be a valued customer to such sole source suppliers 
recent increases in energy costs are expected to have an impact on the company 
the ultimate impact  of which  cannot be measured at this time

hawaii matters amvac and the company were served with complaints in february the actions were filed in the circuit court of the second circuit  state of hawaii entitled board of water supply of the county of maui v 
shell oil co  et 
al 
the suit named as defendants the company  amvac  shell oil company  the dow chemical company  occidental chemical company  occidental petroleum corporation  occidental chemical corporation  and brewer environmental industry  inc maui pineapple company was joined as a cross defendant 
the complaint alleged that between two and four of the board s wells had been contaminated with  dibromo chloropropane dbcp in excess of the maximum contaminant level 
on august   a global settlement was reached  which included the remediation of the existing contaminated wells in addition to the installation of filtration devices on other wells for the next forty years on the island of maui 
the cash settlement was three million dollars of which amvac s and the company s portion was  
as to matters independent of indemnity issues  the company recovered  from one of its insurers 
the settlement agreement obligates the defendants to pay for the ongoing operation and maintenance of the filtration devices for up to forty years 
the annual costs of operation and maintenance per well is estimated to be approximately  to be adjusted annually by the consumer price index 
the defendants are also obligated to pay between ninety and one hundred percent for the cost of the installation of filtration devices on other wells that may exceed the defined maximum contaminant level in the next forty years 
the number of future wells needing remediation could be less than six or more than that amount  however  the maximum number of wells subject to remediation under the agreement is fifty 
amvac s share of the ongoing operation and maintenance 
table of contents charges and installation of additional devices on other wells is seventeen and one half percent 
the obligations of the defendants under this agreement are secured by a twenty million dollar letter of credit obtained by dow chemical 
amvac will pay seventeen and one half percent of the annual cost of the letter of credit which does not have a material impact on the company s financial statements directly to dow chemical 
thus far  no additional wells have been remediated nor has there been ongoing operation and maintenance charges

american vanguard corporation has not been sued in these actions 
the ten named plaintiffs are citizens of four countries guatemala  costa rica  panama  and ecuador 
punitive damages are sought against each defendant 
the plaintiffs were banana workers and allege that they were exposed to dbcp in applying the product in their native countries 
the case was also filed as a class action on behalf of other workers so exposed in these four countries 
the plaintiffs attorneys from south carolina have also represented foreign banana workers in the texas and mississippi matters discussed below 
for the last six years  the focus of the case has been on procedural issues 
the defendants moved to dismiss under the doctrine of forum non conveniens 
under this doctrine  the foreign plaintiffs would have to sue in their own countries rather than using the united states courts 
the plaintiffs wish to keep the cases in the united states and have them remanded to state court 
the plaintiffs also contend that the federal court does not have jurisdiction 
in september  the court granted defendants motion to dismiss based on the grounds of forum non conveniens 
a number of conditions were imposed including consent to jurisdiction in the four foreign countries for the ten named plaintiffs  use of discovery taken in the united states  the requirement that the plaintiffs file suits in their home countries by december   and the agreement by defendants to pay any judgment  if any  that might be entered in the foreign countries 
the court order also provided that the plaintiffs could return to the united states if the foreign countries refused to accept jurisdiction

oral arguments were heard in the ninth circuit on august  the ninth circuit issued its decision on may   holding that the federal court did not have jurisdiction 
a petition for writ of certiorari a writ of a superior court to call up the records of an inferior court or quasi judicial body was filed in united states supreme court on october  and the united states supreme court subsequently granted a hearing 
oral argument was held on january  on april   the united states supreme court issued its decision in favor of the plaintiffs  holding there was no jurisdiction in federal court 
this vacates the order dismissing the case under the forum non conveniens doctrine 
one september   the us district court in honolulu issued an order that the case will be remanded to state court unless there is an objection filed by september  as the us supreme court has issued its final decision on the lack of federal court jurisdiction  the case will be remanded to state 
once the case reaches state court  the defendants will have to decide whether they will file a motion to dismiss under forum non conveniens pursuant to state court procedures 
the plaintiffs attorneys reported that the ten plaintiffs filed suit in their home countries by december   alleging in excess of two million united states dollars per plaintiff 
the suit in guatemala was served on amvac in march  but no defendant has been required to answer 
suits in the other countries have not been served 
amvac has engaged local attorneys in the countries to defend these foreign suits 
no discovery has taken place on the individual claims of the plaintiffs 
it is too early to provide any evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time 
without such discovery  it is unknown whether any of the plaintiffs was exposed to amvac brand dbcp or what statute of limitation defense may apply

and del monte fresh produce  na the cases were filed in the circuit court of harrison county  first judicial district of mississippi 
each case alleged damages sustained from injuries caused by plaintiffs who are former banana workers and citizens of a central american country exposure to dbcp while applying the product in their native countries 
these cases have been removed to us district court for the southern district of mississippi  southern division 
the federal court granted defense motions to dismiss in each case pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens 
unlike the patrickson case  the court did not establish detailed procedures or deadlines for the filing of suits in the foreign countries by the five plaintiffs 
defendants have learned that plaintiff valentin valdez has filed a suit in panama  but they have not been served 
on january   the court issued an unpublished decision  finding that there was jurisdiction in federal court  but remanded just one case espinola back to the trial court to determine if a stipulation which limited the plaintiff s recovery to fifty thousand dollars was binding 
if the stipulation is binding  that case will be remanded to state court 
if the stipulation is not binding  that case will be dismissed along with the others  requiring the plaintiffs to litigate in their native countries 
a deposition of the plaintiff espinola was scheduled but was never taken 
the federal court then ordered remand to state court 
the attorneys for dow chemical co 
filed a motion for reconsideration  explaining that the plaintiffs attorneys did not produce their client for deposition 
this motion is still pending 
no discovery has taken place on the individual claims of these plaintiffs 
if the espinola case is tried in mississippi state court  the maximum recovery is fifty thousand dollars 
without discovery  it is unknown whether any of the plaintiffs was exposed to the company s product or what statute of limitation defense may apply 
amvac intends to contest the cases vigorously 
it is too early to provide an evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time

louisiana matters in november  amvac was served with three complaints filed in the th judicial district court for the parish of st 
charles  state of louisiana entitled pedro rodrigues et 
al v 
amvac chemical corporation et 
al  andres puerto  et 
al v 
amvac chemical corporation  et 
al and eduardo soriano  et 
al v 
amvac chemical corporation et 
al 
other named defendants are dow chemical company  occidental chemical corporation  shell oil company  standard fruit  dole food  chiquita brands  tela railroad company  compania palma tica  and del monte fresh produce 
these suits were filed in  they were not served until november these complaints were filed in association with the same attorneys who have handled the delgado and carcamo matters listed below 
the complaints allege personal injuries from alleged exposure to dbcp punitive damages are also sought 
the plaintiffs approximately three thousand nine hundred are primarily from the countries of the philippines  costa rica  ecuador and guatemala 
in november  the cases were removed to the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana 
the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the cases back to the state court in december in february  the plaintiffs attorneys withdrew their motion to remand the cases to state court without prejudice  stating that they would wait for an appellate court determination on similar issues in the mississippi and texas cases 
dow chemical company  shell oil company and occidental chemical corporation contend that the vast majority of these plaintiffs were included in the settlement of some fifteen thousand plaintiffs mentioned in the delgado and carcamo matters discussed below 
in september  the plaintiffs attorneys finally evaluated their list of plaintiffs who had settled previously 
they agreed that the plaintiffs who settle with dow chemical company  shell oil company  and occidental chemical corporation were now only proceeding against the grower defendants 
the plaintiffs who had not settle previously would continue with the suit against all defendants  including amvac 
thus  out of the approximately three thousand nine hundred plaintiffs  about three hundred and fourteen are left one hundred and sixty seven are from ecuador  one hundred and two are from costa rica and forty five are from guatemala 
the plaintiffs filed a consolidated third amended complaint in october with soriano as the lead case 
each plaintiff seeks in excess of the minimum jurisdiction of federal court for diversity of citizenship cases seventy five thousand dollars 
amvac has answered the third amended complaint 
with the united states supreme court holding there was no federal court jurisdiction in the patrickson case  the federal court judge issued an order to the parties on april  as to why the cases should not be remanded to state court 
the defendants argued that there was still federal court jurisdiction because of diversity of citizenship  but this diversity did not exist at the time the suites ere originally filed in and accordingly  the court remanded the cases to state court on june  in state court  the three cases were assigned to two different judges 
the defendants considered filing another motion to dismiss based on forum non conveniens 
in louisiana  all defendants must join in making such a motion 
by this time  unfavorable anti forum non conveniens laws had passed or were pending in several of the countries where the plaintiffs resided 
several of the defendants were against consenting to jurisdiction in those countries  which is a condition required by an order of dismissal under forum non conveniens 
as a result  these cases will now be litigated in state court in louisiana 
the state court has not yet scheduled any case management or status conferences 
it is likely that the three cases will be reconsolidated in state court 
as in the other banana worker s cases  no discovery has taken place on the individual claims of the plaintiffs 
thus  it is unknown as to how many of the plaintiffs claim exposure to amvac s product and whether their claims are barred by applicable statutes of limitation 
amvac intends to vigorously contest these cases 
it is too early to provide any evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time 
e 
texas matters these matters involve an earlier round of litigation by foreign banana workers 
the complaints filed in the united states court of appeals  fifth circuit entitled franklin rodriquez delgado  et al  jorge colindres carcamo  individually and on behalf of all other similarly situated  et al  juan ramon valdez  et al  and isae carcamo v 
shell oil company  et al 
the complaints are for personal injuries from alleged exposure to dbcp 
amvac was not sued by the plaintiffs but was sued on a third party complaint by dow chemical company 
these cases were originally filed in various state courts in texas and removed by the defendants to federal court 
by order dated july   the united states district court granted defendants motion to dismiss pursuant to 
table of contents the doctrine of forum non conveniens  requiring the plaintiffs to sue in their native countries 
the court required the defendants to consent to jurisdiction in the foreign countries along with other conditions 
as amvac had not been sued by the plaintiffs directly  it refused to consent to jurisdiction in the foreign countries for these plaintiffs 
in  dow chemical company dismissed its third party complaint against amvac without prejudice 
subsequently  dow chemical company and shell oil company settled with these plaintiffs as well as with about fifteen thousand other banana workers represented by the plaintiffs law firm 
dow chemical company was then dismissed by the plaintiffs with prejudice in september two intervenors who are represented by the same attorneys as the plaintiffs in the patrickson and mississippi cases above have filed a motion in opposition to this dismissal 
the plaintiffs appealed to the fifth circuit on the order of dismissal under forum non conveniens 
in october  the fifth circuit found federal court jurisdiction and affirmed the dismissals based on forum non conveniens 
the united states supreme court refused to accept a hearing at that time 
the plaintiffs want the court to hear this case if it decides to hear the patrickson case 
while amvac is not presently a party in this lawsuit having been dismissed without prejudice  the case is still pending  with the focus now shifted to the grower defendants 
these remaining claims are apparently now being remanded to state courts in texas

nicaragua matters in january  three new cases were filed in nicaragua 
this time defendants besides dow chemical company  shell oil company and dole food were sued  including amvac  occidental chemical corporation  del monte fresh produce  chiquita brands  ameribrom and three chevron entities 
it is reported that these plaintiffs claim damages for sterility and that there are approximately three hundred and fifty plaintiffs named in these three cases 
amvac has not been served to date and has not seen the complaints 
amvac disputes that the nicaraguan courts have jurisdiction over it 
amvac intends to vigorously contest these cases 
it is too early to provide any evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time 
other matters the company may be  from time to time  involved in other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business 
the results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty 
the company has and will continue to expend resources and incur expenses in connection with these proceedings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these proceedings 
while the company continually evaluates insurance levels for product liability  property damage and other potential areas of risk  an adverse determination in one or more of these proceedings could subject the company to significant liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results

identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate elements of property 
the impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss  if any  is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
as of january   the company had an immaterial amount of goodwill and amortization related to the goodwill 
as such  the adoption of sfas  did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
risk factors the company s business may be adversely affected by cyclical and seasonal effects 
the chemical industry in general is cyclical and demands for its products tend to be slightly seasonal 
seasonal usage follows varying agricultural seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
weather patterns can have an impact on the company s operations 
the end user of some of its products may  because of weather patterns  delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting season which may result in a reduction of the use of some products and therefore reduce our revenues and profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will adequately address any adverse seasonal effects 
the industry in which the company does business is extremely competitive and its business may suffer if the company is unable to compete effectively 
generally  the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope  there being more than one way or one product for treatment  eradication  or suppression 
the company faces competition from many domestic and foreign manufacturers  marketers and distributors participating in its marketplace 
competition in the marketplace is based primarily on efficacy  price  safety and ease of application 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources 
the company s ability to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products  and to expand its product lines and customer base 
the company competes principally on the basis of the quality of its products  and the technical service and support given to its customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will compete successfully with existing competitors or with any new competitors 

table of contents if the company is unable to successfully position itself in smaller niche markets  its business may be adversely affected 
the company has attempted to position itself in smaller niche markets that have been or are being abandoned by larger chemical companies 
these types of markets tend not to attract larger chemical companies due to the smaller volume demand 
as a result  larger chemical companies have been divesting themselves of products that fall into such smaller niche markets 
these smaller niche markets require significant and intensive management input and ongoing product research and are near product maturity 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these smaller niche markets or  if it is successful in one or more niche markets  that it will continue to be successful in such niche markets 
the manufacturing of the company s products is subject to governmental regulations 
the company operates two manufacturing facilities one in los angeles  california and the other in axis  alabama the facilities 
the facilities operate under the terms and conditions imposed by required licenses and permits by state and local authorities 
the manufacturing of key ingredients for the company s products occurs at the facilities 
an inability to renew or maintain a license or permit or if the fees for such licenses or permits were increased significantly  wither would impede the company s access to key ingredients and the cost of production would increase  either of which would materially and adversely affect the company s ability to provide its products in a timely and affordable manner 
the distribution and sale of the company s products are subject to prior governmental approvals and thereafter ongoing governmental regulation 
the company s products are subject to laws administered by federal  state and foreign governments  including regulations requiring registration  approval and labeling of its products 
the labeling requirements restrict the use of and type of application for our products 
more stringent restrictions could make our products less desirable which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
substantially all of the company s products are subject to the united states environmental protection agency us epa registration and re registration requirements  and are conditionally registered in accordance with the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra 
such registration requirements are based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of the company s products are used also require registration before they can be marketed or used in that state 
governmental regulatory authorities have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on the company s products 
the company  on its behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  have and are currently furnishing certain required data relative to its products 
under fifra  the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support us registrations 
this requirement has significantly increased the company s operating expenses in such areas as testing and the production of new products 
the company expects such increases to continue in the future 
because scientific analyses are constantly improving  it cannot be determined with certainty whether or not new or additional tests may be required by regulatory authorities 
responding to such requirements may cause delays in the sales of our products which delays would adversely affect our profitability 
while fifra good laboratory practice standards specify the minimum practices and procedures which must be followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity of data related to these tests submitted to the us epa  there can be no assurance the epa will not request certain tests or studies be repeated 
in addition  more stringent legislation or requirements may be imposed in the future 
the company can provide no assurance that any testing approvals or registrations will be granted on a timely basis  if at all  or that its resources will be adequate to meet the costs of regulatory compliance
