in addition to commercial multiple peril policies  crusader also writes separate policies to insure commercial property and commercial liability risks on a mono line basis 
all of crusader s business is produced by unifax insurance systems  inc  unifax its sister corporation 
unifax has substantial experience with these classes of business 
the commissions paid by crusader to unifax are eliminated as intercompany transactions and are not reflected in the previous table 
crusader is licensed in property and casualty and disability lines of insurance by the california department of insurance 
reinsurance a reinsurance transaction occurs when an insurance company transfers cedes a portion of its exposure on business written by it to a reinsurer that assumes that risk for a premium ceded premium 
reinsurance does not legally discharge the company from primary liability under its policies 
if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations  the company must nonetheless pay its policy obligations

m best rating a 
in  crusader had its primary excess of loss reinsurance agreements with general reinsurance corporation 
crusader also has catastrophe reinsurance from various highly rated california admitted and bermuda reinsurance companies 
these reinsurance agreements help protect crusader against liabilities in excess of certain retentions  including major or catastrophic losses that may occur from any one or more of the property and or casualty risks which crusader insures 
the company has no reinsurance recoverable balances in dispute 
the aggregate amount of earned premium ceded to the reinsurers was  for the fiscal year ended december   and  for the fiscal year ended december  on july   crusader increased its retention from  to  per risk 
concurrently  crusader maintained catastrophe and clash covers subject to a maximum occurrence and annual aggregate to help protect the company from one loss occurrence affecting multiple policies 
beginning january   an annual aggregate deductible of  commenced on losses ceded to its reinsurance treaty covering losses between  and  on january   the annual aggregate deductible decreased to  on january   it increased to  and on january   it decreased to  in crusader retained a participation in its excess of loss reinsurance treaties of in its st layer  in excess of  in its nd layer  in excess of  and in its property clash treaty 
prior to january   national reinsurance corporation acquired by general reinsurance corporation in charged a provisional rate on exposures up to  that was subject to adjustment and was based on the amount of losses ceded  limited by a maximum percentage that could be charged 
that provisional rated treaty was cancelled on a runoff basis and replaced by a flat rated treaty on january  on most of the premium that crusader cedes to the reinsurer  the reinsurer pays a commission to crusader that includes a reimbursement of the cost of acquiring the portion of the premium that is ceded 
crusader does not currently assume any reinsurance 
the company intends to continue obtaining reinsurance although the availability and cost may vary from time to time 
the unpaid losses ceded to the reinsurer are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses crusader maintains reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to both reported and unreported losses 
when a claim for loss is reported to the company  a reserve is established for the expected cost to settle the claim  including estimates of any related legal expense and other costs associated with resolving the claim 
these reserves are called case based reserves 
in addition  the company also sets up reserves at the end of each reporting period for losses that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the company 
these incurred but not reported losses are referred to as ibnr reserves 
crusader establishes reserves for reported losses based on historical experience  upon case by case evaluation of facts surrounding each known loss  and the related policy provisions 
the amount of reserves for unreported losses is estimated by analysis of historical and statistical information 
the ultimate liability of crusader may be greater or less than estimated reserves 
reserves are monitored and adjusted when appropriate and are reflected in the statement of operations in the period of adjustment 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimated to cover the future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 
the process of establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves involves significant judgment 
the following table shows the development of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for fiscal years through the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years 
this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses for losses arising in the current and prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date 
the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimate is increased or decreased as more information becomes known 
the table reflects redundancies and deficiencies in crusader s net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
at december   all periods stated in the table reflected a cumulative deficiency 
see discussion of losses and loss adjustment expenses in item management s discussion and analysis results of operations insurance company operation 
crusader is a relatively small insurance company 
crusader is constantly changing its product mix and exposures  including the types of businesses insured within its business package program 
considering the uncertainties from this changing environment  the company recognizes the difficulties in developing its own unique reserving statistics  therefore  it incorporates industry standards and averages into its estimates 
the company believes that its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are properly stated 
when subsequent loss and loss adjustment expense development justifies changes in reserving practices  the company acts accordingly 
when evaluating the information in the following table  it should be noted that each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts of prior periods  therefore  the cumulative redundancy or deficiency represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years 
conditions and trends that have affected development of liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future deficiencies or redundancies based on this table

since each property and casualty insurance company has different capital needs  an acceptable ratio of net premium written to policyholders surplus for one company may be inapplicable to another 
while there is no statutory requirement applicable to crusader that establishes a permissible net premium to surplus ratio  guidelines established by the national association of insurance commissioners naic provide that such ratio should generally be no greater than to twelve months ended december statutory net premiums written      policyholders surplus      ratio to to to to to crusader results are reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
these results differ from its financial results reported in accordance with statutory accounting principles sap as prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities 
crusader is required to file financial statements with insurance regulatory authorities prepared on a sap basis 
sap differs in certain respects from gaap 
the more significant of these differences that apply to crusader are policy acquisition costs such as commissions  premium taxes and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing new and renewal business are capitalized and amortized on a pro rata basis over the period in which the related premiums are earned  rather than expensed as incurred  as required by sap 
certain assets included in balance sheets under gaap are designated as non admitted assets and charged directly against statutory surplus under sap 
non admitted assets include primarily premium receivables that are outstanding over days  federal deferred tax assets in excess of statutory limitations  furniture  equipment  leasehold improvements and prepaid expenses 
amounts related to ceded reinsurance are shown gross as prepaid reinsurance premiums and reinsurance recoverable  rather than netted against unearned premium reserves and loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  respectively  as required by sap 
fixed maturity securities  which are classified as available for sale  are reported at current market values  rather than at amortized cost  or the lower of amortized cost or market  depending on the specific type of security  as required by sap 
the differing treatment of income and expense items results in a corresponding difference in federal income tax expense 
under gaap reporting  changes in deferred income taxes are reflected as an item of income tax benefit or expense 
as required by sap  federal income taxes are recorded when payable and deferred taxes  subject to limitations  are recognized but only to the extent that they do not exceed of statutory surplus 
changes in deferred taxes are recorded directly to statutory surplus 
regulation the insurance company operation is subject to regulation by the california department of insurance the insurance department and by the department of insurance of other states in which crusader is licensed 
the insurance department has broad regulatory  supervisory  and administrative powers 
these powers relate primarily to the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained  the licensing of insurers and their agents  the nature and limitation of insurers investments  the prior approval of rates  rules and forms  the issuance of securities by insurers  periodic financial and market conduct examinations of the affairs of insurers  the annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition and results of operations of such insurers or for other purposes  and the establishment of reserves required to be maintained for unearned premiums  losses  and other purposes 
the regulations and supervision by the insurance department are designed principally for the benefit of policyholders and not for the insurance company shareholders 
the insurance department s market conduct division is responsible for conducting periodic examinations of companies to ensure compliance with california insurance code and california code of regulations with respect to rating  underwriting and claims handling practices 
the most recent examination of crusader covered underwriting and rating practices for the period january   through june  the report on the results of that examination was issued on september  as of december   the company believes that there are no outstanding criticisms arising from that report 
the insurance department also conducts periodic financial examinations of crusader 
the insurance department has completed its financial examination of crusader s december   statutory financial statements 
the report of examination that was filed with the insurance department on may   reported no adjustments to crusader s statutory financial statements 
in december  the naic adopted a risk based capital rbc model law for property and casualty companies 
the rbc model law is intended to provide standards for calculating a variable regulatory capital requirement related to a company s current operations and its risk exposures asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk and off balance sheet risk 
these standards are intended to serve as a diagnostic solvency tool for regulators that establishes uniform capital levels and specific authority levels for regulatory intervention when an insurer falls below minimum capital levels 
the rbc model law specifies four distinct action levels at which a regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over a domestic insurer if its rbc is equal to or less than of its computed authorized control level rbc 
a company s rbc is required to be disclosed in its statutory annual statement 
the rbc is not intended to be used as a rating or ranking tool nor is it to be used in premium rate making or approval 
crusader s adjusted capital at december   was of authorized control level risk based capital 
the following table sets forth the different levels of risk based capital that may trigger regulatory involvement and the corresponding actions that may result 
level trigger corrective action company action level adjusted capital less than the insurer must submit a comprehensive plan to the of authorized control level insurance commissioner regulatory action level adjusted capital less than in addition to above  insurer is subject to examination  of authorized control level analysis and specific corrective action authorized control level adjusted capital less than in addition to both of the above  insurance commissioner of authorized control level may place insurer under regulatory control mandatory control level adjusted capital less than insurer must be placed under regulatory control of authorized control level insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators primarily to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies 
iris helps those companies that merit highest priority in the allocation of the regulators resources on the basis of financial ratios that are calculated annually 
the analytical phase is a review of annual statements and the financial ratios 
the ratios and trends are valuable in pointing to companies likely to experience financial difficulties  but are not themselves indicative of adverse financial condition 
the ratio and benchmark comparisons are mechanically produced and are not intended to replace the state insurance departments own in depth financial analysis or on site examinations 
an unusual range of ratio results has been established from studies of the ratios of companies that have become insolvent or have experienced financial difficulties 
in the analytical phase  companies that receive four or more financial ratio values outside the usual range are analyzed in order to identify those companies that appear to require immediate regulatory action 
subsequently  a more comprehensive review of the ratio results and an insurer s annual statement is performed to confirm that an insurer s situation calls for increased or close regulatory attention 
in  the company was outside the usual values on four of the twelve iris ratio tests 
three of the iris tests ratios that were outside the usual values related to the company s adverse development of its losses and loss adjustment expenses 
these ratios were the two year overall operating ratio  two year reserve development to surplus  and estimated current reserve deficiency to surplus 
one iris ratio test that was outside the usual values was the investment yield ratio 
a usual value for the investment yield ratio is a range greater than and less than 
crusader s statutory investment yield was naic s statutory accounting initiative the naic s project to codify accounting practices was approved by the naic in march the approval included a provision for commissioners discretion in determining appropriate statutory accounting for insurers in their states 
consequently  prescribed and permitted accounting practices may continue to differ from state to state 
codification became effective on january  california insurance guarantee association the california insurance guarantee association ciga was created to provide for payment of claims for which insolvent insurers of most casualty lines are liable but which cannot be paid out of such insurers assets 
the company is subject to assessment by ciga for its pro rata share of such claims based on premiums written in the particular line in the year preceding the assessment by insurers writing that line of insurance in california 
such assessments are based upon estimates of losses to be incurred in liquidating an insolvent insurer 
in a particular year  the company cannot be assessed an amount greater than of its premiums written in the preceding year 
assessments are recouped through a mandated surcharge to policyholders the year after the assessment 
during  the company paid  that was assessed by ciga 
in  due to the growth of premium  the company recovered assessments from policyholders in the amount of  this amount exceeded the assessed amount by  the excess assessments recovered will be remitted to ciga in no assessment was made by ciga for the calendar year 
holding company act crusader is subject to regulation by the insurance department pursuant to the provisions of the california insurance holding company system regulatory act the holding company act 
pursuant to the holding company act  the insurance department may examine the affairs of crusader at any time 
certain transactions defined to be of an extraordinary type may not be effected without the prior approval of the insurance department 
such transactions include  but are not limited to  sales  purchases  exchanges  loans and extensions of credit  and investments made within the immediately preceding months involving the lesser of of admitted assets or of policyholders surplus  as of the preceding december an extraordinary transaction also includes a dividend which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of of the insurance company s policyholders surplus as of the preceding december or the insurance company s net income for the preceding calendar year 
an insurance company is also required to notify the insurance department of any dividend after declaration  but prior to payment 
the holding company act also provides that the acquisition or change of control of a california domiciled insurance company or of any person who controls such an insurance company cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the insurance commissioner 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership of voting securities and securities that are convertible into voting securities  which in the aggregate constitute or more of the voting securities of a california insurance company or a person who controls a california insurance company  such as crusader 
a person seeking to acquire control  directly or indirectly  of the company must generally file with the insurance commissioner an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy of the application to the company 
the holding company act also effectively restricts the company from consummating certain reorganization or mergers without prior regulatory approval 
the company is in compliance with the holding company act 
rating insurance companies are rated to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers with meaningful information on specific insurance companies 
higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a strong ability to pay claims 
these ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors 
such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy  hold or sell any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time 
ratings focus primarily on the following factors capital resources  financial strength  demonstrated management expertise in the insurance business  credit analysis  systems development  market segment position and growth opportunities  marketing  sales conduct practices  investment operations  minimum policyholders surplus requirements and capital sufficiency to meet projected growth  as well as access to such traditional capital as may be necessary to continue to meet standards for capital adequacy 
the claims paying abilities of insurers are rated to provide both insurance consumers and industry participants with comparative information on specific insurance companies 
claims paying ratings are important for the marketing of certain insurance products 
a higher rating generally indicates greater financial strength and a stronger ability to pay claims 
primarily as a result of the underwriting losses in and  the am best company lowered crusader s rating from a excellent to a excellent effective march   based on financial information as of december  at the time the rating was lowered  am best remained concerned with the potential for further adverse loss reserve development and the negative impact it would have on the company s operating performance and overall capitalization and viewed the rating outlook as negative 
due to the continued adverse development in the six months ended june   on october   am best company lowered crusader s rating to b very good 
the lowering of crusader s rating to b did not have a material adverse effect on the company

competition general the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive in the areas of price and service 
it is highly cyclical  characterized by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity 
the profitability of insurers is affected by many factors including rate competition  the frequency of claims and their average cost  natural disasters  state regulations  interest rates  crime rates  general business conditions  and court decisions redefining and expanding the extent of coverage and granting higher compensation awards 
one of the challenging and unique features of the property and casualty business is the fact that  since premiums are collected before losses are paid  its products are normally priced before its costs are known 
insurance company and general agency operations property and casualty the company s property and casualty insurance business continues to experience a competitive marketplace 
there are many substantial competitors who have larger resources  operate in more states  and insure coverages in more lines and in higher limits than the company 
in addition  crusader competes not only with other insurance companies but also with the general agents 
many of these general agents offer more products than the company 
the principal method of competition among competitors is price

revenue and income generation the company receives its revenue primarily from earned premium derived from the insurance company operations  commission and fee income generated from the insurance agency operations  finance charges and fee income from the premium finance operations  and investment income from cash generated primarily from the insurance operation 
the insurance company operation generates approximately of the company s total revenue 
the company s remaining operations constitute a variety of specialty insurance services  each with unique characteristics and individually not material to consolidated revenues 
insurance company operation the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive and includes many insurers  ranging from large companies offering a wide variety of products worldwide to smaller  specialized companies in a single state or region offering only a single product 
many of the company s existing or potential competitors have considerably greater financial and other resources  have a higher rating assigned by independent rating organizations such as am best company  have greater experience in the insurance industry and offer a broader line of insurance products than the company 
currently  crusader is writing primarily commercial multiple peril business only in the state of california and is rated b very good by am best company 
the primary challenge of the property and casualty insurance company operation is the fact that the company sells its products before the ultimate costs are actually known 
when pricing its products  the company projects the ultimate claim and loss adjustment cost that it anticipates will be incurred after the policy is sold 
in addition  factors such as changes in  among other things  regulations  changes in the legal environment  and inflation can all impact the ultimate cost 
over the past two years  the insurance industry has seen some difficult times as a result of september  industry wide underwriting losses  decreases in investment yield  and increases in reinsurance cost that have all contributed to the change from a soft market to a hard market 
the company believes that a hard market cycle currently exists in the insurance marketplace 
the company has experienced beneficial market changes in its primary line of business and is benefiting from the fact that some of its competitors have gone out of business and others have recently raised rates or adopted more restrictive rules 
although the company has increased its rates and adopted more restrictive underwriting guidelines  the beneficial market changes have contributed to a increase in direct written premiums in  a increase in direct written premiums in  and an increase in the number of policies issued in both and the company cannot determine how long the existing market conditions will continue  nor in which direction they might change 
the company s future writings and growth are dependent on  among other things  market conditions  competition  and the company s ability to introduce new and profitable products 
the company believes that rate adequacy is more important than premium growth and underwriting profit is the company s primary goal 
management s assessment of trends and underwriting results is a primary factor in its decisions to expand or contract its business 
primarily as a result of losses from liquor and premise liability coverages  much of the company s business outside of california has not been profitable 
in the company began placing moratoriums on non california business on a state by state basis 
by july  the company had placed moratoriums on all non california business 
the company has no short term plan to expand into additional states or to expand its marketing channels 
instead  the company intends to allocate its resources toward improving its california business rates  rules  and forms 
the company incurred underwriting losses in   and as a result of these underwriting losses  management analyzed and acted upon various components of its underwriting activity 
the company believes that the implementation of these actions have contributed to improved underwriting results 
this is reflected in the decrease in the company s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premium from in  to in  and to in adverse development of prior year losses was substantially lower than and the adverse development was primarily attributable to one claim 
that claim was a loss in excess of policy limits  arising from a policy issued in the claim was resolved on august   for  through binding arbitration 
available reinsurance limits in were  plus pro rata loss adjustment expenses 
as a result of the binding arbitration decision  in crusader incurred adverse development on this claim  net of reinsurance  of approximately  or approximately  net of taxes 
to help ensure that such situations do not reoccur  the company adopted changes in its underwriting and claims adjusting practices  and it bought substantially more reinsurance 
other operations the company s other operations generate commissions  fees  and finance charges from various insurance products 
the events that have the most significant economic impact on other operations are as follows unifax primarily sells and services insurance policies for crusader 
the commissions paid by crusader to unifax are eliminated as intercompany transactions and are not reflected as income in the financial statements 
as a result of the increase in policies sold by unifax and the increase in the service fee from to in august  service fee income increased in compared to aib sells and services health insurance policies for individual family and small business groups primarily for cigna healthcare and receives commission and fee income based on the premiums that it writes 
commission and fee income in this program increased in the year ended december   compared to  as a result of increased premiums written in this program 
however cigna healthcare is discontinuing its individual family health insurance program over the period from november  through october  aib has been assisting existing cigna policyholders to find health coverage with other insurance carriers that aib represents 
the company is unsure of the number of terminated cigna policyholders it may ultimately assist with the purchase of new health coverage 
in addition  cigna small business group has decreased due to intense competition in both rates and benefits offered 
aac which finances crusader policies  benefited from crusader s increase in average policy premiums and resulted in its average loan amount increasing in compared to investments and liquidity the company generates revenue from its investment portfolio  which consisted of approximately million at amortized cost at december   compared to million at amortized cost at december  although the portfolio increased in  investment income decreased approximately  the decrease in investment income is primarily the result of a decline in short and long term yields in the marketplace and a shorter weighted average maturity of the portfolio 
due to the interest rate environment  management believed it was prudent to purchase fixed maturity investments with shorter maturities with minimal credit risk 
primarily as a result of the company s growth in premiums in and  the company generated positive cash flows from operations  which was approximately million in and million in the increased cash flows from operations contributed to the increase in the company s investment portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of the company s business insurance and insurance services and whereas company growth does not normally require material reinvestments of profits into property or equipment  the cash flow generated from operations usually results in improved liquidity for the company 
because the company is a holding company and operates through its subsidiaries  its cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distributions of those earnings to the company 
the cash flow provided by operations in the year ended december   was  an increase in cash flow of  compared to the cash flow for the year ending december  the increase in cash flow from operations in was primarily the result of crusader s growth in written premiums unearned premium reserves increased 
cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was  an increase of  in cash provided compared to the year ended december  the most significant liquidity risk faced by the company would be continued adverse development of the insurance company claims  both reported and unreported 
the company has taken measures to address the underlying causes of the adverse development  however  no assurance can be given that the measures taken will be successful or that the company s estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses will be sufficient 
based on the company s current loss and loss expense reserves and expected current and future payments  the company believes that there are no current liquidity issues 
crusader generates a significant amount of cash as a result of its holdings of unearned premium reserves  its reserves for loss payments  and its capital and surplus 
crusader s loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirement of the company 
these payments are continually monitored and projected to ensure that the company has the liquidity to cover these payments without the need to liquidate its investments

as a california insurance company  crusader is obligated to pay a premium tax on gross premiums written in all states that crusader is admitted 
premium taxes are deferred and amortized as the related premiums are earned 
the premium tax is in lieu of state franchise taxes and is not included in the provision for state taxes 
a recent court ruling in ceridian vs 
franchise tax board held that the california statute permitting the tax deductibility of dividends received from a wholly owned insurance subsidiary was unconstitutional because it discriminated against out of state holding companies and thus was in violation of the interstate commerce clause of the united states constitution 
the ruling concluded that the discriminatory sections of the statute are not severable and the entire statute is invalid and unenforceable 
california law provides that the proper remedy in such circumstances is to disallow the deduction to those taxpayers that benefited from the deduction 
as a result of the court ruling  in february  the franchise tax board ftb notified the company that it would issue a notice of proposed assessment npa for the tax years and of approximately  representing california state franchise taxes plus related interest of approximately  the company is following the progress of current legislation that would address the unconstitutionality of the california statue by restructuring the rate at which california taxes dividends for in and out of state insurance holding companies 
the legislation would also resolve the issue regarding the retroactive assessments due to the disallowance of the deduction 
if the legislation were enacted  it would result in the company paying a relatively small amount of california franchise taxes on dividends received from its insurance company subsidiary 
without a legislative solution  the company anticipates the ultimate outcome of the dividend received deduction will be settled by future litigation 
the company intends to pay the npa to stop the interest from accruing and to file a protective claim for refund to preserve its rights if legislation or litigation resolves the issue 
the full amount of the npa has been accrued in the financial statement as of december  after the federal tax benefit of deducting the state taxes and interest related to the npa  the effect on net income in the quarter ended december   is approximately  an unsatisfactory conclusion to the inter company dividend issue could affect unico s future dividend policy to its shareholders 
the company has certain obligations to make future payments under contracts and credit related financial instruments and commitments 
at december   certain long term aggregate contractual obligations and credit related commitments are summarized as follows within after contractual obligations total year years years years building lease     notes payable related parties   total     results of operations general the company had a net income of  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december   and net loss of  for the year ended december  total revenue for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december for the year ended december   the company had income before taxes of  compared to a loss before taxes of  in the year ended december   an increase in income before taxes of  the increase in pre tax income was primarily due to a decrease of  in the underwriting loss net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs from crusader 
the company had a net earnings for the year ended december   of  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december   an increase in net earnings of for the year ended december   the company had a loss before taxes of  compared to a loss before taxes of  in the year ended december   a decrease in loss before taxes of  the decrease in pre tax loss was primarily due to a decrease of  in the underwriting loss net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs from crusader 
the company had a net loss for the year ended december   of  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december   a decrease in net loss of the effect of inflation on the net income of the company during the years ended december    and was not significant 
the company derives revenue from various sources as discussed below 
insurance company operation premium and loss information of crusader are as follows year ended december gross written premium    net written premium net of reinsurance ceded    earned premium before reinsurance ceded    earned premium net of reinsurance ceded    losses and loss adjustment expenses    unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses    crusader s primary line of business is commercial multiple peril business package policies 
this line of business represented approximately of crusader s total written premium for the years ended december  and  and for the year ended december  as of december   crusader was licensed as an admitted insurance company in the states of arizona  california  colorado  idaho  montana  nevada  ohio  oregon  and washington and is approved as a non admitted surplus lines writer in other states 
crusader s gross written premium by state is as follows year ended december california    arizona    idaho    kentucky  montana    nevada    ohio    oregon    pennsylvania    texas   washington    total gross written premium    for the year ended december   gross written premium increased by  compared to the year ended december  the above mentioned growth in written premium was due to an increase in written premium in the state of california 
the increase in written premium in the state of california in was primarily the result of the continued subsidence in priced based competition in the property casualty insurance market that has resulted in the company s products becoming more competitive 
in addition  the company has increased rates on some of its california products  is in the process of filing for rate increases on some of its california products  and is waiting for regulatory approval of rate increases on some of its products that have already been filed with california regulatory authorities 
the company believes that a hard market cycle exists in california 
industry wide underwriting losses  decreases in investment yield  and increases in reinsurance cost have all contributed to the change from the soft market to the hard market 
the company is also benefiting from the fact that some of its competitors have gone out of business and others have recently raised rates or adopted more restrictive rules 
the company cannot determine how long the existing market conditions will continue  nor in which direction they might change 
the company s future writings and growth are dependent on market conditions  competition  and the company s ability to introduce new and profitable products 
premiums written outside of california in decreased  
primarily as a result of losses from liquor and premise liability coverages  much of the company s business outside of california has not been profitable 
in the company began placing moratoriums on non california business on a state by state basis 
by july  the company had placed moratoriums on all non california business 
as a result of these moratoriums  written premium outside california decreased significantly to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  there were no premiums written outside the state of california in the quarter ended december  the company has no short term plan to expand into additional states  or to expand its marketing channels 
instead  the company intends to allocate its resources toward improving its california business rates  rules  and forms 
the company s average premium per policy issued is as follows year ended direct written policies average december premium issued premium as discussed above  the fact that some of the company s competitors have gone out of business and others have recently raised rates or adopted more restrictive rules resulted in a increase in the number of policies issued by the company in as compared to the number of policies issued in increased over the company continues to believe that it can compete effectively and profitably by offering better service and by marketing its policies through its current independent agents and brokers 
the company writes annual policies and  therefore  earns written premium daily over the one year policy term 
premium earned before reinsurance increased  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and increased  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in earned premium before reinsurance in and was directly related to the increase in written premium in and earned ceded premiums increased in and primarily as a result of rate increases by the company s reinsurers effective january   and on january   and the related increase in direct earned premium on which these rates are based 
the rate increases are primarily due to the company s ceded loss experience and the hardening of the reinsurance marketplace 
ceding commissions increased in from to 
ceding commission is a component of policy acquisition costs 
the annual aggregate deductible on crusader s primary excess of loss treaty was  in   in  and  in in crusader retained a participation in its excess of loss reinsurance treaties of in its st layer  in excess of  in its nd layer  in excess of  and in its property clash treaty 
premium ceded under the provisionally rated contract  which was canceled on a runoff basis effective december   is subject to adjustment based on the amount of losses ceded  limited by a maximum percentage that can be charged by the reinsurer 
crusader s st layer primary excess of loss treaty provides for a contingent commission equal to of the net profit  if any  accruing to the reinsurer 
the first accounting period for the contingent commission covers the combined accident years through  and therefore no contingent commission has been accrued 
crusader s direct earned premium  earned ceded premium  and ceding commission are as follows year ended december direct earned premium    earned ceded premium excluding provisionally rated ceded premium    provisionally rated ceded premium    total earned ceded premium    ceding commission    earned ceded premium  net of ceding commission    ratios to direct earned premium direct ceded premium earned ceded premium  net of ceding commission the combined ratio is the sum of the net ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred including a provision for incurred but not reported losses ibnr to net premiums earned loss ratio and the ratio of policy acquisition costs to net premiums earned expense ratio 
the following table shows the loss ratios  expense ratios  and combined ratios of crusader as derived from data prepared in accordance with gaap 
as shown on the table below  the loss ratio decreased to in from in and decreased from in this decrease in the loss ratio since was primarily due to a decrease in prior years incurred losses 
generally  if the combined ratio is below  an insurance company has an underwriting profit  if it is above  a company has an underwriting loss 
year ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses before reinsurance were  at december   compared to  at december   and to  at december  the increase in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in is primarily a result of increased ibnr reserves as a result of the increase in earned premium in the year ended december  as discussed above 
the increase in reserves at december  and reflects both an increase in claim severities and adverse development of prior years in the company s commercial multiple peril cmp and other liability lines of business 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses before reinsurance for each of crusader s lines of business were as follows year ended december line of business cmp    other liability    other    total    the company s consolidated financial statements include estimated reserves for unpaid losses and related claim settlement or loss adjustment expenses of our insurance company operation 
crusader sets loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at each balance sheet date at management s best estimate of the ultimate payments that it anticipates will be made to settle all losses incurred and related expenses incurred as of that date for both reported and unreported losses 
the process of estimating loss and loss adjustment reserves involves significant judgment and is complex and imprecise due to the number of variables and assumptions inherent in the estimating process 
crusader establishes reserves for reported losses based on historical experience  upon case by case evaluation of facts surrounding each known loss  and the related policy provisions 
the amount of reserves for unreported losses is estimated by analysis of historical and statistical information 
reserves are monitored and adjusted when appropriate and reflected in the statement of operations in the period of adjustment 
losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses were  of net premium earned for the year ended december   compared to  of net premium earned for the year ended december  the decrease in losses for the year ended december   is primarily the result of a decrease in the adverse development of prior year losses in compared to the adverse loss development in was  compared to  in the adverse development in was primarily attributable to one claim 
that claim was a loss in excess of policy limits  arising from a policy issued in the claim was resolved on august   for million through binding arbitration 
available reinsurance limits in were  plus pro rata loss adjustment expenses 
as a result of the binding arbitration decision  in crusader incurred adverse development on this claim  net of reinsurance  of approximately  or approximately  net of taxes 
to help assure that such situations do not reoccur  the company adopted changes in its underwriting and claims adjusting practices  and it bought substantially more reinsurance 
the remaining adverse development in was attributable to continued losses due to the impact of changes in california case law that expanded coverage and increased loss exposure primarily on construction defect claims for claims occurring on or prior to the company s revision of its policy forms in losses and loss adjustment expenses the adverse development in the year ending december   of  was primarily the result of liquor and premises liability outside of california for the accident years through and higher than anticipated costs of construction defect and apartment house habitability claims for accident years prior to the liquor liability claims arose from the liability of tavern owners related to the sale of alcoholic beverages 
based on the development in of the liquor and premises liability claims the company increased its estimate of ultimate losses for and subsequent years 
adverse favorable development of prior years losses in by line of business is as follows accident years ended december line of business and prior total cmp      other liability      other      total      losses and loss adjustment expenses were  of net premium earned for the year ended december   compared to  of net premium earned for the year ended december  the decrease in losses for the year ended december   is primarily the result of a decrease in the adverse development of prior year losses in compared to the adverse loss development in was  compared to  in the adverse development in the year ending december   of  was primarily the result of liquor and premises liability outside of california for the accident years through  and the result of higher than anticipated costs of construction defect and apartment house habitability claims for accident years prior to the liquor liability claims arise from the liability of tavern owners related to the sale of alcoholic beverages 
based on the development in of the liquor and premises liability claims the company increased its estimate of ultimate losses for and subsequent 
in the year ended december   the company increased its estimates of ultimate losses for both reported and unreported claims primarily occurring from through and from through the years most impacted by construction defect claims 
adverse development of prior years losses of  as of december   was primarily the result of an increase in the company s estimate of ultimate reported and unreported claims for construction defect claims  non california liquor liability claims and apartment house habitational type of claims 
the company believed that it had adequately addressed its estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses as of december   and anticipated that underwriting changes in problematic business such as reducing coverages  modifying policy forms  more restrictive underwriting  reductions in non california business  and increasing rates would be reflected in the development 
however  continued adverse development in indicated that the underwriting changes implemented through december   were not sufficient to fully address the losses primarily occurring on accident years through on the company s business outside of california primarily liquor and premises liability  and on the company s special risk class of business 
liquor liability claims arise from the liability of tavern owners related to the sale of alcoholic beverages 
the company s special risk class of business represents risks written within current underwriting programs that have a higher degree of exposure and require special pricing and underwriting 
based on the development in primarily on the business discussed above  the company increased its estimate of ultimate losses for accident years and subsequent 
the adverse development in for accident years and prior was primarily due to higher than anticipated cost of construction defect and apartment house habitability claims 
construction defect claims arise from the liability of contractors for their defective work in the construction of habitation structures such as apartments  condominiums and single family dwellings or commercial type structures 
apartment house habitability claims arise from uninhabitable conditions related to dilapidated structures and insect and vermin infestation 
in light of the adverse development in  the company increased the frequency and scope of its reserve studies 
the continued adverse development in  discussed above  was first observed in june when the company determined that losses for accident years and were developing higher than anticipated and the underwriting actions had not mitigated loss exposure to the extent previously estimated 
of the total adverse development in of   was reflected as of june  adverse development of prior years losses in represented of net reserves as of december  the following table provides an analysis of the roll forward of crusader s losses and loss adjustment expenses  including a reconciliation of the ending balance sheet liability for the periods indicated year ended december reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at beginning of year net of reinsurance    incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses provision for insured events of current year    increase in provision for events of prior years    total losses and loss adjustment expenses    payments losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of the current year    losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of prior years    total payments    reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year net of reinsurance    reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year    reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year per balance sheet  gross of reinsurance    in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts  reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are reported for gaap as assets rather than netted against the corresponding liability for such items on the balance sheet 
estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is needed 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials and labor rates can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon the accumulation of individual case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting period plus estimates based on experience and industry data for development of case estimates and for unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses 
since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties  the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims  both reported and unreported 
crusader incurred underwriting losses in   and as a result of these underwriting losses  crusader s management analyzed and acted upon the following components of its underwriting activity business outside of california habitability exposure construction defect exposure special risk class of business increased cost of settling claims  indemnity and expense increased cost of reinsurance mold exposure terrorism exposure market conditions and competition the following is a discussion of the above items 
crusader believes that except for one aberrational claim previously discussed under the adverse development  the implementation of the above items have contributed to improved operating results 
business outside of california as reflected on the table below  collectively  the insurance underwritten by the company outside of california has been very unprofitable  particularly with respect to the liquor and premises types of liability coverage 
the company adopted substantial rate increases and coverage restrictions beginning in june of for all liquor liability written outside of california and nevada 
the rate increases caused a dramatic decline in sales  causing the company to be concerned about adverse selection 
the company determined that under current market conditions  it could not sell its policies at an adequate rate outside of california and ceased writing in those states 
direct written premium outside california decreased from  in  to  in  to  in non california non california accident direct written direct earned year premium premium habitability exposure in and  the company began experiencing adverse development on its apartment house business  due primarily to the effect of settlements on habitability claims 
those settlements were substantially influenced by a statute that provides for the payment of plaintiff attorney fees without regard to policy limits  and by the montrose chemical corp 
v 
admiral insurance company decision of starting in october  the company significantly changed its underwriting practice with respect to the type of apartment buildings thought to cause these claims 
these changes included a 
in september  the company identified a subcategory of apartment building risk  referred to as the big and old group 
the company believes that members of this group pose a greater than average probability of habitability loss 
b 
on september   the company imposed more stringent underwriting restrictions and requirements upon members of the big and old group  including the adoption of more restrictive coverage forms and use of maintenance warranties for members of this group 
c 
on september   the company changed its coverage forms to limit the costs taxed against the insured clause of the supplementary provisions coverage grant  from unlimited to d 
in september  the company adopted an liability rate increase for all of its apartment risks 
since  no additional claims of any significance have been reported to crusader 
the company believes that the combination of improved underwriting and policy language limiting supplemental payments have substantially reduced the exposure 
construction defect exposure the company continuously modifies its underwriting practice with respect to subcontractors in an effort to improve loss experience 
for example  subcontractors performing waterproofing  weather coating  or decking were deemed ineligible by the company in  and  to minimize the adverse effects of the montrose decision of  the company changed its coverage forms in  and  the company adopted numerous  program specific questions to its applications  inspections  and survey forms 
although the company believes that the ultimate results of its post underwriting of this class of business will prove to be profitable  the results will not be known until the year statute runs 
therefore  on april   the company sought regulatory approval for a change in or discontinuation of its experience rating plan 
when the regulator disapproved that filing  on june   the company imposed a moratorium on all new offers of artisan contractors insurance 
in january crusader received regulatory approval of its plan to discontinue experience rating  which translates into a rate increase for all coverages offered to artisan contractors 
however  because the company is cautious about underwriting this type of business  it has not lifted the underwriting moratorium that started on june  since that date  attrition was significant  reducing the number of policies in force 
until such time that the company can change this program to make underwriting more predictable  the moratorium will not be lifted 
the special risks division the company s special risk class of business represents risks written within current underwriting programs that have a higher degree of exposure and require special pricing and underwriting 
in november after a change of program management  the company reviewed those policies underwritten by its special risks division 
that review resulted in the cancellation of a significant number of policies  those thought to be generating most of the losses 
special risk special risk special risk direct written direct earned policies year premium premium in force   as of   as of   as of   as of   as of   as of increased cost of settling claims in the company noticed a trend of increasing costs but does not believe that the trend reflects operational changes 
the company believes that the trend is most likely attributable to several changes in the law  including an increased propensity for trial courts to award large plaintiff verdicts 
however  several favorable decisions were recently published  including the federal supreme court s limitation on punitive damages see campbell vs 
state farm   and the california supreme court s limitation on public policy reformations see rosen vs 
state farm  
it is difficult to quantify and predict the continuation of this trend 
in  an outside actuary was engaged to assist the company in reviewing the premium rate adequacy of certain key crusader programs and to assist in the regulatory rate filings 
crusader raises its premium rates whenever the adequacy is in doubt 
increased cost of reinsurance in  the cost of reinsurance significantly increased primarily as a result of losses sustained outside of california that the company no longer underwrites 
the company received a slight decrease in its reinsurance rates in mold exposure the company has not seen any significant mold based claim and all of its policies are now being endorsed with a mold exclusion 
in addition  numerous articles from respected medical authorities were recently published  making plaintiffs task of proving mold based injuries much more difficult 
terrorism exposure all policies are endorsed with a terrorism endorsement that conforms with the federal terrorism risk insurance act of november  all policyholders that reject the federal coverage will get a policy containing a terrorism exclusion endorsement 
market conditions  competition the company continues to benefit from the hard market conditions 
although some new competitors have entered the marketplace  their pricing seems to be reasonable and therefore the company s products continue to remain competitive 
primarily as a result of the underwriting losses in and  the am best company lowered crusader s rating from a excellent to a excellent effective march   based on financial information as of december  at the time the rating was lowered  am best remained concerned with the potential for further adverse loss reserve development and the negative impact it would have on the company s operating performance and overall capitalization and viewed the rating outlook as negative 
due to the continued adverse development in the six months ended june   on october   am best company lowered crusader s rating to b very good and continues to view its rating outlook as negative 
the lowering of crusader s rating to b did not have a material adverse effect on the company 
other insurance operations health and life insurance program commission income from the health and life insurance sales of nib and aib is as follows year ended december commission income    aib markets health and life insurance in california through non affiliated insurance companies for individuals and groups 
in january  nib assigned all its contracts and commissions to aib  and nib is now inactive 
in and approximately and of the health and life commission income accordingly was from the cigna healthcare medical and dental plan programs 
revenues for the year ended december   increased  compared to the year ended december  the increase in health and life insurance program commission and fee income is primarily due to an increase in premium written 
this increase in health and life insurance income is primarily due to both increased marketing efforts and the fact that in november cigna terminated their contract with another administrator and approximately  affected members were transitioned into the company s health and life insurance program effective january  approximately were enrolled in the cigna individual health and family program and were enrolled in cigna s small group program 
beginning in april  cigna discontinued its individual and family health insurance program to new policyholders in the state of california

as of december   approximately  policyholders have terminated their cigna policies 
of this amount  the company has placed approximately policyholders with other carriers 
the company cannot determine the percentage of affected policyholders that will leave through normal attrition or that will not be accepted by the company s other insurance carriers due to pre existing health conditions 
the discontinuance of cigna s individual and family health insurance program does not affect the cigna small group program 
due to intense competition in both rates and benefits offered  cigna small group program membership decreased in as of december   cigna small group program membership is comprised of  subscribers and  dependents compared to  subscribers and  dependents as of december  revenues for the year ended december   increased  compared to the year ended december  the increase in commission income in the health and life insurance programs is primarily due to an increase in premiums written in the cigna healthcare programs

as of december   the non affiliated insurer assumed the claim administration for the remaining outstanding and ibnr claims 
the company will no longer receive any claim administration fees and will not incur any future internal claim administration costs

revenue increased  in the year ended december   compared to the prior year although there were fewer loans financed in the current year 
the increase in revenue in is primarily due to an increase of approximately in the amount of average loan financed 
although aac financed approximately of all unifax policies financed compared to in the prior year  the percentage of all unifax policies that are financed decreased from approximately in to approximately in revenue for the year ended december   increased  compared to the year ended december  the number of new loans decreased by in the year ending december   compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenues despite the decrease in the number of new loans in is primarily due to the fact that the average policy loan being financed is approximately greater than the prior year

operating expenses policy acquisition costs consist of commissions  premium taxes  inspection fees  and certain other underwriting costs that are directly related to and vary with the production of crusader insurance policies 
these costs include both crusader expenses and allocated expenses of other unico subsidiaries 
on certain reinsurance treaties  crusader receives a ceding commission from its reinsurer that represents a reimbursement of the acquisition costs related to the premium ceded 
no ceding commission is received on provisionally rated ceded premium 
policy acquisition costs  net of ceding commission  are deferred and amortized as the related premiums are earned 
the ratio of policy acquisition cost to net earned premium in was lower than the ratio in and primarily due to the increase in the company s ceding commission from its reinsurer as of january  from in to in policy acquisition costs  net of ceding commission  are as follows year ended december policy acquisition costs    ratio to net earned premium gaap ratio salaries and employee benefits increased  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  factors that affected the increase include the hiring of higher level employees  general salary increases less than  increases in employee benefits costs  and the composition of employees whose salaries and employee benefits are capitalized to policy acquisition cost versus those being directly expensed

this is true for both increases and decreases in production 
operating expenses decreased  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease is primarily the result of the settlement of litigation with the company s former stock transfer agent that resulted in the receipt of  to reimburse damages and legal expenses that were incurred from through year ended december other operating expenses    income taxes the income tax expense for the year ended december   was  compared to an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  the effective combined income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the pre tax income increased  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   which resulted in an increased income tax expense in also contributing to the income tax expense in was the recognition of an assessment of  for the years and from the california franchise tax board 
a recent court ruling in ceridian vs 
franchise tax board held that the california statute permitting the tax deductibility of dividends received from a wholly owned insurance subsidiary was unconstitutional because it discriminated against out of state holding companies and thus was in violation of the interstate commerce clause of the united states constitution 
the ruling concluded that the discriminatory sections of the statute are not severable and the entire statute is invalid and unenforceable 
california law provides that the proper remedy in such circumstances is to disallow the deduction to those taxpayers that benefited from the deduction 
as a result of the court ruling  in february  the franchise tax board ftb notified the company that it would issue a notice of proposed assessment npa for tax years and of approximately  representing california state franchise taxes plus related interest of approximately  the income tax benefit for the year ended december   was  compared to an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  the effective combined income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the pre tax loss was significantly lower in compared to  which resulted in the difference in the effective tax rates between and the income tax benefit for and arises primarily from the company s ability to recover prior income taxes paid due to the carryback of those years net operating losses see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while every effort is made to ensure the integrity of such estimates  actual results could differ 
management believes the company s current critical accounting policies comprise the following losses and loss adjustment expenses the preparation of the company s financial statements requires judgments and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves as required by statement of financial accounting standards no sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is needed 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials and labor rates can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon the accumulation of individual case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting period plus estimates based on experience and industry data for development of case estimates and for unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses 
since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties  the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims  both reported and unreported 
investments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company is required to classify its investments in debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
although all of the company s investments are classified as available for sale and although the company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to economic and market conditions  its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality investments to maturity 
short term investments are carried at cost  which approximates market value 
investments in equity securities are carried at market value 
the unrealized gains or losses from fixed maturities and equity securities are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a separate component of stockholders equity  net of any deferred tax effect 
when a decline in value of a fixed maturity or equity security is considered other than temporary  a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
realized gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations based on the specific identification method

these statements  which may be identified by forward looking words or phrases such as anticipate  appears  believe  estimates  expect  intend  may  should  and would  involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond the control of the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of invested assets whose fair values are subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the company s invested assets at december  and consisted of the following fixed maturity bonds at amortized cost   short term cash investments at cost   certificates of deposit over year at cost   total invested assets   the company s interest rate risk is primarily in its fixed maturity bond portfolio 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio increases with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
in addition  the longer the maturity  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company limits this risk by investing in securities with maturities no greater than eight years 
in addition  although fixed maturity bonds are classified as available for sale  the company s investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality bonds to maturity 
because fixed maturity bonds are primarily held to maturity  the change in the market value of these bonds resulting from interest rate movements is unrealized and no gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
unrealized gains and losses are reported as separate components of stockholders equity  net of any deferred tax effect 
as of december   the company s unrealized gains net of unrealized losses before income taxes on its fixed maturity bond portfolio were  compared to  as of december  given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the fixed maturity bond portfolio as of december   would decrease by approximately million 
this decrease would not be reflected in the statements of operations except to the extent that the securities were sold 
the company s short term investments and certificates of deposit have only minimal interest rate risk
