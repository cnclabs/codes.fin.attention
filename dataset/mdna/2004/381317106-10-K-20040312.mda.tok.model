competition and other matters the company experiences strong competition in both attracting deposits and making real estate loans 
competition for savings deposits has historically come from other savings institutions  commercial banks  credit unions  the equities market  mutual funds  issuers of government and corporate debt securities  securities dealers  insurance companies  and other financial services providers 
the principal methods used by the company to attract deposits  in addition to the interest rates and terms offered  include the offering of a variety of free financial services  the convenience of over office locations  and easy access to wsb s products and services over the internet at www 
worldsavings 
com 
competition in making real estate loans comes principally from other savings institutions  mortgage banking companies  and commercial banks 
many of the nation s largest savings institutions  mortgage banking companies  and commercial banks are headquartered or have a significant number of branch offices in the areas in which the company competes 
the primary factors in competing for real estate loans are interest rates  loan fee charges  underwriting standards  and the quality of service to borrowers and their representatives 
in addition  the company competes indirectly with government sponsored enterprises  notably fannie mae and freddie mac 
changes in the government s monetary  tax  or housing financing policies can also affect the ability of lenders to compete profitably 
thrift industry the operations of the thrift industry are significantly influenced by general economic conditions  by the related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and by the policies of financial institution regulatory authorities 
deposit flows and costs of funds are impacted by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending and other investment activities are affected by the demand for mortgage financing and for consumer and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting the supply of housing and the availability of funds 
regulation office of thrift supervision 
because they are federally chartered savings institutions  both wsb and wtx are regulated principally by the ots 
under various regulations of the ots  savings institutions are required  among other things  to pay assessments to the ots  maintain required regulatory capital  maintain a satisfactory level of liquid assets  and comply with various limitations on loans to one borrower  equity investments  investments in real estate  and investments in corporate debt securities that are not investment grade 
in addition  savings institutions must comply with ots regulations governing deposits and mortgage loans including regulations concerning the indexes and interest rate adjustments of the company s arms products 
federal deposit insurance corporation 
the fdic administers two separate deposit insurance funds  the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif 
each fund insures deposit accounts up to the maximum amount permitted by law  currently  per insured depositor 
initially  the bif was a deposit insurance fund for commercial banks  federally chartered savings banks  and some state chartered savings banks  and the saif was a deposit insurance fund for most other savings associations 
through the years  there has developed considerable overlap between the funds 
wsb is a member of the bif  but a portion of wsb s deposits are insured through the saif 
at december   of wsb s deposits were saif insured 
wtx s deposits are also insured by the fdic and wtx is a member of the bif 
fdic insurance is required for all federally chartered financial institutions such as wsb and wtx 
fdic insurance may be terminated by the fdic under certain circumstances involving violations of regulations or unsound practices 
during  federal legislation was enacted to capitalize the saif in order to bring it into parity with the bif 
the new law required members to pay a levy of billion to bring the saif up to the required reserve level of of insured deposits  but lowered thrift deposit insurance premiums for saif members starting in as a result of this legislation  the company incurred a one time charge of million during the premiums paid for the years through were adjusted quarterly and premiums paid starting were adjusted semi annually 
as of december   the premium paid by wsb and wtx to the fdic was an annual rate of 
per  of deposits 
federal reserve board 
federal reserve board regulations require financial institutions to maintain noninterest earning reserves against their checking accounts 
the balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the federal reserve board may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements 
wsb and wtx are currently in compliance with all applicable federal reserve board reserve requirements 
savings institutions have authority to borrow from the federal reserve bank 
regulatory capital 
the financial institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of firrea established capital standards for federally insured financial institutions  such as wsb and wtx 
under firrea  savings institutions must have tangible capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  have core capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  and have risk based capital equal to at least of risk weighted assets 
the ots and other bank regulatory agencies have established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the rules provide that a savings institution is well capitalized if its leverage ratio is or greater  its tier risk based capital ratio is or greater  its total risk based capital ratio is or greater and the institution is not subject to a capital directive 
as used herein  the total risk based capital ratio is the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets  the tier risk based capital ratio is the ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets  and the tier or leverage ratio is the ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets  in each case as calculated in accordance with current ots capital regulations 
as of december   the most recent notification from the ots categorized wsb and wtx as well capitalized under the current requirements 
there are no conditions or events that have occurred since that notification that the company believes would have an impact on the categorization of wsb or wtx 
at december  and  wsb and wtx had the following regulatory capital calculated in accordance with firrea s capital standards table regulatory capital ratios  minimum capital requirements  and well capitalized capital requirements as of december  dollars in thousands well capitalized minimum capital capital actual requirements requirements capital ratio capital ratio capital ratio wsb and subsidiaries tangible   tier core or leverage    tier risk based   total risk based    wtx tangible   tier core or leverage    tier risk based   total risk based    table regulatory capital ratios  minimum capital requirements  and well capitalized capital requirements as of december  dollars in thousands well capitalized minimum capital capital actual requirements requirements capital ratio capital ratio capital ratio wsb and subsidiaries tangible   tier core or leverage    tier risk based   total risk based    wtx tangible   tier core or leverage    tier risk based   total risk based    the table below shows a reconciliation of wsb s equity capital to regulatory capital at december  table world savings bank  fsb and subsidiaries reconciliation of equity capital to regulatory capital as of december  dollars in thousands core tier total equity tangible tangible leverage risk based risk based capital capital equity capital capital capital common stock paid in surplus  retained earnings  unrealized gain on securities after tax  equity capital       non includable subsidiary      unrealized gain on securities after tax      non qualifying cmsrs      general allowance for loan losses  regulatory capital      total assets  adjusted total assets    risk weighted assets   capital ratio actual regulatory capital ratio requirements well capitalized  equal to or greater than the table below shows a reconciliation of wsb s equity capital to regulatory capital at december  table world savings bank  fsb and subsidiaries reconciliation of equity capital to regulatory capital as of december  dollars in thousands core tier total equity tangible tangible leverage risk based risk based capital capital equity capital capital capital common stock paid in surplus  retained earnings  unrealized gain on securities after tax  equity capital       non includable subsidiary      unrealized gain on securities after tax      non qualifying cmsrs      general allowance for loan losses  regulatory capital      total assets  adjusted total assets    risk weighted assets   capital ratio actual regulatory capital ratio requirements well capitalized  equal to or greater than the table below shows a reconciliation of wtx s equity capital to regulatory capital at december  table world savings bank  fsb texas reconciliation of equity capital to regulatory capital as of december  dollars in thousands core tier total equity tangible tangible leverage risk based risk based capital capital equity capital capital capital common stock paid in surplus  retained earnings  equity capital       general allowance for loan losses regulatory capital      total assets  adjusted total assets    risk weighted assets   capital ratio actual regulatory capital ratio requirements well capitalized  equal to or greater than the table below shows a reconciliation of wtx s equity capital to regulatory capital at december  table world savings bank  fsb texas reconciliation of equity capital to regulatory capital as of december  dollars in thousands core tier total equity tangible tangible leverage risk based risk based capital capital equity capital capital capital common stock paid in surplus  retained earnings  equity capital       general allowance for loan losses regulatory capital      total assets  adjusted total assets    risk weighted assets   capital ratio actual regulatory capital ratio requirements well capitalized  equal to or greater than federal home loan bank system 
the fhlb system provides credit to its members  which include savings institutions  commercial banks  insurance companies  credit unions  and certain other entities 
each fhlb has joint and several liability for the obligations of the eleven other fhlbs in the system 
wsb is a member of the fhlb of san francisco and wtx is a member of the fhlb of dallas 
as members  wsb and wtx may obtain advances borrowings from  and must own capital stock of  their respective fhlb 
advances are secured by collateral pledges and a blanket lien on the assets of the institution 
in the event a member bank  such as wsb or wtx  defaults on an advance  the federal home loan bank act establishes priority of the fhlb s claim over various other claims 
wsb and wtx must own an amount of capital stock that depends generally upon their outstanding fhlb advances 
in the event a fhlb falls below its minimum capital requirements  the fhlb may require its members to purchase additional capital stock of the fhlb 
capital distributions by savings institutions 
see item  market for registrant s common stock and related stockholder matters on page  for a discussion on certain limitations imposed by the ots on dividends paid by savings institutions 
during  wsb paid million in upstream dividends to golden west 
limitation on loans to one borrower 
current law subjects savings institutions to the same loans to one borrower restrictions that are applicable to national banks with limited provisions for exceptions 
in general  the national bank standard restricts loans to a single borrower to no more than of a bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus  plus an additional if the loan is collateralized by certain readily marketable collateral 
real estate is not included in the definition of readily marketable collateral 
at december   the maximum that wsb could have loaned to one borrower and related entities was million  while the largest amount of loans it had to one borrower was million 
at december   the maximum amount that wtx could have loaned to one borrower and related entities was million  while the largest amount of loans wtx had outstanding to any one borrower was million 
depositor preference 
as a result of federal laws that apply to insured depository institutions  claims of general unsecured creditors of wsb would be subordinated to claims of a receiver for administrative expenses and claims of holders of deposit liabilities of wsb including the fdic  as the subrogee of those holders in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of wsb 
as of december   wsb had approximately billion of deposits outstanding on a consolidated basis 
powers of the fdic in connection with the insolvency of an insured depository institution 
if the fdic is appointed a receiver or conservator of an insured depository institution  such as wsb or wtx  the fdic may disaffirm or repudiate any contract or lease to which the institution is a party  the performance of which is determined to be burdensome  and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined to promote the orderly administration of the institution s affairs 
the fdic may contend that its power to repudiate contracts likely extends to obligations such as the debt of the depository institution  and at least one court has held that the fdic can repudiate publicly traded debt obligations 
the effect of a repudiation would likely be to accelerate the maturity of debt 
a repudiation would likely result in a claim by each holder of debt against the receivership or conservatorship 
the claim may be for principal and interest accrued through the date of the appointment of the conservator or receiver 
alternatively  at least one court has held that the claim would be in the amount of the fair market value of the debt as of the date of the repudiation  which amount could be more or less than accrued principal and interest 
the amount paid on the claims of the holders of the debt would depend  among other factors  upon the amount of conservatorship or receivership assets available for the payment of unsecured claims and the priority of the claims relative to the claims of other unsecured creditors and depositors  and may be less than the amount owed to the holders of the debt 
see depositor preference above 
if the maturity of the debt were so accelerated  and a claim relating to the debt paid by the conservatorship or receivership  the holders of the debt might not be able  depending upon economic conditions  to reinvest any amounts paid on the debt at a rate of interest comparable to that paid on the debt 
in addition  although the holders of the debt may have the right to accelerate the debt in the event of the appointment of a conservator or receiver of wsb or wtx  the fdic as conservator or receiver may enforce most types of contracts  including debt contracts pursuant to their terms  notwithstanding any such acceleration provision 
the fdic as conservator or receiver may also transfer to a new obligor any of the depository institution s assets and liabilities  without the approval or consent of the institution s creditors 
in its resolutions of the problems of an insured depository institution in default or in danger of default  the fdic is generally obligated to satisfy its obligations to insured depositors at the least possible cost to the deposit insurance fund 
in addition  the fdic may not take any action that would have the effect of increasing the losses to the relevant deposit insurance fund by protecting depositors for more than the insured portion of deposits generally  or by protecting creditors other than depositors 
existing law authorizes the fdic to settle all uninsured and unsecured claims in the insolvency of an insured institution by making a final payment after the declaration of insolvency 
such a payment would constitute full payment and disposition of the fdic s obligations to claimants 
existing law provides that the rate of such final payment is to be a percentage reflecting the fdic s receivership recovery experience

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview headquartered in oakland  california  golden west financial corporation golden west or company is one of the nation s largest financial institutions with assets of billion as of december  the company s principal operating subsidiary is world savings bank  fsb wsb 
wsb has a subsidiary world savings bank  fsb texas wtx 
as of december   the company operated savings and lending offices in states under the world name 
the company is a residential mortgage portfolio lender 
in order to increase net earnings under this business model  management focuses principally on o growing net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans and other investments and the interest paid on customer deposits and borrowings  o maintaining a healthy primary spread  which is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of deposits and borrowings  o expanding the adjustable rate mortgage arm portfolio  which is the company s primary earning asset  o managing interest rate risk  principally by originating and retaining monthly adjusting arms in portfolio  and matching these arms with liabilities that respond in a similar manner to changes in interest rates  o managing credit risk  principally by originating high quality loans to minimize nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructured  and o controlling expenses 
in review in  interest rates fell to the lowest levels since the low short and long term interest rates in facilitated the continuation of the three year old mortgage refinance boom  bolstered home sales  and spurred national homeownership to reach its highest level ever at of households  up from in due to the unprecedented consumer demand for home loans in  national mortgage originations set an all time high for the third consecutive year  with lending on one to four family homes reaching trillion  or higher than the previous record of trillion set just a year earlier 
historically  a low interest rate environment such as tends to favor fixed rate mortgages over arms because consumers are drawn to fixed rate loans to lock in low payments for the long term 
despite these challenging competitive conditions for arm lenders  golden west turned in record loan origination numbers in of billion  of which billion  or  were in the form of arms  almost all of which adjust monthly in response to changes in short term interest rates

the largest asset component is loans receivable and mbs  which consists primarily of residential mortgages 
the company emphasizes adjustable rate mortgages arms loans with interest rates that change periodically in accordance with movements in specified indexes 
almost all of the company s arms have interest rates that change monthly and are tied to one of the following three indexes the certificate of deposit index codi is based on the monthly rate of three month certificates of deposits secondary market  as published by the federal reserve board 
codi is calculated by adding the twelve most recently published monthly rates together and dividing the result by twelve 
the eleventh district cost of funds index cofi  which is equal to the monthly average cost of deposits and borrowings of savings institution members of the federal home loan bank system s eleventh district  which is composed of california  arizona  and nevada 
the golden west cost of savings index cosi  which is equal to the monthend weighted average rate paid on the company s deposits 
the company originates arms that allow borrowers to select an initial monthly payment amount fixed for one year that is lower than the payment amount that would be necessary to fully amortize the loan over its scheduled maturity at its initial rate and term 
the borrower s monthly payment is reset annually  up or down  subject to a limit on payment increases as discussed below 
if the borrower s monthly payment is not large enough to pay the monthly interest owed on the loan  the unpaid interest is added to the outstanding loan balance as deferred interest 
the borrower may pay down the balance of deferred interest in whole or in part at any time 
the annual payment reset is based on the amount that is sufficient to amortize the outstanding loan balance at the then applicable interest rate on the loan over the remaining term of the loan 
however  in order to protect the borrower from large annual payment increases  the new monthly payment for the year may increase by no more than of the prior year s monthly payment amount 
every five years  beginning with either the fifth or the tenth annual payment change  the payment may be reset without regard to the payment change limitation in order to amortize the loan fully over its remaining term 
in addition  the company originates a small volume of modified arms  that is arms with initial interest rates and monthly payments fixed for periods of to months  after which the interest rate adjusts monthly and the monthly payment is reset annually as described above 
from time to time  as part of the company s loan retention efforts  the company may temporarily modify certain terms of the loan 
additionally  at the borrower s request  the company may convert an arm to a fixed rate mortgage 
the company sells most arms that are converted to fixed rate mortgages 
asset liability management the company s earnings depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the amounts it receives from interest and dividends earned on loans  mbs  and investments and the amounts it pays in interest on deposits and borrowings 
the company is subject to interest rate risk to the extent its assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts 
repricing of an asset and a liability is the change in rate due to maturity  prepayment  the movement of an interest rate index  or any other interest rate change 
the disparity between the repricing of assets mortgage loans  mbs  and investment and the repricing of liabilities deposits and borrowings can have a material impact on the company s net interest income and net earnings 
the difference between the response of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates is commonly referred to as the gap or the repricing gap 
the gap table on the following page shows the volume of assets and liabilities that reprice within certain time periods as of december  if all repricing assets and liabilities responded equally to changes in the interest rate environment  then gap analysis would suggest that golden west s earnings would rise when interest rates increase and would fall when interest rates decrease 
however  golden west s repricing assets and liabilities do not respond equally to changes in the interest rate environment due to the built in reporting and repricing lags inherent in the adjustable rate mortgage indexes used by the company 
reporting lags occur because of the time it takes to gather the data needed to compute the indexes 
repricing lags occur because it may take a period of time before changes in interest rates are significantly reflected in the indexes 
on balance  the reporting and repricing lags cause the company s assets to initially reprice more slowly than the company s liabilities 
for more discussion  see net interest income on page codi  which is the index golden west uses to determine the rate on billion of its existing adjustable rate mortgages  has a one month reporting lag 
codi also has a repricing lag  because the index is a month rolling average and consequently trails changes in short term market interest rates 
cofi  which is the index golden west uses to determine the rate on billion of its existing adjustable rate mortgages  has a two month reporting lag 
as a result  the cofi in effect in any month actually reflects the eleventh district s cost of funds at the level it was two months prior 
cofi also has a repricing lag because cofi is based on a portfolio of liabilities  not all of which reprice immediately 
many of these liabilities  including certificates of deposit and fixed rate borrowings  do not reprice each month 
in addition  when certificates of deposit do reprice  they may not reflect the full change in market rates 
some liabilities  such as low rate checking or passbook savings accounts  may reprice by only small amounts 
still other liabilities  such as noninterest bearing deposits  do not reprice at all 
therefore  cofi does not fully reflect a change in market interest rates 
cosi  which is the index golden west uses to determine the rate on billion of its existing adjustable rate mortgages  has a one month reporting lag 
cosi also has a repricing lag  because the rates paid on many of the deposits that make up cosi do not respond immediately or fully to a change in market interest rates 
however  the cosi repricing lag is offset by the same repricing lag on the company s deposits 
partially offsetting the index reporting and repricing lags are similar lags on portions of the company s liabilities

e liabilities with no maturity date  such as checking  passbook  and money market deposit accounts  are assigned zero months 
the company s principal strategy to limit the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is to originate and keep in portfolio arms that provide interest sensitivity to the asset side of the balance sheet 
at december   arms constituted of the company s loan and mbs portfolio 
asset rate sensitivity is further enhanced by the use of adjustable rate mortgages on which the rate changes monthly 
at december   such monthly adjustable mortgages accounted for of the company s arm portfolio 
additionally  the company emphasizes home loans tied to certain adjustable rate mortgage indexes so that the arm index rates and the rates on the liabilities that fund these mortgages respond in a similar manner to changes in market rates 
specifically  cosi indexed arms track the company s cost of deposits and codi indexed arms follow the company s cost of borrowings 
arms indexed to cosi and codi constituted of the arm originations in and of the arm portfolio at december  while the index strategy has improved the match between golden west s arm portfolio and its savings and borrowings  there still exist some differences in the timing of the repricing of the company s arms and liabilities  primarily due to lags in the repricing of the indexes  particularly codi and cofi 
in addition to the index lags  other elements of arm loans can have an impact on earnings 
these elements are interest rate caps or limits on individual rate changes  interest rate floors  the interest rate adjustment frequency of arm loans  and introductory fixed rates on new arm loans 
when the interest rate environment changes  the index lags and arm structural features cause assets to reprice more slowly than liabilities  enhancing earnings when rates are falling and restraining earnings when rates are rising 
from time to time  the company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy in order to alter the repricing characteristics of designated assets and liabilities see interest rate swaps on pages and 
the table on the following page shows the company s expected cash flows and applicable yields on the balances of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities as of december   taking into consideration expected prepayments of the company s long term assets primarily mbs and loans receivable

c the total weighted average interest rate for variable rate loans receivable reflects loans with introductory rates in effect at december  those loans are assumed to mature outside the introductory period at fully indexed rates the fully indexed rate is equal to the effective index plus the loan margin 
consequently  the weighted average rate of all maturing variable rate loans will not equal the weighted average rate of total variable rate loans at december  as indicated in the total balance column 
d deposits with no maturity are included in the column 
the company estimates the sensitivity of its net interest income  net earnings  and capital ratios to interest rate changes and anticipated growth based on simulations using an asset liability model which takes into account the lags previously described 
the simulation model projects net interest income  net earnings  and capital ratios based on a significant interest rate increase that is sustained for a thirty six month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
for mortgage assets  the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on prepayment rates  which are based on the company s historical prepayment information 
the model also factors in projections for loan and liability growth 
based on the information and assumptions in effect at december   a basis point rate increase sustained over a thirty six month period would initially  but temporarily  reduce the company s primary spread  and would not adversely affect the company s long term profitability and financial strength

included in the balance of loans receivable are net deferred loan costs associated with originating loans 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company defers loan origination fees and certain loan origination costs 
the net deferred loan costs are then amortized as a yield reduction over the life of the related loans  thereby lowering net interest income and the reported yield on the company s loan portfolio 
as shown in the following table  the net deferred loan costs balance grew by million between january  and december  this growth resulted primarily from the growth in loan origination volume

among other things  the loan amount may not exceed of the appraised value of a single family residence at the time of origination 
also  most first mortgage loans with an ltv over carry mortgage insurance  which reimburses the company for losses up to a specified percentage per loan  thereby reducing the effective ltv to below 
furthermore  the company sells without recourse a significant portion of its second mortgage originations 
sales of second mortgages amounted to million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively

during the years   and  loan repayments excluding mbs amounted to billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
the increase in loan repayment in was due to growth in the balance of loans receivable and an increase in the prepayment rate 
the increase in loan repayments in was due to an increase in the balance of loans receivable outstanding partially offset by a decrease in the prepayment rate 
securitized loans the company securitized billion and billion of loans for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the second and third quarters of  the company securitized billion of loans 
these securitized loans are available to be used as collateral for borrowings and are classified as loans receivable on the statement of financial condition 
mortgage backed securities at december    and  the company had mbs held to maturity in the amount of billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
the company has the ability and intent to hold these mbs until maturity and  accordingly  these mbs are classified as held to maturity 
the decrease in mbs held to maturity in was due to prepayments  partially offset by the purchase of million of mbs for community reinvestment act purposes 
the large decrease in was due primarily to prepayments and to the desecuritization of billion of fannie mae mbs

mbs repayments were lower in and due to a decrease in the outstanding balance 
mbs repayments were higher in due to an increase in the prepayment rate on the underlying loans 
mortgage servicing rights the company recognizes as assets the rights to service mortgage loans for others 
when the servicing rights are retained by the company upon the sale of loans  the allocated cost of these rights is then capitalized as an asset 
the amount capitalized is based on the relative fair value of the servicing rights and the mortgage loan on the date the mortgage loan is sold 
capitalized mortgage servicing rights cmsrs are included in other assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
the following table shows the changes in capitalized mortgage servicing rights for the years ended december    and table capitalized mortgage servicing rights dollars in thousands beginning balance of cmsrs    new cmsrs from loan sales    amortization of cmsrs    ending balance of cmsrs    the estimated amortization of the december  cmsr balance for the five years ending is million  million  million  million  and million 
actual results may vary depending upon the level of the payoffs of the loans currently serviced 
cmsrs are reviewed monthly for impairment based on fair value 
the estimated fair value of cmsrs as of december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the book value of golden west s cmsrs did not exceed the fair value at december    or and  therefore  no impairment was required to be recognized 
asset quality an important measure of the soundness of the company s loan and mbs portfolio is its ratio of nonperforming assets npas and troubled debt restructured tdrs to total assets 
nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans that is  loans  including loans securitized into mbs with recourse  that are days or more past due and real estate acquired through foreclosure 
no interest is recognized on nonaccrual loans 
the company s tdrs are made up of loans on which delinquent payments have been capitalized or on which temporary interest rate reductions have been made  primarily to customers impacted by adverse economic conditions 
the table on the next page sets forth the components of the company s npas and tdrs and the various ratios to total assets at december   and table nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructured dollars in thousands as of december nonaccrual loans    foreclosed real estate    total nonperforming assets    tdrs   ratio of npas to total assets

ratio of npas and tdrs to total assets 


the balance of npas at yearend reflected the impact of an improving economy and the strong housing market 
however  continued economic weakness in a few geographical areas of the us contributed to a small increase in foreclosed real estate in the balance of npas at yearends and reflected normal increases in delinquencies associated with the aging of the large volume of mortgages originated during the prior two years together with the uncertain us economy 
the company closely monitors all delinquencies and takes appropriate steps to protect its interests 
the company mitigates its credit risk through strict underwriting standards and loan reviews 
also  the company uses mortgage insurance as previously discussed on page the company has other impaired loans on which specific loss reserves have been provided and that were not included in nonperforming loans or troubled debt restructured because the loans were performing in full accordance with the loan terms 
other impaired loans amounted to million at yearend compared to million and million at yearends and  respectively 
allowance for loan losses the company provides specific valuation allowances for losses on major loans when impaired  and a write down on foreclosed real estate when any significant and permanent decline in value is identified 
the company also utilizes a methodology for monitoring and estimating probable loan losses in the loan portfolio that is based on both the company s historical loss experience and factors reflecting current economic conditions 
this approach uses a database that identifies and measures losses on loans and foreclosed real estate from past years to the present  broken down by year of origination  type of loan  and geographical area 
this process also takes into consideration current trends in economic growth  unemployment  housing market activity  and home prices for the nation and individual geographical regions 
the approach further considers the impact of other events such as natural disasters 
based on the analysis of historical performance  current conditions  and other risks  management estimates a range of loss allowances by type of loan and risk category to cover probable losses in the portfolio 
one to four single family real estate loans are evaluated as a group 
in addition  periodic reviews are made of major multi family and commercial real estate loans and foreclosed real estate 
where indicated  valuation allowances are established or adjusted 
in estimating probable losses  consideration is given to the estimated sale price  cost of refurbishing the security property  payment of delinquent taxes  cost of disposal  and cost of holding the property 
additions to and reductions from the allowances are reflected in current earnings based upon quarterly reviews of the portfolio 
the review methodology and historical analyses are reviewed quarterly

ratio of allowance for loan losses to npas deposits the company raises deposits through its retail branch system  through the internet  and from time to time  through the money markets 
retail deposits increased by billion in compared to increases of billion and billion in and  respectively 
retail deposits increased during these three years because the public found money market accounts to be a more favorable investment compared with other alternatives and the company successfully promoted those accounts

advances from federal home loan banks the company uses borrowings from the federal home loan banks fhlbs  also known as advances  to provide funds for loan origination activities 
advances are secured by pledges of certain loans  mbs  and capital stock of the fhlbs owned by the company 
fhlb advances amounted to billion at december   compared to billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
other borrowings the company borrows funds through transactions in which securities are sold under agreements to repurchase reverse repos 
reverse repos are entered into with selected major government securities dealers and large banks  using mbs from the company s portfolio as collateral

under firrea  savings institutions must have tangible capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  have core capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  and have risk based capital equal to at least of risk weighted assets 
the office of thrift supervision ots and other bank regulatory agencies have established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the rules provide that a savings institution is well capitalized if its leverage ratio is or greater  its tier risk based capital ratio is or greater  its total risk based capital ratio is or greater  and the institution is not subject to a capital directive 
as used in the discussion  the total risk based capital ratio is the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets  the tier risk based capital ratio is the ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets  and the tier or leverage ratio is the ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets  in each case as calculated in accordance with current ots capital regulations

there are no conditions or events that have occurred since that notification that the company believes would have an adverse impact on how wsb or wtx are categorized 
the payments of capital distributions by wsb and wtx to their parent are governed by ots regulation 
wsb and wtx must at least file a notice with the ots prior to making capital distributions and  in some cases  may need to file applications 
the ots may disapprove a notice or deny an application  in whole or in part  if the ots finds that a the insured subsidiary would be undercapitalized or worse following the proposed capital distribution  b the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns  or c the proposed capital distribution violates a prohibition contained in any statute  regulation  agreement with the ots  or a condition imposed upon the insured subsidiary in an ots approved application or notice 
in general  wsb and wtx may  with prior notice to the ots  make capital distributions during a calendar year in an amount equal to that year s net income plus retained net income for the preceding two years  as long as immediately after such distributions it remains at least adequately capitalized 
capital distributions in excess of such amount  or which would cause wsb or wtx to no longer be adequately capitalized  require specific ots approval

uses of estimates golden west s financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
most of golden west s assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses are reported using actual results for the reporting period 
however  gaap requires that certain assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses be reported using estimates of fair value that are based on a variety of assumptions  including such items as future interest rate levels and repayments rates 
as a consequence  assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses reported using fair value estimates may fluctuate from one reporting period to the next because of changes in the business environment that lead to revisions to the assumptions underlying the fair value calculations 
the following is a discussion of the most critical accounting policies involving the use of estimates 
an important use of estimates occurs when the company establishes its allowance for loan losses 
an in depth discussion can be found in the allowance for loan losses section on page for the year ended december  and  golden west s consolidated statement of net earnings reflected fair value estimates for the company s interest rate swap portfolio  amounting to a pre tax gain of million and a pre tax gain of million  respectively  as seen in change in fair value of derivatives 
in addition  upon the adoption of sfas on january   golden west reported a one time pre tax charge of million associated with the initial valuation of the company s interest rate swap portfolio 
for the year ended december   these fair value changes related to sfas were the principal fair value items affecting golden west s earnings 
fair value estimates are based on quoted market prices for interest rate swaps 
additionally  pursuant to gaap  golden west establishes capitalized mortgage servicing rights when the company sells mortgage loans and retains the servicing for them 
the company periodically reviews the cmsrs for impairment based on fair value 
golden west s cmsrs have never experienced impairment 
golden west s cmsr balances amounted to million and million at yearend and  respectively

net interest income the largest component of the company s revenue and earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans and other investments and the interest paid on customer deposits and borrowings 
long term growth of the company s net interest income  and hence earnings  is related to the ability to expand the mortgage portfolio  the company s primary earning asset  by originating and retaining high quality adjustable rate home loans 
over the short term  however  net interest income can be influenced by business conditions  especially movements in short term interest rates  which can temporarily affect the level of net interest income 
net interest income amounted to billion  billion  and billion for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these amounts represented   and increases  respectively  over the previous years 
the increase in net interest income in compared with the prior year resulted primarily from the growth in the loan portfolio  the company s principal earning asset 
between december  and december   the company s earning asset balance increased by billion or 
this growth resulted from strong mortgage originations which more than offset loan repayments and loan sales 
partially offsetting the benefit to net interest income of a larger average earning asset balance in  was a modest decrease in the company s average primary spread  which is the monthly average of the monthend difference between the yield on loans and other investments and the rate paid on deposits and borrowings 
the significant growth of net interest income in compared with the prior year resulted from both the expansion of the company s earning assets and an increase in the company s average primary spread 
the level and movement of the company s primary spread are influenced by a variety of factors including the amount and speed of movements in market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  that is the difference between short term and long term interest rates  competition in the home lending market  which influences the pricing of the company s adjustable and fixed rate mortgage products  the company s need for deposits and competition in the retail savings market  which influence the pricing of the company s deposit products  and the prices that the company pays for its borrowings 
on a year to year basis  the most significant factor that leads to changes in the company s primary spread is market interest rate movements  as discussed below 
as noted in the discussion of the gap on page  the cost of the company s liabilities responds more rapidly to movements in short term market interest rates than the yield on the company s assets  most of which are arms tied to indexes that lag changes in interest rates 
consequently  when interest rates decline  the company s primary spread temporarily widens  because the index lags slow the downward movement of the yield on the company s adjustable rate mortgage portfolio 
when interest rates stabilize after a period of falling rates  the primary spread usually declines temporarily until the yield on the arm portfolio catches up to previous rate decreases 
the opposite occurs when interest rates increase 
specifically  when short term interest rates move up  the company s primary spread compresses for a period of time  because the index lags slow the upward adjustment of the yield on the company s arms 
when interest rates stabilize after a period of rising rates  the primary spread expands temporarily until the arm yield catches up to previous rate increases 
for the five years ended december   which included periods of both falling and rising interest rates  the company s primary spread averaged 
during  the federal reserve s open market committee lowered the federal funds rate  a key short term interest rate  by a total of basis points in order to stimulate the then weak economy 
other short term market rates experienced similar decreases 
in response to significantly lower short term interest rates  the company s cost of funds declined by basis points during  while the yield on the company s assets fell by only basis points 
as a consequence  the company s primary spread widened substantially during  and by yearend reached  the highest level in the company s history 
in  the federal funds rate remained steady at until november  when the federal reserve s open market committee lowered the federal funds rate by basis points to 
during  the company s cost of funds declined by an additional basis points 
at the same time  the company s asset yield fell by basis points  as the arm indexes continued to adjust downward in response to the large interest rate declines experienced in because the yield on earning assets fell faster than the cost of funds in  the company s primary spread narrowed from at december  to at december  on june   the federal reserve s open market committee lowered the federal funds rate by an additional basis points to 
reflecting the decline of short term interest rates at the end of and the rate decrease in june  the company s cost of funds declined by basis points during  while the yield on the company s assets fell by points 
the following table shows the components of the company s primary spread at the end of the years through table yield on earning assets  cost of funds  and primary spread december yield on loan portfolio and mbs yield on investments

interest rate swaps from time to time  the company enters into interest rate swaps as a part of its interest rate risk management strategy 
such instruments are entered into primarily to alter the repricing characteristics of designated assets and liabilities

after tax per diluted share for the year ended december  and a pre tax expense of million  or 
after tax per diluted share for the year ended december  this additional income and expense occurred because the fair value of golden west s swaps changed in   and as a result of interest rate movements 
because the company intends to hold these interest rate swaps to maturity  valuation gains and losses will net to zero over the lives of the swaps 
the changes in fair value of these swap contracts are reflected as a net liability on the consolidated statement of financial condition with corresponding amounts reported in noninterest income as the change in fair value of derivatives in the consolidated statement of net earnings
