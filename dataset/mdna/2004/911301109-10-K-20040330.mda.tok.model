item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein 
overview we are a specialty finance company engaged primarily in non prime automobile finance and insurance premium finance 
we fund our finance businesses mainly with retail and wholesale bank deposits held by our wholly owned subsidiary  pan american bank  fsb  a federally chartered savings association  or the bank 
our automobile finance business is conducted through united auto credit corporation  or uacc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank 
uacc purchases and holds for investment nonprime automobile installment sales contracts  or automobile contracts  originated by independent and franchised dealers of used automobiles 
our insurance premium finance business is conducted through a joint venture agreement with bpn corporation  or bpn 
under this agreement  the bank finances consumer automobile and small business insurance premiums 
bpn markets this financing primarily to independent insurance agents in california 
we are currently analyzing different strategic alternatives to decrease our reliance on insured deposits of the bank as a funding sources for our automobile finance and insurance premium finance businesses as non prime lending has been and continues to be an area of lending which has been the subject of extraordinary regulatory concern and scrutiny among all of the federal banking regulatory authorities  including the ots 
the ots has notified us that the bank is considered by the ots to have an unacceptable level of risk for a federally insured thrift because we are deemed by the ots to have an excessive concentration risk in automobile loans  all of which are non prime in nature 
these automobile sales contracts represent approximately of the bank s total assets 
the balance of the bank s assets consist primarily of mortgage backed securities 
our board of directors has decided to implement a plan to exit the federal thrift charter of the bank in light of the increasing regulatory requirements associated with financing the non prime automobile business with insured deposits 
for more information see liquidity and capital resources general 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies  which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
certain accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and we consider these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
uacc purchases automobile contracts at a discount from face value 
historically  the bank has accounted for the purchase of automobile contracts by recording the automobile contract at face value  and allocating the remainder to the allowance for credit losses and unearned income 
this method resulted in estimated expected credit losses over the life of the contract being provided at the date of purchase and the credit adjusted yield being recorded as interest income over the life of the automobile contract 
after consulting with the ots  commencing january   the bank began to allocate the purchase price entirely to automobile contracts and unearned discount at the date of purchase 
the allowance for loan losses on uacc contracts purchased prior to january  was not adjusted and the change was applied prospectively to all contracts purchased after december  as of december  the allowance for loan losses for uacc loans was million and represented management s estimate of credit losses over the remaining life of the outstanding contracts 
as losses are 
table of contents experienced on these contracts  they are applied to this existing balance 
management continues to evaluate the allowance related to contracts acquired prior to december  should management s estimate of credit losses over the life of the pre contracts change  an additional provision for loan losses would be charged to earnings at the time of the change in estimate 
the unearned discount on contracts purchased after january  will be accreted as an adjustment to yield over the life of the automobile contract 
an allowance for credit losses for these contracts will be established through provisions for losses recorded in income as necessary to provide for estimated automobile contract losses net of remaining unearned discount at each reporting date 
we initially maintained an allowance for inherent losses incurred estimated to be equal to net charge offs for the next six months for contracts purchased after january  we believed this was an adequate allowance  in light of our historical experience  our assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio  prior loss experience  the levels and trends of non performing loans  current and prospective economic conditions and other factors 
in the third quarter of  after consultation with the ots  we changed our estimate to maintain an allowance for all contracts in this portfolio to cover estimated charge offs for the next months instead of months 
the impact of this change in accounting estimate totaled million and is included in our million provision for loan losses in the third quarter of to increase the allowance for loan losses to the required level 
this charge equates to approximately million after tax or per diluted share in the third quarter of the increase to months will result in higher levels of allowances on new automobile contracts purchased in the future  thereby decreasing earnings by the amount of the increased level of allowance offset by interest income 
the bank s loan loss allowances are monitored by management based on a variety of factors including an assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio  prior loss experience  the levels and trends of nonperforming loans  current and prospective economic conditions and other factors 
management also undertakes a review of various quantitative and qualitative analyses 
quantitative analyses include the review of charge off trends by loan type  analysis of cumulative losses and evaluation of credit loss experienced by credit tier and geographic location 
other quantitative analyses include the concentration of any credit tier  the level of nonperformance and the percentage of delinquency 
qualitative analysis include trends in charge offs over various time periods and at various statistical midpoints and high points  the severity of depreciated values of repossession and trends in the economy generally or in specific geographic locations 
we established our allowance for loan losses by using the greater of the expected month charge off method which establishes allowances based on an analysis that sums the expected charge offs for the next months in each static loss pool or the classification reserve method which establishes allowances based on satisfactory  substandard and doubtful loan classifications 
the classification reserve method ensures that changes over the next months in loan concentrations  quality and terms are reflected in the allowance 
the classification reserve method also ensures that changes and trends in non performing loans over the next months are included in the allowance 
non performing changes affect the allowance through the classification reserve method  in which a percent of satisfactory  substandard and doubtful accounts are totaled to determine the overall classification reserve method requirement 
the classification reserve requirement is compared to the expected net charge offs for the next months and the greater of the two is the policy reserve level  which is then compared to the allowance level to ensure adequacy 
despite these analyses  we recognize that establishing an allowance is an estimate  which is inherently uncertain and depends on the outcome of further events 
our operating results and financial conditions are sensitive to changes in our estimate for loan losses and the estimate s underlying assumptions 
our operating results and financial condition are immediately impacted as changes in estimates for calculating loan loss reserves immediately pass through our income statement as an additional provision expense 
management updates our loan loss estimates quarterly to reflect current charge offs 

table of contents results of operations comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general in we reported income of million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share for interest income in increased to million compared with million in while net interest income increased to million in from million in gross automobile receivables were million at december  compared to million at december   accounting for much of the increase in interest income and net interest income 
additionally in  the bank began accreting the unearned discount on purchased contracts as an adjustment to yield over the life of the automobile contract 
interest income interest income increased to million in from million in due primarily to a million increase in average interest earning assets  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average interest rate on interest earning assets 
the largest components of growth in our average interest earning assets were automobile contracts  which increased million in  and investment securities  which increased million in the increase in automobile contracts principally resulted from the purchase of additional automobile contracts in existing and new markets consistent with the planned growth of this business unit 
the increase in investment securities was primarily a result of the increase in assets required for the bank to meet the qtl test under federal regulatory requirements 
the decline in the average yield on interest earning assets was principally due to a general decline in the market interest rates and to the increase in securities  which have lower yields compared to loans 
securities  with an average yield of  comprised of our average interest earning assets for securities  with an average yield of  comprised of our average interest earning assets for interest expense interest expense increased to million in from million in  due to a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average interest rate on interest bearing liabilities 
the largest components of the increase in interest bearing liabilities were deposits of the bank  which increased to an average balance of million in from an average balance of million in  and borrowings under repurchase agreements  which increased to an average balance of million in from an average balance of million in the increase in borrowings under repurchase agreements resulted from the necessity to increase assets to comply with the test of the ots

table of contents rate and volume analysis the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense from continuing operations during the periods indicated

the recovery of expense in the insurance premium finance business occurred because our portfolio mix for insurance premium loans changed during and our portfolio experienced a decrease in higher loss consumer transactions and an increase in lower loss commercial transactions 
as a result  and have shown a substantial decrease in charge offs in the insurance premium finance business 
therefore  the allowance for loan losses for our insurance premium finance business required a negative provision expense 
the provision for loan losses associate with the insurance premium finance business was  in the total allowance for loan losses was million at december  compared with million at december   representing of loans at december  and at december  annualized net charge offs to average loans were for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses for was favorably impacted by the recovery of  from the state of california for refund of sales taxes on repossessed automobiles 
we applied for this refund of sales taxes based on a memorandum of opinion issued by the board of equalization of the state of california in wherein the state of california was required to refund sales taxes that had been paid on the loss portion of a repossessed automobile since january all amounts charged off 
table of contents on an automobile loan are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
thus  when we received a refund of sales taxes from the state of california  we returned the entire portion of that sales tax refund to the allowance account 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on our regular evaluation of loans held for investment and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management believes it has adequately provided for losses and does not expect any material loss on its loans in excess of allowances already recorded  no assurance can be given that economic or other market conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio

through such management  we seek to reduce the exposure of our operations to changes in interest rates 
our board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis our asset liability position  including simulation of the effect on capital of various interest rate scenarios 
our profits depend  in part  on the difference  or spread  between the effective rate of interest received on the loans it originates and the interest rates paid on deposits and other financing facilities  which can be adversely affected by movements in interest rates 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by the board of directors and management through the use of a model  which estimates the change in the bank s net portfolio value  or npv  over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities  and npv ratio is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
we utilize a market value model based on the bank s quarterly financial information 

table of contents the following table shows the npv and projected change in the npv of the bank at december   the most recent date for which the relevant npv model is available  assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of  and basis points

although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
management monitors the results of this modeling  which are presented to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
liquidity and capital resources general our primary source of funds are deposits at the bank and commercial repurchase agreements  and  to a lesser extent  fhlb advances  interest payments on short term investments and proceeds from the maturation of securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we are currently analyzing different strategic alternatives to decrease our reliance on insured deposits of the bank as a funding source for our automobile finance and insurance premium finance business as non prime lending has been and continues to be an area of lending which has been the subject of extraordinary regulatory concern and scrutiny among all of the federal banking regulatory authorities  including the ots 
the ots has notified us that the bank is considered by the ots to have an unacceptable level of risk for a federally insured thrift because we are deemed by the ots to have an excessive concentration risk in automobile loans  all of which are non prime in nature 
these automobile sales contracts represent approximately of the bank s total assets 
the balance of the bank s assets consist primarily of mortgage backed securities 
our board of directors has decided to implement a plan to exit the bank s federal thrift charter because of the increasing regulatory requirements associated with financing our non prime automobile finance business with insured deposits 
we intend to pursue strategic financing and other available alternatives  which will enable us to conduct our non prime automobile lending business outside a federal thrift charter 
in the meantime  we will continue with our planned expansion of our automobile finance branch network and may  from time to time  sell automobile receivables in order to control the amount of non prime automobile loans in our portfolio and reduce our reliance on insured deposits of the bank 
once we exit the federal thrift charter  our primary source of funds will no longer be deposits at the bank or fhlb advances 

table of contents historically we have continued to maintain adequate levels of liquid assets to fund our operations 
management  through its asset and liability committee  monitors rates and terms of competing sources of funds to use the most cost effective source of funds wherever possible 
as we implement strategies to reduce our reliance on insured deposits of the bank as a major source of funds  management intends to continue to use the most cost effective source of funds whenever possible 
alternatives we may consider to reduce our reliance on insured deposits of the bank could include  but not be limited to  warehouse credit lines  secured financing and sale of whole loans from time to time 
the bank obtains deposits through its retail branches in california 
the bank offers checking accounts  various money market accounts  regular passbook accounts  fixed interest rate certificates with varying maturities and retirement accounts 
deposit account terms vary by interest rate  minimum balance requirements and the duration of the account 
interest rates paid  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by the bank periodically based on liquidity and financing requirements  rates paid by competitors  growth goals and federal regulations 
at december   retail deposits were million or of total deposits 
the bank also uses broker originated deposits to supplement its retail deposits and  at december   brokered deposits totaled million or of total deposits 
at december   brokered deposits were million or of total deposits 
brokered deposits are originated through major dealers specializing in such products 
we use several major dealers to originate these deposits so if deposits are not renewed at the end of their term  we will negotiate obtaining deposits from another dealer 
if we are unable to retain a sufficient amount of deposits from all of the dealers  we would consider raising deposits through means of the internet

for the insurance premium finance business loans  management established a level of allowance for loan losses based on recent trends in delinquencies and historical charge offs  currently of loans  that it feels adequate for the risk in the portfolio 
each month an amount necessary to reach that level is charged against current earnings and added to allowance for loan losses 
the level of allowance for loan losses was reduced from of loans at december  to the current of loans at december  because of a substantial reduction in loan losses in the first quarter of this reduction in losses resulted primarily from a change in the loan mix from automobile insurance premium loans to commercial insurance premium loans  which have lower expected losses
