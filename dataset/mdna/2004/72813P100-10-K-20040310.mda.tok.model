business segments and product lines we are organized in three divisions  which allows us to focus more effectively on individual product lines  category management initiatives and certain specialty classes of trade 
our two largest divisions  the personal products division and the consumer products division  constituted approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal and fiscal and in fiscal personal products division the personal products division accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal this division includes infant care and feminine care products sold in the united states primarily to mass merchandisers  supermarkets and drug classes of trade 
the infant care product category includes infant feeding products other infant care products playtex disposable nurser system  diaper genie diaper disposal system  playtex cups and mealtime products  wet ones pre moistened towelettes  playtex reusable hard bottles  and baby magic baby toiletries  playtex pacifiers 
baby magic baby wipes  and mr 
bubble children s bubble bath 
the feminine care product category includes a wide range of plastic and flushable applicator tampons  as well as complementary products  marketed under such brand names as tampons complementary products playtex gentle glide  playtex personal cleansing cloths playtex portables  for use in feminine hygiene  and playtex slimfits  playtex heat therapy patch to playtex silk glide  and alleviate discomfort associated playtex beyond 
with menstrual pain 
infant care infant care accounted for approximately of personal products net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal our largest infant care business is infant feeding products  in which we held a market leading dollar market share in we are particularly strong in both the disposable feeding and the infant cup categories with dollar market shares of and  respectively 
we are also strong in the diaper pail category with our dollar market share leading diaper genie brand 
in pre moistened towelettes  our wet ones brand held a dollar market share of the hand and face segment 
our mr 
bubble brand held a dollar market share of the bath additives category and became the market share leader in this category during fiscal baby magic held an dollar market share of the infant toiletries category and is strongest in the lotions and bath segments with dollar market share of each of those segments 
our strategy for maintaining market leadership positions is centered on continually offering new infant care solutions as well as improving existing products and expanding the size of the category  marketing directly to expectant mothers through specialized channels such as industry publications and pediatricians  and cross selling opportunities across all product lines 
disposable feeding reusable bottles we offer both disposable feeding systems and reusable bottles in addition to nipples and other complementary products marketed under the playtex brand 
historically  we have focused on the disposable segment  as we believe that disposable bottle liners are healthier and more convenient than traditional reusable bottles 
the disposable collapsible liner placed inside the holder limits the amount of air in take by the baby and reduces painful spit ups and burping 
our drop ins  patented  ready formed disposable liners  made disposable liners much easier for parents to use and since its introduction has driven improved market share 
our disposable feeding systems currently account for of the disposable feeding category 
in an effort to broaden our product offerings in the reusable bottle segment  we developed ventaire in the ventaire bottle has a patented air venting system that allows air to escape as the baby sucks on the nipple  much like the benefits of a disposable bottle 
in  we will introduce several new products that better align us with the needs of breast feeding mothers 
these new products will help augment breast feeding  such as the ventaire naturalshape nipple  a naturalatch nipple and the one step breast milk storage kit  which allows the consumer to go from breast pump to storage to feeding using our drop ins disposable liner technology 
cups in  we introduced the spill proof cup  an innovation that changed the infant cup category 
prior to this introduction  there was no distinct market segment for children s cups 
with the launch of the spill proof line  the category has expanded from million of retail sales to more than million in we held a market leading dollar market share in over the past few years  we have introduced new products to expand our offerings in the cups segment  including the quickstraw cup  the big sipster  a cup targeted at older children  and the gripster  made to fit small hands 
in  we introduced the insulator cup line  representing the next generation in cup technology 
the insulator cup is designed to maintain the temperature and freshness of liquids for a longer period of time 
in  we introduced the insulator sport  a new insulated leak proof cup with a flip top straw lid for growing kids and a new trainer cup for toddlers  the first sipster 
in  we added to our cup offerings with the introduction of the sparklin sipster  a clear cup with a distinctive sparkling look 
diaper disposal systems diaper genie  which we acquired in  leads the diaper disposal market with a dollar market share in the diaper genie business is comprised of two segments diaper genie diaper pail unit  and diaper genie liner refills  the largest component of the business 
the diaper pail unit individually seals diapers in an odor proof  germ proof chain 
the unit uses our proprietary refill liners  which typically lasts approximately one month 
in  we improved the diaper pail unit and introduced a new liner 
we improved the cutter cap system  which makes the unit easier to use and we introduced a toddler film refill to the market for older age children  targeted to extend the usage period 
a large percentage of the diaper pail units are given to expectant mothers as gifts 
this provides a unique opportunity to begin cross marketing our entire line of infant care products before the baby arrives 
baby toiletries baby magic  which we acquired in  occupies the number two position among the branded products in the us baby toiletries category defined as lotions  shampoos  powders  bath products  oils and gift packs  with an dollar market share in baby magic is strongest in the lotions and bath segments with dollar market share of each of those segments 
the us baby toiletries category has been extremely competitive since our acquisition of the baby magic brand in in the second quarter of  we introduced a new line of baby magic calming milk products including a foaming bath  bath lotion and massage lotion 
we added a shampoo to the calming milk line in the fourth quarter of our full year market share was down slightly compared to and due to the continued competitive environment 
pre moistened towelettes early in we acquired wet ones  the market share leader in the hands and face segment of the market with a dollar market share in wet ones are used by parents and others in applications other than diaper changing  such as cleaning up after meals or traveling away from home 
the pre moistened towelette category experienced rapid growth over the last few years as competitors entered the category and invested heavily in advertising and promotion to generate trial of their product 
our retail consumption increased and our dollar market share increased percentage points in compared to other infant care brands our mr 
bubble children s bubble bath brand is a widely recognized brand name among consumers and became the market share leader in the bath additives category in mr 
bubble had a dollar market share in in fiscal  we decided to market our domestic baby wipes under the baby magic name and we continue to market chubs internationally 
our infant care marketing is focused on a specific group of people new and expectant mothers 
these consumers undertake an immense amount of research and education  both before the child is born and after  to enhance their ability to make informed decisions concerning the health and welfare of their new infants 
as such  we utilize various techniques to communicate with parents in addition to traditional media advertising 
programs directed at new mothers include the distribution of millions of samples and coupons prenatally via childbirth instructors and postnatally in hospitals 
we also provide educational materials to pediatricians  lactation consultants and hospitals such that new parents receive professional recommendations to use our infant care products 
in addition  we have developed the website www 
playtexbaby 
com to provide information to new and expectant mothers as well as to introduce and market our entire line of infant care products 
across our entire line of infant care products  we communicate an image of quality  health  innovation and convenience to attract and retain users 
feminine care playtex feminine care accounted for approximately of personal products net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal in the tampon category  consumer purchases are driven primarily by comfort  quality  protection and value  leading to intensely strong brand loyalties 
for over years  playtex has been the second largest selling tampon brand overall in the us and currently holds the largest position in the higher growth plastic applicator and deodorant segments 
we have been able to grow our share of the tampon category since through a strategy of offering a diversified product line providing choice for consumers  continuing new product development and product improvements  leveraging the playtex brand  strategically targeting new users young  first time feminine product users  conversion of pad users to tampons  and category expansion through introducing complementary products 
for fiscal  we had a dollar market share of the tampon category 
our overall share of the tampon category grew by percentage points from through and the share differential between playtex and the category share leader has narrowed from approximately percentage points in to approximately percentage points in late in the third quarter of  the market share leader in the tampon category introduced a new plastic applicator tampon product supported with extensive advertising and promotional spending 
while our dollar market share in the tampon category decreased three market share points in due  in part  to the heavily promoted new competitive product  our dollar market share for the month of december was essentially flat versus the same month in we have aggressively defended our market share in the tampon category with advertising support and the introduction of two product improvements including an improved soft pearlized plastic applicator and an improved deodorant fragrance  each of which enhances consumer benefits 
the improved product was introduced in the first quarter of and reached retail shelves in the second quarter 
plastic applicator tampons historically  our core strength has resided in plastic applicator tampons where playtex is the clear leader with a dollar market share and dollar market share of the plastic applicator segment 
though dollar market share declined in given the entry of a competitive plastic product  gentle glide remains the number one plastic brand in the market 
gentle glide is our most significant plastic applicator tampon 
these soft plastic applicator tampons were designed with a smooth rounded tip and a unique double layer construction  allowing for ease of insertion and comfortable fit as well as reliable leakage protection 
our gentle glide line has provided a platform to launch new product enhancements 
in  we launched an improved  softer pearlescent applicator and improved deodorant fragrance 
portables were developed to provide maximum convenience and portability 
to meet consumer demand for smaller products  portables have a compact construction with a two piece applicator that allows the user to discreetly transport and easily assemble the product to a full sized applicator 
additionally  portables are associated with the same level of quality and protection as gentle glide products 
slimfits are designed to appeal to a key niche segment of the tampon category young teenagers 
the introduction of slimfits was a direct result of our strategy to focus on first time feminine care product users 
to promote slimfits  we utilized focused teen awareness campaigns and targeted product sampling 
slimfits have a narrower applicator and pledget providing for greater comfort and ease of insertion 
we believe slimfits will continue to build our business over the long term by encouraging young women to use tampons rather than pads at an earlier age and by developing brand loyalty for our tampons at a time when lifelong preferences are forming 
we believe these teenagers will develop a loyalty to the playtex brand and they will naturally transition to the gentle glide line 
flushable applicator tampons flushable applicator tampons represented approximately of feminine care net sales for the personal products division in fiscal we have a full line of flushable applicator tampons to provide a complete portfolio of product offerings to consumers and to best match a broader array of consumer preferences 
users tend to be loyal to one form of applicator over another  thus  the introduction of a flushable applicator to the tampon product portfolio has allowed us to leverage the playtex brand name to capture a share of the flushable applicator segment 
beyond tampons are an innovative new flushable applicator tampon  which began shipping in january this tampon is targeted to women who want the convenience and flushability of a cardboard applicator tampon with the comfort of a plastic applicator tampon 
the flushable applicator segment remains a significant portion of the tampon market with many women desiring a more comfortable flushable applicator tampon 
we believe this new product will provide us with an opportunity to capture a greater share of the flushable applicator market and help us regain lost market share in the overall tampon category 
silk glide is our original line of flushable applicator tampons 
with the introduction of beyond in the flushable segment  the distribution of silk glide will be limited to the value segment of the marketplace  primarily in dollar store retailers 
complementary feminine care products we introduced two new complementary feminine care products leveraging the consumer trust and strong brand awareness of our tampon franchise 
we have been successful in working with retailers to merchandise these products in the feminine care aisle alongside our tampons to best leverage the playtex brand name 
these products demonstrate our ability to expand the category beyond tampons 
in  we introduced personal cleansing cloths  pre moistened towelettes for feminine hygiene 
it has become the number one brand in this small niche category 
our personal cleansing cloths are formulated with vitamin e and aloe and offer antibacterial efficacy 
we introduced the playtex heat therapy patch in july designed to be discrete and alleviate the discomfort associated with menstrual cramps for up to hours  the playtex patch is differentiated from other heat patches marketed to alleviate other types of discomfort 
consistent with our overall marketing strategy  our marketing efforts in feminine care have leveraged the strength of the playtex brand that caters to the active  young female 
employing a pull strategy  we focus on advertising and selective consumer promotional activity to build our brand equity 
our feminine care marketing strategy centers on attracting first time users and converting feminine protection pad users to tampon users by communicating the advantages of tampon usage 
to that end  several recent advertising campaigns have highlighted the diaper like  bulky nature of the feminine protection pad while promoting the comfort and convenience of tampons 
given our singular focus on tampons  we believe that we are well positioned among our competitors to endorse tampons over pads and we hope to capture a disproportionately high number of new users 
consumer products division the consumer products division accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal this division includes sun care products  household products and personal grooming products sold in the united states  primarily to mass merchandisers  supermarkets and drug classes of trade 
sun care we continue to provide innovative ways to deliver sun protection 
for the season  we are launching surf  an eight hour waterproof instant protection brand 
in  we launched baby magic by banana boat  the mildest instant sun protection available targeting the baby sun care market 
we are extending the successful suntanicals line  which we introduced in  by adding a higher sun protection factor spf and aftersun products to the line 
also for  we have restaged and repackaged much of our line to improve the look and better communicate product benefits 
our sun care products are a strong number two in the us sun care category with a dollar market share in since  banana boat has been able to consistently grow its share of the sun care category through a strategy of providing new and differentiated products  communicating banana boat s family oriented image  thus targeting the most attractive user groups  and working with our customers to best maximize sales and profitability through active category management 
our sun care marketing strategies are directed at the family demographic  where banana boat communicates a fun in the sun for the active wholesome family image 
in addition  the marketing and sales plan for banana boat utilizes a variety of specialized programs such as sweepstakes  sampling at outdoor events  radio tie ins and promotions at new store openings to provide additional visibility for the brand 
our interactive website  www 
bananaboat 
com  conveys educational information in a fun  casual manner 
to supplement our distribution network  we have a direct store delivery dsd distribution team focused in high consumption areas of the us east and gulf coasts 
with a fleet of more than thirty vans and operators with an in depth knowledge of our sun care products  the dsd network allows us to build strong retailer relationships  gather marketing intelligence and ensure that our products are properly stocked on retailer shelves 
industry convention and the seasonal nature of the sun care business require that manufacturers of sun care products provide retailers with the opportunity to return unsold products at the end of the sun care season 
to reflect the impact of potential returns  we provide for estimated returns in our reported operating results as sales are made throughout the year 
the level of returns may fluctuate from our estimates due to several factors including weather conditions  customer inventory levels  and competitive conditions see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations application of critical accounting policies of this annual report on form k 
in  we initiated a more proactive approach to managing late season shipments to retailers 
the initiative is to better align our shipment patterns to retail consumption patterns during the sun care season 
we have continued this proactive process in with the objective of reducing costs associated with returns 
after our first full season of managing shipments and monitoring returns  we see reductions in the amount of returns and their associated handling costs 
household products personal grooming our household products personal grooming business consists of a number of leading and well recognized brands including our woolite rug and upholstery cleaning products  playtex household gloves  ogilvie at home permanents and binaca breath spray and drops 
we also compete in the value priced end of the toothbrush business with our tek and dentax brands of toothbrushes  and in deodorants with our tussy brand 
woolite holds the second branded position in the us rug and upholstery cleaning products category with a dollar market share in driving net sales and market share growth in and were two new products woolite instant power shot non foaming aerosol cleaner designed for quick removal of stains  introduced late in and woolite oxy deep a spray oxygen based carpet cleaner designed to remove tough set in stains  introduced in the third quarter of with a long standing reputation for superior quality  durability and value  playtex gloves have enjoyed market share leadership since we introduced reusable household latex gloves in the us in the playtex brand name is virtually the only well known name in the segment and our living and handsaver brands are recognized as the highest quality reusable household gloves in the industry 
as demand for disposable household gloves grew  we introduced a line of disposable gloves to leverage the playtex brand in this category 
in  we lost two dollar market share points  and in we lost an additional two market share points due to competitive activities and an increase in private label distribution 
our ogilvie brand is the market leader of the at home permanents and straighteners category  with a dollar market share in retail consumption of at home permanent products has been declining due to the tendency of consumers to get their hair permed in professional beauty salons 
our strategy is to grow our market leadership position by repositioning the brand to younger consumers and  as category leader  to positively impact the growth of the category as a whole 
since our acquisition of the ogilvie brand in  we have successfully launched ogilvie straightener  which removes the curl from permed hair  controls the curl from naturally curly hair  and delivers smooth texture to hair 
this product is targeted to younger consumers 
international corporate sales division the international corporate sales division constituted approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal and fiscal and in fiscal the international corporate sales division includes sales to specialty classes of trade in the united states including wholesale results from our canadian and australian subsidiaries  clubs  military  convenience stores  sales in puerto rico  specialty stores  and telemarketing  export sales  and sales of private label tampons 
the international corporate sales division sells the same products as are available to our us customers 
sales to specialty classes of trade represented of the total division s net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal the decrease in sales in the specialty class of trade in was due to the competitive environment in tampons and lower sun care net sales due to unfavorable weather and lower pallet deals to warehouse clubs 
e 
marketing our advertising and promotion expenditures included in sg a for the past three years were in thousands twelve months ended december  december  december  total advertising and promotion    as a of net sales the above expenditures are primarily for television  radio and print advertising and production  as well as consumer promotions and market research 
we believe these expenditures support our brand building activities and are an investment in the longevity of our brands 
the increase in advertising and promotion as a percentage of net sales was due to our continued defense of our tampon franchise 
in addition to the advertising  consumer promotions and market research costs noted above  we routinely enter into other marketing efforts such as customer trade promotions and consumer coupons 
customer trade promotions include introductory marketing funds slotting fees  cooperative marketing programs  shelf price reductions on our products  advantageous end of aisle or in store displays  graphics and other trade promotion activities conducted by the customer 
costs for these trade promotions and consumer coupons are recorded as a reduction of sales and are not included as a component of advertising and promotion 
f 
competition the markets for our products are highly competitive and they are characterized by the frequent introduction of new products  often accompanied by major advertising and promotional programs 
we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  product differentiation and brand name recognition supported by advertising and promotional programs 
our competitors consist of a large number of domestic and foreign companies  many of which have significantly greater financial resources and less debt than we do 
we believe that the market for consumer packaged goods is very competitive and may intensify further in the future 
competitive pressures on our products may result from new competitors  new product initiatives by competitors  higher spending for advertising and promotion  and continued activity in the private label sector 
our infant care and feminine care businesses are particularly competitive 
we have faced heavy competition as new entrants have entered the market  including our cups  baby toiletries  pre moistened towelettes and diaper disposal categories 
in  the market share leader in the tampon category introduced a new plastic applicator tampon product supported with extensive advertising and promotion 
the competitive spending in the tampon category behind the launch of this new product throughout has led to a decline in our net sales and market share in tampons 
in each case  we are aggressively defending our market share positions through marketing programs and introducing innovative new products 
we feel we have stabilized our existing market shares given recent market share trends for playtex and our competitors

l 
customers and backlog no single customer or affiliated group of customers  except wal mart and target corporation target  accounted for over of our consolidated net sales in fiscal wal mart  our largest customer  and target  our second largest customer  represented approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales in fiscal our next three largest customers represented  in total  approximately of our total consolidated net sales in fiscal in fiscal  wal mart represented approximately of consolidated net sales and our next four largest customers represented  in total  approximately of consolidated net sales see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
in accordance with industry practice  we grant credit to our customers at the time of purchase 
in addition  we may grant extended payment terms to new customers and for the initial sale of introductory products and product line extensions 
we also may grant extended terms on our sun care products due to industry convention and the seasonal nature of this business  although payment on the specified due dates are not excused for any reason 
our practice is not to accept returned goods unless authorized by management of the sales organization 
returns result primarily from damage and shipping discrepancies 
exceptions to this policy include our sun care seasonal returns 
we allow customers to return sun care products that have not been sold by the end of the sun care season  which is normal practice in the sun care industry 
we record sales at the time the products are shipped and title transfers 
the terms of these sales vary but  in all instances  the following conditions are met the sales arrangement is evidenced by purchase orders submitted by customers  the selling price is fixed or determinable  product has been shipped and title transferred  there is an obligation to pay at a specified date or dates without any additional conditions or actions required by us  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
simultaneously with the time of the shipment  we reduce sales and cost of sales  and reserve amounts on our consolidated balance sheet for anticipated returns based upon an estimated return level  in accordance with gaap 
customers are required to pay for the sun care product purchased during the season under the required terms 
we offer a variety of extended terms options  due to the seasonal nature of sun care  for qualified customers 
in all cases  these extended terms require substantial cash payments prior to or during the summer sun care season 
we generally receive returns of our sun care products from september through march following the summer sun care season 
in  we initiated a more proactive approach to managing late season shipments to retailers 
the initiative is to better align our shipment patterns to retail consumption patterns during the sun care season 
we have continued this proactive process in with the objective of reducing costs associated with returns 
after our first full season of managing shipments and monitoring returns  we see reductions in the amount of returns and their associated handling costs see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations application of critical accounting policies of this annual report on form k for a more complete discussion on our policies regarding sun care revenue recognition 
because of the short period between order and shipment dates generally less than one month for most of our orders  the dollar amount of current backlog is not considered to be a reliable indication of future sales volume

employees and labor relations our worldwide workforce consisted of approximately  employees as of december   of whom approximately were located outside the united states  primarily in canada 
we believe that our labor relations are satisfactory and no material labor cost increases are anticipated in the near future 
none of our united states facilities had union representation at december  during  we completed the process of closing our watervliet  new york facility see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k which  prior to its closing  was our only unionized facility

risk factors our business is subject to certain risks  and we want you to review these risks while you are evaluating our business and our historical results 
please keep in mind  that any of the following risks discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report could materially and adversely affect us  our operating results  our financial condition and our projections and beliefs as to our future performance 
as such  our results could differ materially from those projected in our forward looking statements 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business 
in addition  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts and timing of revenue and expenses  the reported amounts and classification of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may vary from our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical results  assumptions that we make  as well as assumptions by third parties see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations application of critical accounting policies of this annual report on form k 
we face significant competition from other consumer products companies  many of which have significantly greater financial resources 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by the frequent introduction of new products  often accompanied by major advertising and promotional programs 
we believe that the market for consumer packaged goods will continue to be highly competitive and that the level of competition may intensify in the future 
our competitors consist of a large number of domestic and foreign companies  a number of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do and are not as highly leveraged as we are 
if we are unable to continue to introduce new and innovative products that are attractive to consumers  or are unable to allocate sufficient resources to effectively market and advertise our products so that they achieve widespread market acceptance  we may not be able to compete effectively and our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
our infant care and feminine care businesses are particularly competitive 
we have faced heavy competition as new competitors have entered the market  including our disposable feeding liners  cups  baby toiletries  pre moistened towelettes and diaper disposal categories 
in  the market share leader in the tampon category introduced a new plastic applicator tampon product supported with extensive advertising and promotion 
the competitive spending in the tampon category behind the launch of this product throughout has led to a decline in our net sales and market share in tampons 
although we believe that we have stabilized our existing market share in the tampon category  there can be no assurance that our market share will not deteriorate in the future 
sales of some of our products may suffer because of unfavorable weather conditions 
our businesses  especially sun care  may be negatively impacted by unfavorable weather conditions 
in accordance with industry practice  we allow customers to return unsold sun care products at the end of the season and these product returns are usually higher in years when the weather is unseasonably cool or wet 
this could adversely affect our business and operating results 
in  the sun care category declined as a result of bad weather 
we believe this impacted our ability to increase net sales in our sun care business in in addition  consumption of our feminine care and wet ones products may be affected by unfavorable weather  although to a lesser extent than the sun care business  due primarily to reduced levels of outdoor activities 
we may be adversely affected by the trend toward retail trade consolidation 
with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation  we are increasingly dependent upon key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing 
we may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers  such as inventory destocking  limitations on access to shelf space and other conditions 
we rely on a few large customers for a significant portion of our sales 
a few of our customers are material to our business and operations 
in fiscal  wal mart  our largest customer  and target  our second largest customer  represented approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
aggregate consolidated net sales to our next three largest customers represented approximately of our total consolidated net sales in fiscal the loss of sales to a large customer could materially and adversely affect us  our operating results  our financial condition and our projections and beliefs as to our future performance 
our earnings are impacted by our level of fixed operating costs 
our cost structure contains a certain level of fixed operating costs 
since all of our costs are not variable in nature  the volume of product manufactured impacts our overall cost per unit of product 
since our revenue is derived solely from the sale of products to our customers  a decrease in product sales  and the related reduction in units produced  may result in a higher cost per unit and a lower gross profit margin due to the impact of these fixed operating expenses 
we may incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 
acquisitions recorded as purchases for accounting purposes have resulted  and in the future may result  in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   we had million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets consisting primarily of trademarks  patents and other intellectual property 
we review these intangible assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
changes in the fair value of our businesses caused by various factors  some of which may be out of our control  may cause us to record impairment charges in the future 
we may not enter into a transaction associated with our decision to evaluate strategic alternatives 
on november   we announced our intention to undertake a process to evaluate strategic alternatives for maximizing shareholder value 
the strategic alternatives to be considered include  but are not limited to  business combinations with one or more parties to form a larger personal care and household products company  selling the entire company  divesting one or more lines of business and acquiring strategic lines of business 
there is no assurance this process will result in a transaction 
our initiatives to reduce costs may not materialize 
we have recently begun an operational restructuring to make operational improvements to increase effectiveness and profitability 
there is no assurance that we will achieve the expected results 
our acquisition strategy is subject to risks and may not be successful 
we consider the acquisition of other companies engaged in the manufacture and sale of consumer products 
at any given time  we may be in various stages of looking at these opportunities 
acquisitions are subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements and to other matters typical in acquisition transactions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify desirable acquisition candidates or will be successful in entering into definitive agreements relating to them 
even if definitive agreements are entered into  we cannot assure you that any future acquisition will be completed or that anticipated benefits of the acquisition will be realized 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties  may absorb significant management attention and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 
future acquisitions by us could result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities  which may have a negative effect on our operating results 
haas wheat controls a majority of our board of directors and its interests may conflict with yours 
haas wheat partners  lp haas wheat and its affiliates together hold approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock and will likely continue to exercise control over our business by virtue of their voting power with respect to the election of directors 
circumstances may occur in which the interests of haas wheat could be in conflict with your interests 
we may face liability associated with the use of products for which patent ownership or other intellectual property rights are claimed 
we may be subject to claims or inquiries regarding alleged unauthorized use of a third party s intellectual property 
an adverse outcome in any intellectual property litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others  require us to comply with injunctions to cease marketing or using certain products or brands  or require us to redesign  reengineer or rebrand certain products or packaging  any of which could affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are required to seek licenses under patents  trademarks or other intellectual property rights of others  we may not be able to acquire these licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  the cost of responding to an intellectual property infringement claim  in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources  whether or not the claim is valid  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 
while we believe that our patents  trademarks and other intellectual property have significant value  it is uncertain that this intellectual property  or any intellectual property acquired or developed by us in the future  will provide meaningful competitive advantages 
there can be no assurance that our patents or pending applications will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by competitors or that rights granted thereunder will provide meaningful proprietary protection 
moreover  competitors may infringe our patents or successfully avoid them through design innovation 
to combat infringement or unauthorized use  we may need to commence litigation  which can be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  in an infringement proceeding a court may decide that a patent  trademark or other intellectual property right of ours is not valid or is unenforceable  or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology or other intellectual property right at issue on the ground that it is non infringing 
policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to  or have the resources to  prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
risks relating to our indebtedness we have substantial debt  which could impair our financial condition 
our indebtedness at december  consisted of million in fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt 
as more fully described in notes  and to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  on february   we refinanced all of our indebtedness under our then existing credit facility and terminated our off balance sheet accounts receivable facility by issuing million of senior secured notes due the notes and entering into a new variable rate credit facility which is comprised of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility the refinancing transaction 
after this transaction  we continue to be highly leveraged and to have substantial debt service obligations 
also  we may incur additional debt in the future  subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to us  including our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest on our debt  which reduces the funds available to us for our operations  some of our debt is and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates  and our debt contains  and any refinancing of our debt likely will contain  restrictive covenants 
the failure to comply with these covenants may result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible  that any assets could be sold  or  if sold  of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales  or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
the terms of our new credit facility and our indentures may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 
our new credit facility and our indentures contain  and any future refinancing of our new credit facility and our indentures will likely contain  a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
our new credit facility and our indentures include restrictions and limitations on our ability to  among other things incur additional debt and contingent obligations  pay dividends and make restricted payments  make investments  loans and acquisitions  create liens  make payments on subordinated debt and modifications to subordinated debt  sell assets and subsidiary stock  enter into transactions with affiliates  and enter into certain mergers  consolidations and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets 
the restrictions and limitations in the new credit facility generally are more restrictive than those in our indentures 
a failure by us to comply with the covenants contained in our new credit facility or our indentures could result in an event of default  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results  our financial condition  and our liquidity 
a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in our new credit facility could lead to an event of default  which could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness under our new credit facility and could cause a cross default of other indebtedness 
a failure to comply with the restrictions in our indentures could result in an event of default under our indentures and could cause a cross default of other indebtedness 
we cannot assure you that our future operating results will be sufficient to enable compliance with the covenants in our new credit facility  our indentures or other indebtedness or to remedy any such default 
in addition  in the event of an acceleration  we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments

since these studies  numerous claims have been filed against all tampon manufacturers  a small percentage of which have been litigated to conclusion 
the number of tss claims relating to our tampons has declined substantially over the years 
during the mid s  there were approximately pending claims at any one time relating to our tampons 
as of the end of february  there were approximately seven pending claims 
additional claims  however  may be asserted in the future 
for tss claims filed from october  until november   we were self insured and bear the costs of defending those claims  including settlements and trials 
effective december   we obtained insurance coverage with certain limits in excess of the self insured retention of million per occurrence million in total  for claims occurring on or after december  effective december   we obtained insurance coverage with certain limits in excess of the self insured retention of million per claimant  for claims occurring on or after december  the incidence rate of menstrually associated tss has declined significantly over the years 
the number of confirmed menstrually related tss cases peaked in at  with deaths 
at that time  the united states center for disease control found that of women who developed the condition had been using a new brand of tampons 
that brand of product was removed from the market and the food and drug administration proposed regulations  which required all tampon manufacturers to provide tss warnings on their labeling 
in  the incidence of menstrually related tss was reported to be  with deaths 
it has continued to fall since then 
compared with the menstrual tss cases in  there were only three confirmed cases in and six in we believe that there are no claims or litigation pending against us  including the tss cases  which  individually or in the aggregate  would have a material effect on us 
this assessment is based on our experience with tss cases  the federally mandated warnings about tss our evaluation of the seven pending claims  on and in our tampon packages  and the reported decline in the incidence of development of case law upholding the menstrually associated tss  adequacy of tampon warnings that comply with federally mandated tss warnings 
in may  we received a favorable ruling in our false advertising lawsuit against procter gamble 
we had challenged the superiority advertising claims procter gamble utilized in support of the launch of its tampax pearl tampons 
in awarding us million in damages  payment of which has not been made by procter gamble pending its appeal  the jury found procter gamble s superiority claims for comfort  absorbency and protection to be false and misleading 
our company was granted a permanent injunction against procter gamble 
the order bars procter gamble from communicating that its tampax pearl tampons are superior in any way to those of playtex products 
the order requires procter gamble to recall from retailers and distributors  all offending promotional products  displays  as well as an immediate halt to all television and print advertising  packaging  direct mail  sales presentations and coupons making the claims 
procter gamble has appealed both decisions 
in a counterclaim  procter gamble had argued that we were falsely advertising that some of our tampons were so comfortable that you can t even feel them 
the jury rejected that claim 
we have joined a group of potentially responsible parties with respect to the kent county landfill site in houston  delaware  which has been designated a superfund site by the state of delaware 
based on the information currently available to us  the nature and quantity of material deposited by us and the number of other entities in the group  which are expected to share in the costs and expenses  we do not believe that our costs will be material 
we will share equally with the sara lee corporation all expenses and costs associated with our involvement with this site

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we periodically use financial instruments  such as derivatives  to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our variable rate debt and its effect on our earnings and cash flows 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for the sole purpose of trading for profit on price fluctuations  or to enter into contracts  which intentionally increase our underlying interest rate exposure 
as a result of the refinancing transaction on february  see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  our debt portfolio and interest rate profile has changed substantially 
our indebtedness at december  was comprised of million of senior subordinated notes due the notes and million of variable rate indebtedness at a weighted average interest rate of 
had the refinancing transaction occurred at december   we estimate our debt would have consisted of million of notes  million of notes and approximately million of variable rate indebtedness under the new credit facility 
as such  under our revised borrowing structure  a one percentage point change in our variable interest rate would not a have a material impact on our consolidated interest expense 
for the fiscal year ended december   we derived of net sales in currencies denominated other than the us dollar  of which was from our canadian subsidiary 
we conduct our international operations in a variety of countries and derive our sales in currencies including the euro  british pound  canadian dollar and australian dollar  as well as the us dollar 
our operations may be subject to volatility because of currency changes  inflation changes and changes in political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
in these countries  our sales and expenses are typically denominated in local currency  while costs of goods sold are denominated in a combination of local currency and the us dollar 
our results of operations are reported in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency rates can adversely affect our product prices  margins and operating costs as well as our reported results 
the vast majority of our products are manufactured in the us although we do source some finished goods  componentry and raw materials from overseas 
a weakening of the foreign currencies in which we generate sales relative to the currencies in which our costs are denominated  which is primarily the us dollar  may decrease our reported cash flows and operating profits 
our competitors may or may not be subject to the same fluctuations in currency rates  and our competitive position could be affected by these changes
