part i item business introduction pope talbot  inc the company is a pulp and wood products company  founded in  with headquarters in portland  oregon 
the company s primary operations are located in oregon  south dakota and british columbia  canada 
the company had  employees as of december  the company s common stock trades on the new york and pacific stock exchanges under the symbol pop 
the company developed as a lumber business based on timberland and facilities in the us pacific northwest  british columbia  canada and the black hills region of south dakota and wyoming 
in the late s  the company expanded into the pulp business with the purchase of the halsey  oregon pulp mill 
in  the company s board of directors and management focused the company s strategic direction exclusively on the pulp and lumber businesses 
the company had previously exited the disposable diaper business in  and in early sold its tissue business 
the company s small  million board foot sawmill in newcastle  wyoming was closed in as part of the company s effort to rationalize its black hills production facilities due to a reduction in public timber availability in that region 
through a number of purchases in and  the company acquired a percent ownership interest in harmac pacific inc harmac which operated a pulp mill located on the east coast of vancouver island at nanaimo  british columbia  canada 
on november   the company acquired the remaining minority interest in harmac and merged it into the company s canadian subsidiary  pope talbot ltd  in december during  the company continued its strategy of increasing and improving the company s position in the pulp business 
on june   the company acquired the mackenzie pulp mill  located in the northern interior of british columbia  canada  from norske skog canada 
the company s pulp business manufactures and sells northern bleached softwood kraft nbsk chip and sawdust pulp for use in the manufacture of newsprint  tissue  high grade coated and uncoated paper and construction materials 
the company s wood products business manufactures and sells standardized and specialty lumber  residual wood chips  and other by products 
pulp is sold globally  while lumber is sold primarily in the united states and canada 
pulp business the pulp business operates three pulp mills  located in halsey  oregon and nanaimo and mackenzie  british columbia  with approximately  metric tons of total annual capacity and the ability to offer customers a variety of pulp products 
halsey mill operations and fiber supply the halsey mill  with an annual capacity of approximately  metric tons  produces nbsk pulp that is sold in various forms to printing and writing paper  tissue  and newsprint manufacturers in the pacific northwest  asia  and european markets 
to make the mill compliant with the environmental protection agency s cluster rules  the company has made significant capital investments over the last five years  primarily related to its chlorine dioxide facility 
substantially all of the company s wood chip and sawdust requirements for the halsey pulp mill are satisfied through purchases from third parties 
the company has long term chip and sawdust supply arrangements or established supplier relationships with sawmills and veneer plants in the pacific northwest 
to provide an adequate supply of wood fiber for the mill  the company has expanded its capability of using sawdust as a raw material 
in  approximately percent of halsey s production was sawdust pulp 
additionally  the company continues to use an expanded geographic base to maintain an adequate supply of chips for the portion of the halsey pulp mill s production which is based on softwood chips 
the company believes that  based on existing wood chip and sawdust availability both within the willamette valley region of oregon and from other sources  fiber resources will be adequate for the company s requirements at the halsey pulp mill in the foreseeable future 
in conjunction with the fiber acquisition program for the halsey pulp mill  the company brokered wood chips for sale primarily into the export market until the first quarter of  when the company discontinued brokering wood chips 
the revenues related to wood chip brokering were reported in wood products revenues 
harmac mill operations and fiber supply with a current annual capacity of approximately  metric tons  the harmac mill is one of the largest producers of market pulp in canada  according to pricewaterhousecoopers llp s global market pulp survey of the harmac mill manufactures a wide range of high quality nbsk pulp made from custom blends of western hemlock  balsam  western red cedar and douglas fir 
the company has a long term fiber supply agreement for the harmac mill with weyerhaeuser company limited weyerhaeuser that provides for million cubic meters of fiber per year through  which represents approximately percent of harmac s fiber requirements 
under this contract  fiber is purchased at market prices  or at prices determined under a formula intended to reflect fair market value of the fiber  and which takes into account the net sales value of pulp sold by the harmac mill 
weyerhaeuser has agreed that it will supply  in addition to the minimum volumes to which it is committed under the long term fiber agreement  the fiber required to fulfill the balance of the harmac mill s operating requirements  provided that such fiber is available in the market without detriment to weyerhaeuser s own operations 
in addition  the company has entered into arrangements with other independent fiber suppliers to provide wood chips incremental to that provided by weyerhaeuser 
to a limited degree  the harmac mill also has the ability to acquire wood chips from the company s canadian sawmills 
harmac s chip conditioning system  completed in  consists of an industry standard set of chip thickness screens that separate oversized and undersized chip fragments and reprocesses the unacceptable wood chips to increase fiber quality and utilization 
mackenzie mill operations and fiber supply located in northern british columbia  the mackenzie pulp mill is known for producing a particularly fine grade of nbsk pulp from chips and sawdust 
a synergistic fit with the company s existing harmac and halsey pulp mills  the mackenzie facility provides the company the ability to offer customers additional types of products 
the mackenzie mill has an annual production capacity of  metric tons 
the company s mackenzie pulp mill purchased approximately percent of its fiber requirements in from sawmills also located in mackenzie  british columbia and operated by slocan forest products ltd 
slocan  primarily under long term  evergreen contracts 
under these contracts  fiber is purchased at market prices  or at prices determined under a formula intended to reflect the fair market value of the fiber  and which takes into account the net sales value of pulp sold by the mackenzie mill 
the company has entered into arrangements with other independent fiber suppliers to provide fiber incremental to that provided by slocan 
the company believes there is an abundance of fiber resources available within an economic radius of the mill that will be adequate for the mackenzie pulp mill s requirements 
marketing and distribution the company s pulp is marketed globally through sales offices in portland  oregon and brussels  belgium and through agency sales offices around the world 
in  approximately percent of the pulp segment s revenues were derived from sales to europe  percent to asia and percent to north america and other markets 
the company sold pulp products to numerous customers during  none of which accounted for more than percent of total revenues 
in  approximately percent of the company s pulp was sold to customers at market prices under long term or evergreen contracts  renewable each year 
approximately percent was sold to other repetitive customers without contract  with the balance sold on a spot basis 
by establishing and maintaining long term contractual relationships  the company is better able to forecast and regulate production 
backlog the company s pulp customers either enter into contracts for periods of one to three years or purchase pulp on a spot basis 
the contractual customers provide the company with annual estimates of their requirements  followed by periodic orders based on more definitive information 
at december   the company s backlog of orders believed to be firm for both contractual and non contractual customers was million compared with million at december  the backlog of pulp orders at year end represents orders which will be filled in the first quarter of the following year 
competition the pulp industry is highly competitive  with a substantial number of competitors having extensive financial resources  manufacturing expertise and sales and distribution organizations  many of which are larger than the company  but none of which is believed to be dominant 
canada and the nordic countries produce substantially more market pulp than they consume  with the surplus being sold in western europe  the united states and japan and other asian countries 
canada  finland  norway and sweden are the principal suppliers of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp to world markets 
the united states is a large exporter of hardwood and southern softwood pulp 
latin america also exports both hardwood and softwood pulp 
the principal methods of competition in the pulp market are price  quality  volume  reliability of supply and customer service 
the company s competitive advantages include the strength of its northern softwood fiber and the variety and consistent quality of the pulp it produces 
in addition  harmac has the operational flexibility provided by its three separate production lines in combination with the three principal species of fiber available in the region 
for further information regarding amounts of revenue  operating profit and loss and other financial information attributable to the pulp business  see item note  segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
wood products business the company s wood products business involves the manufacture and sale of dimension and board lumber 
the wood products business operates three sawmills in british columbia and one sawmill in the black hills region of south dakota  with total estimated annual capacity of million board feet 
wood chips and other materials obtained as a by product of the company s lumber operations are also sold 
during the last three years  revenues from lumber sales were approximately percent or more of total wood products revenues with the balance being wood chips  other residuals and logs 
logs  which are raw material for the company s wood products operations are obtained through long term cutting licenses on public lands  open log market purchases  competitive bidding from federal agencies and long term contracts on private lands 
approximately percent of the company s current lumber capacity is located in the black hills region of south dakota 
the company s spearfish  south dakota sawmill is the largest producer of lumber in south dakota 
the spearfish mill obtains its timber supply from both public and private lands in the black hills region and is also a participant in american forest and paper association s sustainable forestry initiative sfi program 
the mill produced million board feet of ponderosa pine lumber in of that volume  approximately percent was dimension lumber and the other percent was pine boards 
from the lumber  specialty products like exterior log cabin siding and interior paneling were produced 
in addition  a variety of specialized package sizes were available for wholesalers and retailers 
the spearfish sawmill also produces various by products such as wood chips  bark  sawdust and shavings that are sold to other manufacturers 
at the spearfish site  the company also operates the heartland wood pellet facility 
this facility produces wood pellets for wood pellet stoves and pet bedding and had sales of  tons of this product in in the black hills  the company obtained approximately percent of its timber requirements in from public sources under long term timber harvesting contracts  percent from private sources under long term harvesting contracts and percent was purchased in competitive open log markets 
approximately percent of the company s current lumber capacity is located in british columbia 
the canadian wood products division operates the midway  castlegar  and grand forks lumber mills in southern british columbia  as well as the arrow lakes and boundary timber forestry divisions 
castlegar is the company s largest sawmill  offering a broad mix of western canadian species in various widths and lengths up to feet 
the grand forks and midway mills are significant producers of machine stress rated msr lumber 
approximately percent of the timber requirements for the canadian mills in was obtained from the provincial government of british columbia under long term cutting licenses on million acres of public lands with the remaining percent purchased in competitive open log markets 
approximately percent of all timberlands in british columbia are owned by the province of british columbia and administered by the ministry of forests 
a stumpage charge is assessed by the province of british columbia on all government timber that is harvested 
the base stumpage rate charged is determined to meet revenue targets set by the provincial government 
the base rate is adjusted quarterly by the ministry of forests for various factors including recent lumber prices  timber quality  harvesting costs and species mix 
a market based timber pricing system is expected to be introduced in the british columbia interior in it is not known when that change will be implemented  or how it will affect the stumpage paid by the companies canadian lumber operations 
the forest act empowers the ministry of forests to grant timber tenures  including tree farm licenses tfls  forest licenses fls and timber licenses 
the annual allocable cut aac for timber tenures is determined by the ministry of forests on a sustained yield basis and reflects timber conditions  regional and local economic and social interests  and environmental considerations 
the actual cut from a tfl or fl for any given year may vary from zero to percent of the designated aac for the tenure as long as the annual average cut over a five year prescribed period is within percent of the designated aac for that period 
a tfl is an area based tenure granted for a term of years that is generally replaced every five years for a further year term  subject to satisfactory performance by the licensee of its forest management obligations as determined by the ministry of forests 
approximately percent of the company s aac in was derived from two tfls tfl and tfl covering million acres of timberland 
tfls are considered the most secure form of timber tenure 
the company s two tfls were both replaced effective march  with year terms 
provincial government timberlands that are not designated as tfls are organized into timber supply areas tsas 
fls are issued within each tsa with the overall harvest for the tsa managed by the ministry of forests on a sustained yield basis 
fls are volume based tenures which authorize a specified volume of timber to be cut within a specific tsa 
fls have a term of years and are generally replaceable every five to years for a further year term  subject to satisfactory performance by the licensee of its forest management obligations as determined by the ministry of forests 
the company has one fl located in the boundary tsa that provided approximately percent of the company s aac in the company s fl  covering a total of million acres  was replaced on december  for a year term 
the company is in compliance in all material respects with the terms of its forest tenures 
provincial legislation requires the chief forester for british columbia to review sustainable timber harvesting levels in each tfl and tsa in the province generally every five years 
such determinations involve the company s fl and two tfls 
the annual allowable cut for tfl was increased percent in as a result of the chief forester s timber supply review 
in march  the government of british columbia crown introduced the forestry revitalization plan the plan that provides for significant changes to crown forest policy and to the existing allocation of crown timber tenures to licensees 
the changes prescribed in the plan include the elimination of minimum cut control regulations  the elimination of existing timber processing regulations  and the elimination of restrictions limiting the transfer and subdivision of existing licenses 
in addition  the crown has legislated that licensees  including the company  will be required to return percent of their replaceable tenure to the crown 
because the first  cubic meters of aac are not subject to reduction  the timber take back is expected to result in a reduction of approximately  cubic meters  or percent  of the company s existing annual allowable cut 
the plan states that approximately half of this volume will be redistributed to open up opportunities for woodlots  community forests and first nations  and the other half will be available for public auction 
the crown has stated that licensees will be fairly compensated for lost harvesting rights and improvements on crown land  such as roads and bridges  based on the remaining term of the license and calculated according to a regulation that has not yet been enacted 
the minister of forests has three years from march  to determine reductions to a licensee s aac 
in addition  a market based timber pricing system is expected to be introduced in the british columbia interior in it is not known when that change will be implemented  or how it will affect the stumpage paid by the company s canadian lumber operations 
the effect  if any  on the company s future supply and cost of logs  chips and sawdust to its canadian operations cannot be determined at this time 
the british columbia government implemented its forest practices code code that became fully effective in mid the code governs all facets of a company s forest management activities from planning through harvesting and forest renewal and provides a uniform set of rules that are designed to better secure the long term sustainability of the forest industry 
the company s harvesting practices are in compliance with the standards set out in the code 
the company s canadian forest operations implemented an environmental management system in and received certification under iso  which is an international standard for environmental systems 
this system offers third party verification that the company is committed to environmental protection of its operating areas  as well as the continual improvement of its performance with regard to the environment 
furthermore  in  the company s canadian forest operations  as the result of a rigorous third party audit  were certified that the company is meeting all of the requirements of the american forest paper association s af pa sustainable forestry initiative sfi program 
the standard includes a land stewardship ethic that integrates the managing  growing  nurturing  harvesting and reforesting and replanting of trees with the conservation of soil  air and water quality  wildlife and fish habitat and aesthetics 
support for and conformity to the sfi program is mandatory for af pa member companies 
the company s canadian forest operations are carried out on public forestlands that are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or common law rights of the first nations people of canada 
most of the lands in british columbia are not covered by treaties and  as a result  the claims of british columbia s first nations people relating to these forest resources are largely unresolved 
to address these claims  the governments of canada and british columbia instituted a negotiation process under the administration of a treaty commission 
any settlements that may result from the negotiation process may involve a combination of cash and resources and grants of conditional rights to gather food on public lands and some rights of self government 
the effect of any treaties on timber tenure rights  including the company s timber tenures  cannot be estimated at this time 
such claims may  in the future  result in a decrease in the lands available for forest operations under british columbia licenses  including the company s licenses and contracts  additional restrictions on the sale and harvest of timber on british columbia timberlands  and an increase in operating costs 
such claims could also affect timber supply and prices 
the company believes that such claims will not have a significant effect on the company s timber availability in year  although they may have such an effect in the future 
canada us trade issues approximately percent of the company s current lumber capacity is located in british columbia  canada 
between april and april  exporters of softwood lumber from canada to the us were subject to tariffs on lumber volumes in excess of defined tariff free volumes under the canada us softwood lumber agreement sla 
upon expiration of the sla on april   petitions for the imposition of antidumping duties add and countervailing duties cvd on softwood lumber from canada were filed with the us department of commerce doc and the us international trade commission itc  by certain us industry and trade groups 
in response to the petitions  the itc conducted a preliminary injury investigation and  in may  determined that there was a reasonable indication that the lumber industry in the united states was threatened with material injury by reason of softwood lumber imports from canada 
in august  the doc issued its preliminary determination on the cvd and imposed a preliminary duty rate of percent to be posted by cash deposits or bonds on sales of softwood lumber to the us on or after august  the doc also made a preliminary determination that certain circumstances existed which would have resulted in duties on sales of softwood lumber applying retroactively to may  critical circumstances 
the preliminary duty rate of percent was suspended on december   days after the preliminary determination  in accordance with us law 
in october  the doc issued its preliminary determination on the add and imposed a company specific preliminary duty rate on six companies reviewed ranging from percent to percent 
all other companies  including pope talbot s canadian subsidiary  received the weighted average rate of the six companies of percent 
the preliminary add rate applied to all shipments of softwood lumber made to the us on or after november  the doc did not find critical circumstances in its preliminary add ruling and  therefore  did not assess those duties retroactively 
in march  the doc announced revised import duty rates of percent and percent  respectively in the cvd and add cases 
the doc also determined that there would be no retroactive application of the cvd prior to august  in may  the itc finalized its ruling on the imposition of add and cvd on softwood lumber from canada  and based on the doc s final determination of add and cvd rates  the company is currently subject to a combined import duty rate of percent  effective may  the company s results included duty costs of million 
based on the lumber import duty rates in effect at the time and the impact of doc s actions with respect to duty rates and time period applicability  the company s results included the positive impact of a net reversal of million lumber import duties accrued 
duties accrued and expensed in were million 
in june  and annually thereafter for a total of five years  the doc began conducting administrative reviews to determine whether canada continued to subsidize softwood logs and whether the canadian companies  including the company s canadian subsidiary  engaged in dumping and  if so  the appropriate adjustments to cvd and add rates to be applied retroactively to the company for imports during the period of review 
with respect to the company s payments of add during the period of administrative review  the company may receive a refund of some or all of the add paid if the companies specifically reviewed are finally determined to have a weighted average dumping rate less than the rate paid by the company 
if  in the administrative review  the companies specifically reviewed are finally determined to have a weighted average dumping rate greater than the rate paid by the company  the company may be required to pay add in the amount of the difference 
with respect to the company s payment of cvd during the period of administrative review  the company may receive a refund of some or all of the cvd paid if the cvd rate paid by the company is greater than the cvd rate finally determined in the administrative review of subsidies during the period of review 
if  in the administrative review of subsidies during the period of review  the cvd rate is finally determined to be greater than the cvd rate paid by the company  the company may be required to pay cvd in the amount of the difference 
as of this time  the company has no way to determine whether administrative reviews will increase or decrease the amount of add and cvd required to be deposited 
beginning in the second quarter of  both the cvd and add orders will be automatically reviewed in a sunset proceeding to determine whether dumping or a countervailing subsidy would be likely to continue or recur 
in september  nafta indicated the itc s determination on threat of material injury in the future as a result of the expiration of the softwood lumber agreement was not properly supported by substantial written evidence and returned the case to the itc  ordering it to re evaluate the evidence and issue a new determination 
the doc issued an amended determination to the nafta panel on january   revising its methodology and reducing the cvd rate to percent from percent 
there can be no certainty that this new methodology and rate calculation will be accepted by the nafta panel or that the doc will not appeal the original nafta panel ruling 
in addition  the doc s response to prior rulings has led to the recalculation of antidumping duties  with a slight decrease to the company s add rate 
the company continues to make cash deposits at the percent rate 
on january   the canadian provincial governments announced their opposition to a proposal developed by the canadian and us federal governments to end the assessment of tariffs on canadian lumber imports 
the proposal would have dropped the tariffs in exchange for a quota system that would have reduced canada s access to the us lumber market from current levels 
various nafta and wto rulings have been issued to date  and several of these rulings are subject to further appeals 
in the event that final rates differ from the depository rates  ultimate costs may be higher or lower than those recorded to date 
the ultimate outcome or effect of nafta and wto reviews  or whether a settlement between the canadian and us governments may be reached  cannot be predicted 
marketing and distribution in  approximately percent of the company s lumber products were sold to wholesalers  with the remainder sold to remanufacturers and other suppliers of building materials 
wood chips produced by the company s sawmills are sold to manufacturers of pulp in the us and canada 
acquired logs which are not suitable for consumption approximately four percent of logs acquired in were sold to other canadian forest products companies 
marketing of the company s wood products is centralized in its portland  oregon office 
although the company does not have distribution facilities at the retail level  the company does utilize several reload facilities around the us to assist in moving the product closer to the customer 
the company sold wood products to numerous customers during  none of which accounted for more than percent of total revenues 
backlog the company normally maintains four to six weeks of lumber inventory 
at december   orders were approximately million compared with approximately million at december  this backlog represented an order file for the company that generally would be shipped within approximately one month 
competition the wood products industry is highly competitive  with a large number of companies producing products that are reasonably standardized 
there are numerous competitors of the company that are of comparable size or larger  none of which is believed to be dominant 
the principal means of competition in the company s wood products business are pricing and the ability to satisfy customer demands for various types and grades of lumber 
for further information regarding amounts of revenue  operating profit and other financial information attributable to the wood products business  see item note  segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  provincial and local air  water and land pollution control  solid and hazardous waste management  disposal and remediation laws and regulations in all areas where it has operations 
compliance with these laws and regulations generally requires operating costs as well as capital expenditures 
it is difficult to estimate the costs related solely to environmental matters of many capital projects which have been completed in the past or which may be required in the future 
changes required to comply with environmental standards will affect other areas such as facility life and capacity  production costs  changes in raw material requirements and costs and product value 
the company s estimates of future environmental compliance expenditures are based on its understanding of current standards 
however  the ultimate outcome of future compliance is uncertain due to various factors such as the interpretation of environmental laws  potential introduction of new environmental laws and evolving technologies 
in april  the environmental protection agency epa published regulations establishing standards and limitations for non combustion sources under the clean air act and revised regulations under the clean water act  collectively referred to as the cluster rules 
the company s exposure to these regulations relates to the company s halsey pulp mill 
compliance with certain portions of the cluster rules was required in and  with other portions not required until the cost of the upgrade of the halsey mill required to comply with the first two portions of the cluster rules totaled million 
the epa has also promulgated maximum achievable control technology mact requirements for pulp mill combustion sources which require installation of modified particulate emission control equipment by the installation of this equipment was completed at the halsey mill in at a cost of million 
the company currently estimates the cost of compliance with the portion of the cluster rules that becomes effective in at million 
the epa has also proposed rules for industrial boiler combustion mact requirements that are expected to be promulgated in  with compliance required in these rules could potentially affect the company s spearfish south dakota sawmill where such a boiler is operated 
after the rules for power boiler generating facilities are finalized  the company will be able to reasonably estimate the capital expenditures necessary for compliance 
the major environmental issues for pulp producers in british columbia are the management of wastewater  air emissions and solid waste in compliance with an extensive body of applicable environmental protection laws and regulations 
the harmac and mackenzie mills have comprehensive environmental management programs in place  including modern pollution abatement and control technologies  detailed operating procedures and practices  early warning systems  scheduled equipment inspections and emergency response planning 
regular independent audits ensure that the environmental programs are being implemented effectively and that all regulated requirements are being met 
the canadian operations are subject to particulate emission standards determined by the british columbia ministry of water  land and air protection 
the company performed a feasibility study in at the mackenzie pulp mill to determine the appropriate control devices and equipment configuration necessary to reduce particulate emissions from the mill s power boiler 
costs incurred in  primarily for the feasibility study  were million 
the estimated remaining costs are expected to be incurred as follows million and million 
legislation has been enacted in british columbia governing the review of operating sites for potential contamination 
if a triggering event occurs in respect of any property that has been used for industrial or commercial purposes the regulations require  among other things  a site profile to be prepared in order to determine whether the site in question is potentially contaminated  in which case remediation may be required under government supervision 
pulp mills are subject to these regulations and past and present owners or operators of mill sites may face remediation costs if contaminated areas are found 
triggering events include the sale of the property or the decommissioning of the mill 
the company cannot assess the magnitude of costs it may be required to incur in the future in order to comply with this legislation if a triggering event should occur 
the canadian federal species at risk act sara was enacted in to provide protective measures in canada for species identified as being at risk and for critical habitat 
the first two transitional phases were introduced in  identifying wildlife included in the sara listing and establishing the timeline for recovery strategies to be prepared 
the third phase  effective june   covers the sara prohibitions  including critical habitat protection and enforcement of the law 
prohibited activity includes damage or destruction of the residences of any listed endangered or threatened species  or a listed extirpated species if a recovery strategy has recommended its reintroduction into the wild 
it is not known what additional restrictions on timber harvests or other forest management practices  increases in operating costs or affect on timber supply and prices will result from implementation of this act 
in british columbia  the company s forest resources and related logging activities and reforestation responsibilities have been affected by governmental actions over the past several years

includes sales volume since mackenzie acquisition on june  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company experienced an improvement in the market prices for pulp and lumber during  but continued to be burdened by the effect of import duties on canadian softwood lumber as well as a weakening us dollar  which increased reported pulp and wood products manufacturing costs  which are incurred primarily in canadian dollars 
the company s productivity and sales price improvements in were completely offset by the effects of these two factors 
the company lost million in on revenues of million  compared with a net loss of million in on revenues of million and a net loss of million in on revenues of million 
basic and diluted losses per share were for  for and for the following issues have significantly affected the company s recent operating results  and are expected to continue to affect the company 
fees on lumber imports into the united states with approximately percent of the company s current lumber capacity located in british columbia  the contentious issues surrounding the importation of softwood lumber from canada into the us have had a significant impact on the results of operations and cash flows from the company s wood products business 
during the five year period ending march   the company conducted business under the quota based canada us softwood lumber agreement 
shortly after expiration of that agreement  the department of commerce instituted countervailing and anti dumping duties on softwood lumber produced by the company s canadian mills and imported into the us see us trade issues in the wood products business section of item  business 
the impact of these duties  and the subsequent adjustments to the duty rates and their respective applicable periods  has caused the reported results of operations and cash flows from the wood products business to fluctuate dramatically 
cash deposits of duties began in may  and the company paid million and million in and  respectively  and expects to pay approximately million to million in the ultimate outcome of the legal challenges to these duties cannot be predicted  but the elimination of the duties could materially improve the wood products business financial results 
exchange rate fluctuations the majority of the company s pulp and wood products businesses are managed within the company s canadian subsidiaries 
while pulp and lumber sales are made primarily in us dollars  the vast majority of the canadian subsidiaries expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
while relatively stable relative to the canadian dollar during the years and  the us dollar significantly weakened against many foreign currencies in  including a decline of approximately percent against the canadian dollar 
the company estimates that the change in the us to canadian dollar exchange rate from to increased cost of goods by approximately million 
the company manages a portion of its exposure to the effects of a fluctuating currency exchange rate between the us and canadian dollar by using foreign exchange contracts  but historically has not entered into material currency rate hedges with respect to exposure from its operations in canada 
cyclical product pricing one of the most significant factors in the company s financial performance is the price it receives for its products 
the company s pulp products are sold primarily in europe  north america and asia  and prices are affected by many factors such as global economic conditions  producer inventory levels  existing and future production capacity and currency fluctuations 
the to period was affected significantly by poor global economic conditions that led to a weakening demand for pulp 
in the second half of  improved economic conditions  a weakening us dollar  relatively balanced nbsk producer inventory levels and an increase in pulp consumption by china led to a steady rise in pulp sales prices through the end of the year 
the company anticipates that stronger world wide economic activity in will lead to higher paper consumption and  therefore  higher demand and prices for the company s pulp products 
list prices for nbsk pulp delivered into northern europe in real terms  as indicated in the graph below  were at historical lows during the to periods 
the following chart illustrates the annual average gross real prices of nbsk pulp for the last years logo source resource information systems  inc delivered northern europe 
nominal prices indexed to based on us producer price finished goods index 
lumber prices during the last three years have also been near cyclical lows 
prices for the company s lumber products  sold primarily in the us  are affected by factors such as the general economic climate in the us  the level of interest rates  the rate of housing starts and level of remodeling activity in the us  and production capacity relative to demand in the lumber industry 
the company has continued a program of focusing on value added products which obtain premium prices in the market for lumber products 
despite record levels of housing starts in the us during the to periods  lumber prices during those periods were near cyclical lows due primarily to excess lumber production capacity in north america and  until recently  a relatively strong us dollar 
the company expects the pickup in us economic growth that occurred in the second half of to continue into increasing economic activity could lead to an increase in interest rates sometime in  though interest rates in were at historically low levels 
higher interest rates could lead to reduction in the rate of housing starts and the level of repair and remodeling activity 
reductions in housing starts and the level of repair and remodeling activity generally reduce demand for lumber products

nominal prices indexed to based on us producer price finished goods index 
the company expects to benefit significantly from potential future price increases  as its earnings are highly leveraged to pulp and lumber prices 
for example  assuming other costs remain constant  using s production of approximately  metric tons of pulp  a per metric ton price improvement would result in additional annual pre tax income of approximately million 
similarly  using s lumber production of approximately  thousand board feet and assuming other costs remain constant  a per thousand board feet price improvement would result in additional annual pre duty and pre tax income of approximately million 
in the early months of the first quarter of  both pulp and lumber prices have increased over fourth quarter levels 
financial leverage the company s long term debt to total capitalization was percent at december   higher than the company s targeted level of percent 
over the last few years  the company has extended the maturity dates of a significant portion of its debt  with approximately one half of total long term debt at december  due in the company expects to meet its cash requirements for with cash generated from operations and credit facilities 
net cash provided by operations is expected to increase significantly in due to the improving price outlook for the company s products 
any excess cash generated from operations is expected to be used for debt reduction 
the company s bank lines at december  expire in  and the company expects to extend or replace the lines in equal or greater amounts of borrowing capacity 
to reduce working capital and increase its liquidity  the company entered into an accounts receivable purchase agreement with a financial institution in the fourth quarter of  under which the company can sell up to million of qualifying accounts receivable on a revolving basis 
the company had million of such receivables sold at the end of continued reductions in working capital levels and disciplined capital spending are additional measures the company is using to improve liquidity 
based on market conditions in the future  the company may  at its discretion  issue equity securities to decrease its financial leverage 
cost reduction measures the company continues to focus on efforts to improve its cost structure through targeted cost reduction programs and disciplined capital spending 
in the pulp business  subsequent to the acquisition of the harmac and mackenzie mills  the company has centralized all sales  corporate and information systems functions 
in  as measured in canadian dollars for the canadian pulp mills  the favorable impact of lower man hours per ton of pulp production was offset by higher fiber and energy costs 
in the wood products business  excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and lumber import duties  cost of lumber sold per thousand board feet decreased in compared with logs utilized per thousand board feet of lumber produced has decreased since  reflecting the company s continuing investment in modern sawmilling technology

the company s inventory levels at december  were approximately days of shipments 
the average cost per metric ton of pulp sold in increased eight percent compared with a significant factor affecting pulp cost of sales is the average exchange rate used to translate operating costs of the company s canadian pulp mills from canadian dollars to us dollars 
the value of the us dollar declined significantly in  and the company estimates that the decrease in the average daily us to canadian dollar exchange rate from to resulted in an approximately million increase in pulp cost of sales  and an eight percent increase in the average cost per metric ton of pulp sold in wood products revenues from the company s wood products business totaled million in compared with million in  a nine percent increase

in  wood products experienced no significant down time 
the average cost per thousand board feet of lumber sold was percent higher in compared with the change in the amount of lumber import duties included in cost of sales from to increased the average cost per thousand board feet of lumber sold in by percent

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in item note  accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company s management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
the company has identified certain accounting policies  described below  that are the most important to the portrayal of the company s current financial condition and results of operations 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company periodically evaluates its tax assets and liabilities and adjusts these balances as appropriate 
it believes that its tax provision is adequate based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law 
the company believes that it will have sufficient future us taxable income to make it more likely than not that the net operating loss deferred tax asset will be realized 
in making this assessment  the company has considered the ability to utilize certain tax planning strategies to generate sufficient taxable income in the us to fully utilize net operating loss carryforwards that might otherwise expire 
the realization of the deferred tax asset is not assured and could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or the estimated benefits realizable from tax planning strategies are reduced 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review of recoverability  the company estimates future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
the key assumptions in estimating these cash flows are future pricing of commodity products and future estimates of expenses to be incurred 
the assumptions regarding pricing are based on near term price projections and  for the longer term  based on average pricing over the commodity cycle due to the inherent volatility of commodity pricing 
these prices are estimated from information gathered from industry research firms  research reports published by investment analysts and other published forecasts 
the company s estimates of future expenses is based on internal planning models and the expectation that the company will generally continue to reduce production costs that will offset the effects of inflation 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for its employees 
the company uses a september measurement date for plan assets and liabilities 
key assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded in the company s financial statements include the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  anticipated trends in health care costs  assumed increases in salaries  mortality rates and other factors 
the company s discount rate assumption is based on the rates of return on high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with projected future plan cash flows 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected average rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan s investment portfolios 
these assumptions are reviewed with external actuaries annually on the plan measurement date and are updated as appropriate 
actual experience that differs from the assumptions could have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
at december   the company had a prepaid pension cost asset of million related to its us pension plan 
at september   the fair value of us pension plan assets exceeded the company s accumulated benefit obligation abo 
if the fair value of plan assets were to fall below the plan s calculated abo and the company chose not to make a cash contribution to plan assets at least equal to the difference between the abo and the fair value of plan assets  this prepaid pension cost asset would be written off  net of taxes  by a direct charge to shareholders equity  with no impact on earnings or cash 
the most significant variables that could cause this to occur are the actual return on plan assets and the discount rate used on the measurement date to value plan liabilities 
the company used a discount rate of percent for its us pension plan liabilities at september  had the company used a discount rate of percent and the company chose not to make a cash contribution to the plan prior to the measurement date in an amount at least equal to the difference between the abo and the fair value of plan assets  the us plan assets would have been below the plan s calculated abo 
at september   the company reduced its expected rate of return used for its canadian plans  with the weighted average rate of return on plan assets for us and canadian plans decreasing to percent from percent at september  each percent reduction in the expected return on assets is expected to increase estimated pension expense by approximately million 
at september   the company also reduced the discount rate used for its us and canadian plans  with the weighted average discount rate decreasing to percent from percent at september  pension and postretirement benefit costs for will be based on the percent assumed discount rate 
based on estimated expenses  each percent reduction in the assumed discount rate is expected to increase pension and postretirement benefit costs by approximately million 
environmental matters the company is required to make estimates of the costs of remediation for certain contaminated former and currently operated mill sites and landfills 
the ultimate costs to the company for the investigation  remediation and monitoring of these sites cannot be predicted with certainty due to the often unknown magnitude of the pollution or the necessary cleanup  the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods  the amount of time necessary to accomplish such cleanups and the evolving nature of cleanup technologies and governmental regulations 
the company has recognized liabilities for environmental remediation costs for these sites in amounts that it believes are probable and reasonably estimable 
when one estimate within the range of estimated costs is better than another  the company accrues that amount  otherwise the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
in making these judgments and assumptions  the company considers  among other things  the activity to date at particular sites and information obtained through consultation with applicable regulatory authorities and third party consultants and contractors 
the company has also considered the obligation or willingness and ability of third parties to bear an allocated or proportionate share of the cost of these activities 
the company regularly monitors its exposure to environmental loss contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  it is at least reasonably possible that a change in the estimated liabilities accrued will occur in the near future 
reforestation approximately percent of the company s current lumber capacity is located in the canadian province of british columbia 
the company primarily obtains its timber from the provincial government of british columbia under timber harvesting licenses 
under these licenses  the company is responsible for all reforestation costs such as site preparation  planting  fertilizing  thinning and herbicide application until the harvested land requires no further reforestation activity prior to the next harvest 
the company estimates reforestation costs based on its substantial experience in reforestation in british columbia under the province s forest practice code 
a significant portion of the reforestation costs occur during the first five years after harvest 
the remaining costs are incurred until the harvested land is free to grow  generally seven to twelve years after initial planting 
whereas it is possible to reasonably estimate the costs of labor and materials required for reforestation activities  it is not possible to predict the impact of natural disasters  such as windstorms  droughts and forest fires  or the possibility of changes in the province s regulations 
the liability for reforestation costs is recorded at fair value 
this requires the company to  in addition to projecting future cash expenditures  anticipate the effects of inflation and use an appropriate discount rate in the calculation of the liability 
the fair value of this liability will be adjusted in the future as anticipated cash expenditures  inflation and discount rates fluctuate 
due to the numerous variables relating to the determination of this liability at its fair value  the estimate is subject to a level of uncertainty  and as additional information becomes known  the estimate may change 
stock based compensation the company has chosen to continue to use the intrinsic value method under the accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees under which no compensation cost is recognized for stock options granted at or above fair market value 
under this method  no compensation expense related to stock options has been recognized in the statement of operations for the periods presented 
as permitted under the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation  the company provides the pro forma disclosures as if the company had adopted the fair value based method for all stock based compensation in item note  net income loss per share 
had compensation expense for the stock based compensation plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant dates under those plans consistent with sfas no 
 the company s net loss would have been greater 
cautionary language regarding forward looking statements statements in this report that are not reported financial results or other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on present information the company has related to its existing business circumstances and involve a number of business risks and uncertainties  any of which could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements 
further  investors are cautioned that the company does not assume any obligation to update forward looking statements based on unanticipated events or changed expectations 
in addition to specific factors that may be described in connection with any particular forward looking statement  factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include but are not limited to cyclical operating results and product pricing the company s financial performance depends primarily on the prices it receives for its products 
prices for both pulp and lumber products are highly cyclical and have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
increases or decreases in production capacity  increases or decreases in operating rates and changes in customer consumption patterns will cause changes in product prices 
the economic climate of each region where the company s products are sold has a significant impact on the demand  and therefore the prices  for pulp and lumber 
changes in regional economies can cause fluctuation in prices and sales volumes and  as a result  directly affect the company s profitability and cash flows 
the continued uncertainties in the economic conditions of the united states and other international markets could adversely affect the company s results of operations and cash flows 
any future downward fluctuation in prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the amount of downtime that the company s mills take fluctuates based on changes in pricing and demand for its products 
competitive markets the company s products are sold primarily in the united states  europe  canada and asia 
the markets for the company s products are highly competitive on a global basis  with a number of major companies competing in each market with no company holding a dominant position 
for both lumber and pulp  a large number of companies produce products that are reasonably standardized  therefore  the traditional basis for competition has been price 
other competitive factors are quality of product  reliability of supply and customer service 
because of greater resources  many of the company s competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to industrial changes or devote greater resources to the sale of the products 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to compete successfully against such competitors 
exchange rate fluctuations although the company s sales are made primarily in us dollars  a substantial portion of its operating costs and expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
significant variations in relative currency values  particularly a significant increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar  could adversely affect the company s results of operations and cash flows 
a substantial portion of the company s pulp customer base is in europe  asia and other non us markets 
as such  the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies directly affects the company s customers ability to pay and the company s relative competitive cost position with other regions pulps 
any significant exchange rate fluctuation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
for example  a change in the us to canadian dollar translation rate from to would increase pre tax cost of sales as measured in us dollars by an estimated million us on an annual basis 
fees on lumber imports into the united states in may  the itc imposed duties on certain types of softwood lumber imported into the united states from canada after determining that imports of certain types of softwood lumber from canada threatened us softwood lumber mill operators 
based on findings of the doc regarding subsidies and dumping margins  the itc s decision subjects the company s imports of certain types of softwood lumber from canada on or after may  to a total duty rate of percent  which has had a material adverse effect on the wood products business result of operations 
various nafta and wto rulings have been issued to date  and several of these rulings are subject to further appeals 
in the event that final rates differ from the depository rates  ultimate costs may be higher or lower than those recorded to date 
the ultimate outcome or effect of nafta and wto reviews  or whether a settlement between the canadian and us governments may be reached  cannot be predicted 
environmental regulations the company s pulp and lumber operations are subject to a variety of national and local laws and regulations  many of which deal with the environment 
these laws and regulations impose stringent standards on the company s operations regarding  among other things  air emissions  water discharges  use and handling of hazardous materials  use  handling and disposal of waste and remediation of environmental contamination 
changes in these laws or regulations have in the past  and could in the future  require the company to make substantial expenditures in order to comply  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
environmental liabilities the company is currently participating in the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at three sites on which it previously conducted business 
in addition  the company is working with the ministry of water  land and air protection in british columbia regarding environmental contamination at the mackenzie mill 
the company may also be required to investigate and remediate environmental conditions at other sites if contamination  presently unknown to the company  is discovered 
the ultimate cost to the company for site remediation and monitoring of these sites cannot be predicted with certainty due to the difficulties in estimating the ultimate cost of remediation and determining the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties 
expenditures that may be required in connection with these sites could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
availability and pricing of raw materials logs  wood chips and sawdust  the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products  are purchased in highly competitive  price sensitive markets 
these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality 
supply and price of these raw materials are dependent upon a variety of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
changes in the pricing of logs under british columbia s current stumpage system as the result of negotiations to resolve the us canada lumber import duty issue could affect the cost of logs for our canadian sawmills 
other factors include changing environmental and conservation regulations and natural disasters  such as forest fires  wind storms or other extreme weather conditions 
a decrease in the supply of logs  wood chips and sawdust can cause higher raw material costs and  as a result  material fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
the company s harmac pulp mill has a long term fiber supply agreement with weyerhaeuser that provides for million cubic meters of fiber per year through the company s mackenzie pulp mill purchases approximately percent of its fiber requirements from sawmills also located in mackenzie  british columbia and operated by slocan 
fiber is purchased at market or at prices determined under a formula intended to reflect market value of the fiber 
the failure by weyerhaeuser or slocan to produce the required fiber pursuant to these contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company as a whole 
the company has entered into arrangements with other independent fiber suppliers to provide fiber incremental to that provided by weyerhaeuser and slocan 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of softwood fiber for its pulp operations 
the forestry revitalization plan in march  the government of british columbia crown introduced the forestry revitalization plan the plan that provides for significant changes to crown forest policy and to the existing allocation of crown timber tenures to licensees 
the changes prescribed in the plan include the elimination of minimum cut control regulations  the elimination of existing timber processing regulations  and the elimination of restrictions limiting the transfer and subdivision of existing licenses 
in addition  the crown has legislated that licensees  including the company  will be required to return percent of their replaceable tenure to the crown 
because the first  cubic meters of aac are not subject to reduction  the timber take back is expected to result in a reduction of approximately  cubic meters  or percent  of the company s existing annual allowable cut 
the crown has stated that licensees will be fairly compensated for lost harvesting rights and improvements on crown land  such as roads and bridges  based on the remaining term of the license and calculated according to a regulation that has not yet been enacted 
the minister of forests has three years from march  to determine reductions to a licensee s aac 
in addition  a market based timber pricing system is expected to be introduced in the british columbia interior in it is not known when that change will be implemented  or how it will affect the stumpage paid by the company s canadian lumber operations 
the effect  if any  on the company s future supply and cost of logs  chips and sawdust to its canadian operations cannot be determined at this time 
net operating loss tax asset management believes that the company will have sufficient future us taxable income to make it more likely than not that the net operating loss deferred tax asset will be realized 
in making this assessment  the company has considered the ability to utilize certain tax planning strategies if a net operating loss were to otherwise expire 
the realization of the deferred tax asset is not assured and could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or the estimated benefits realizable from tax planning strategies are reduced 
the company s ability to record tax benefits in full or in part on future us net operating losses is also not assured 
financial leverage the company s long term debt as a percentage of total capitalization at december  was percent 
while the company s leverage level is not unusual for the forest products and pulp industries  this leverage  or higher leverage if the company were to incur additional indebtedness  could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it difficult to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes 
higher levels of leverage may require a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations to satisfy debt service requirements  thereby reducing the company s ability to use cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  development projects  acquisitions  dividends and other general corporate purposes 
higher leverage also limits flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in business and increases vulnerability to a downturn in the business and general adverse economic and industry conditions 
certain of the company s debt agreements contain customary conditions to borrowing  including compliance with financial covenants relating to maximum leverage ratios  net worth tests  minimum interest coverage ratios and minimum liquidity amounts 
the company s ability to comply with these covenants is subject to various risks  uncertainties and events beyond the company s control that could affect its ability to comply with the covenants 
any failure by the company to comply with all applicable covenants could result in an event of default with respect to  and the acceleration of  a portion of the company s debt 
labor relations approximately percent of the company s employees are paid on an hourly basis and most of these employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements 
in  the company negotiated memorandum of agreements for six year terms with the canadian unions at the castlegar sawmill and the arrow lakes forestry division 
the company is currently in negotiations with the canadian unions in midway  grand forks and boundary covering approximately employees 
if the company were unable to reach agreement on the terms of any collective bargaining agreement with any group of its employees  the company could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages 
british columbia s first nations people s claims to british columbia land the company s canadian forest operations are primarily carried out on public forestlands under forest licenses 
many of these lands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or common law rights of the first nations people of canada 
first nations groups in british columbia have made claims of ownership or interests in substantial portions of land in the province and are seeking compensation from the government with respect to these claims 
the supreme court of canada has held that the first nations groups have a spectrum of aboriginal rights in lands that have been traditionally used or occupied by their ancestors 
the court s decision did not apply to any particular lands and was stated in general terms 
the court held that aboriginal rights and title are not absolute and may be infringed upon by government in furtherance of a legislative objective  including forestry  subject to meeting a justification test and being consistent with the fiduciary relationship between government and first nations groups 
to address the claims of the first nations groups  the governments of canada and british columbia instituted a negotiation process under the administration of a treaty commission 
in july  the voting public approved a referendum of principles for treaty making 
this gave provincial negotiators the authority to negotiate and make commitments on topics that are consistent with the referendum principles and for which current policies exist 
any settlements that may result from the negotiation process may involve a combination of cash and resources and grants of conditional rights to gather food on public lands and some rights of self government 
the issues surrounding aboriginal rights and title are not likely to be resolved by the canadian governments in the near future 
recently  some aboriginal groups in british columbia have filed court proceedings against forest companies holding government granted forest tenures  claiming compensation from the tenure holders for what they claim is the wrongful use of their land and tenures 
the company has not received notice that any such court proceedings have been commenced against it 
if significant areas of canada are found by the courts to be subject to aboriginal title  the company s forest tenures and its ability to harvest timber from those tenures could be materially adversely affected 
a reduction in the timber supply could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial market risk the company s exposure to market risk for interest rates relates primarily to short and long term debt 
the company s investment in marketable securities at december  and was not significant 
the company s debt is primarily fixed rate with percent of total debt at variable rates at december   and therefore  net income is not materially affected when market interest rates change 
the company has exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk due to its significant operations in canada 
for the company  a weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar has a positive effect on the cost of operating in canada but has a negative foreign currency translation effect on the company s net investment in canadian operations 
the company s net investment in canadian subsidiaries is not hedged 
the net assets of canadian subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates were approximately million at december  the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent change in the canadian to us exchange rate would be approximately million at december  any gain or loss in fair value would be reflected as a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment and would not affect cash flows or reported net income or loss of the company 
the company is exposed to foreign currency transaction gains and losses primarily in the translation of us dollar denominated cash and accounts receivable of its canadian subsidiaries and canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans made by the parent company 
the company considers its canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans as a natural hedge against the currency risk on its us dollar denominated cash and accounts receivable of its canadian subsidiaries 
the company periodically uses foreign exchange contracts to manage a portion of its exposure to foreign currency transactions  but historically has not entered into material currency rate hedges with respect to exposure from its operations in canada 
the notional value of foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at december  was million and no such contracts were outstanding at december  the company utilizes well defined financial contracts in the normal course of its operations as a means to manage certain commodity price risks 
the majority of these contracts are fixed price contracts for future purchases of energy  primarily natural gas and electricity  which meet the definition of normal purchases or normal sales and therefore  are not considered derivative instruments for accounting purposes 
there were no contracts outstanding at december  and that were considered derivative instruments
