item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to  customer s reception of our products  intensity of competition  quality control during manufacturing and those set forth under risk factors 
overview we manufacture microdisplays that provide high resolution images suitable for applications such as high definition television  rear projection computer monitors and video projectors  and potential applications such as use in wireless communication devices  portable games and digital assistants 
our revenues through december  have been derived from the sales of a limited quantity of our commercial microdisplay products 
from through  we entered into agreements or memoranda of understanding with original equipment manufacturers oems in china and the republic of south korea contemplating the purchase by these prospective customers of our display units and or spatialight imagengine tm microdisplays for use in certain of their products 
all of these agreements generally require that we supply prototypes of our display units and or spatialight imagengine tm microdisplays and that they meet technical criteria satisfactory to each of such prospective customers 
in late january  we announced that we signed a purchase order agreement with skyworth display  one of the chinese oems with which we had an agreement to test prototypes of our microdisplay products  for the purchase by skyworth of  spatialight display units during a one year delivery period 
the purchase order originally provided for units to be delivered in february and an additional units in each of march and april skyworth and we subsequently agreed to delay the first delivery of units 
to date  we have completed shipment of of the units originally scheduled for delivery in the first month 
skyworth has recently advised us that it has decided to change the screen size format of the lcos televisions that it intends to manufacture using our display units 
as a result  skyworth is making necessary changes to certain of its internally developed electronics components  which skyworth has advised us will occur in the immediate future 
we expect to ship the remainder of the first units after skyworth completes these changes 
following the initial delivery provisions of units per month for the first three months  we are scheduled to deliver  units per month until the order is completed 
the purchase order is cancelable by skyworth on a quarterly basis and is subject to pricing contingencies and other customary terms and conditions 
in september  we announced that we signed a purchase order agreement with china electronics corporation cec  another of the chinese oems with which we had an agreement to test prototypes of our microdisplay products  for the purchase by cec of  display units from us 
the agreement provides for an initial delivery of ten display units  which was completed in september  with a second delivery of units to follow in the future 
additional shipments will be made periodically according to a schedule to be determined by cec and us 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase order  the current obligations of cec are backed by letters of credit in our favor 
the purchase order is cancelable by cec after delivery of units and is subject to other customary terms and conditions 
in october  we announced that we had signed a purchase order agreement with nanjing panda electronics co 
panda  a third chinese oem with which we had an agreement to test prototypes of our microdisplay products  for the purchase of  display units by panda 
the agreement provides for an initial television box integration phase  which was recently completed 
the agreement then provides for delivery of ten display units to panda  which we expect to occur in the immediate future  with a second delivery of display units to follow 
subsequent shipments under the purchase order will be made periodically according to a schedule to be determined by the parties 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase order  the obligations of panda will be backed by letters of credit in our favor 
the purchase order is cancelable by panda after delivery of ten display units and is subject to other customary terms and conditions 
in december  we signed a purchase order agreement with sct optronics company ltd 
sct  a chinese oem  for the purchase of  display units from spatialight 
the initial shipment of ten display units provided for under the agreement was completed in december future shipments are scheduled to be made periodically according to a schedule to be finally determined by sct and us 
the purchase order is cancelable by sct after delivery of ten display units and is subject to other customary terms and conditions 
in december  we signed a purchase order agreement with shanghai china display co  ltd 
china display  another chinese oem with which we had an agreement to test prototypes of our microdisplay products 
the agreement provides for the purchase by china display of  sets of three spatialight imagengine tm microdisplays 
pursuant to the purchase order  we completed an initial delivery of microdisplay sets to china display in december a second delivery of sets and a third delivery of sets are to follow 
the entire order is scheduled to be completed within a three month period 
we may mutually agree with china display to revise the delivery schedule 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase order  the obligations of china display will be backed by three letters of credit  the first of which was issued and paid to us 
the purchase order is not cancelable by china display  according to the terms of the purchase order  because the delivered microdisplay sets met china display s specifications 
the purchase order is subject to other customary terms and conditions 
in december  we signed a purchase order agreement with global display limited  a chinese oem  for the purchase of display units from spatialight 
shipments are scheduled to be made periodically according to a schedule to be finally determined by the parties 
the purchase order is cancelable by global display after the initial delivery of ten display units provided for under the agreement and is subject to other customary terms and conditions 
we are also currently negotiating the terms of purchase orders for our products with certain other prospective customers  primarily in china and south korea  some of whom are parties to the agreements or memoranda of understanding described in this item one of these parties is a large electronics manufacturer in south korea that we signed a development agreement with contemplating the purchase of sets of spatialight imagengine tm microdisplays 
with respect to prospective purchase orders  there are significant open issues that have to be finally negotiated  including prices and quantities of our products 
we cannot assure whether we will receive any purchase orders binding on any of these companies for their purchase of our microdisplay products in the near future 
even assuming that we receive purchase orders that are binding on the prospective customers  these orders and our sales to these customers are subject to certain contingencies described under risk factors in this item we are no longer working with daewoo electronics  with which we had an mou 
liquidity and capital resources through december   we have sustained recurring net losses from operations and  at december   we had net equity of approximately  during  we experienced negative cash flows from operating activities of approximately  and a net loss of approximately  our operations were funded in by the exercise of warrants and options of approximately  from the private placements of million of equity securities  including the sale to certain private purchasers  in late december  of million of equity securities that had been included in a shelf registration statement  and approximately  of revenues generated from the commercial sale of a limited quantity of our microdisplay products 
as of december   the company had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents  an increase of approximately  from the december  amount of  our net working capital at december   was approximately  compared to a net working capital deficit of approximately  at december  net cash used by operating activities totaled approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the increase was due to an increase in inventory for production needs in and a reduction in accounts payable to vendors 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  and  in and  respectively  resulting from net proceeds of  raised in three separate equity private placement transactions in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we have realized significant losses in the past and expect that these losses will continue until we start to receive significant revenues from the sale of our products 
we generated revenues of  from operations during the ramp up in manufacturing and commercialization of our microdisplays will require substantial expenditures during although we are expecting to generate revenues from purchase orders in  we may continue to operate at a loss during there can be no assurance that our business will operate on a profitable basis thereafter 
we anticipate that our cash expenditures during will approximate  per month  or million for the year  without regard to any revenues in we expect to meet our cash needs with our existing cash balances and collections from stock subscription receivable of approximately  and from the exercise of warrants held by existing investors 
in addition  we expect to fund working capital requirements by receiving payments from our customers in connection with signed purchase orders and by considering opportunities to obtain debt financing 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain such debt financing or that existing investors will exercise their warrants 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we have long term contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regards to payment of debt and lease arrangements 
the following table aggregates our expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  payments due by period and contractual obligations beyond total employment agreements    long term convertible debt   operating lease commitments       purchase commitments   total contractual cash obligations       results of operations revenues 
the company recognized revenues of  for the year ended december  revenues were related to initial shipments against purchase orders signed in no revenues were recognized in and cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold was   and in  and  respectively 
in  cost of goods sold consisted of product costs of  lower of cost or market adjustment of  as our initial inventory components were at a cost higher than we expect to incur for future purchase  and an inventory write down of  resulting from a physical count as we moved from preproduction to production 
in  cost of sales consisted of an inventory adjustment to lower of cost of market of selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately   and  in  and  respectively  and include professional services  salaries and related taxes and benefits  rent  depreciation  travel  insurance  and office expenses 
salaries and related taxes and benefits increased approximately  in over as a result of the reassignment of employees from research and development to general and administrative and the increase in the number of general and administrative staff  which was due to the transition toward commercial manufacturing of our microdisplay products 
an additional increase is due to fees of  reimbursed to robert a 
olins  our acting chief executive officer  for fees incurred in conjunction with the may private placement see note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report and an increase in rent expense of  the increase in expenses for over are due to an increase of  in legal fees pertaining to normal business and an increase in recruiting expenses related to a chief operating officer search of  these increases were off set by a  decrease in insurance expense resulting from a change in carrier  a decrease in coverage and an increase in employee contribution for medical expenses 
stock based general and administrative expenses 
stock based general and administrative expenses were approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the amounts incurred in  and relate to common shares  options to purchase common shares and warrants issued in exchange for services 
the increase in when compared to  relates primarily to stock based expense of approximately  associated with the may private placement 
of this amount   related to the deemed beneficial pricing of shares and warrants purchased by robert a 
olins  acting chief executive officer 
the decrease in when compared to  relates primarily to expenses incurred in related to stock options granted as compensation to directors valued at  as well as the issuance of  common shares granted as employee compensation valued at  the market value of the stock at the date of issuance 
the  common shares referred to above in december were issued to our former director of corporate development dcd 
in   common shares were issued as compensation valued at  the market value of the stock at the date of issuance 
the shares were issued in consideration of services rendered by the dcd with respect to assisting the company in negotiating the contractual relationships with its existing prospective customers 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were approximately  at december    at december  and  at december  the increase from when compared to  and subsequent decrease in is due to costs of approximately  expensed in  related to test units and the purchase of prototype engines for testing purposes 
additional decrease in over is due to reassignment of existing employees to general and administrative  offset by hiring of new employees 
interest income 
interest income was approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in was due to interest earned on a stock subscription receivable from a shareholder 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
interest expense 
interest expense was approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
these amounts are consistent with the balances in notes payable 
stock based interest expense 
stock based interest expense of   and  in  and  respectively  relates to the valuation of the beneficial conversion feature of interest converted and convertible into equity on the notes payable to argyle capital management corporation a company wholly owned by robert a 
olins  acting chief executive officer of the company based on the intrinsic value of the conversion feature 
the beneficial conversion interest represents the excess value of the shares received or receivable at current market prices over the per share conversion price 
the notes were extended until june resulting in a lower monthly amortization of the beneficial conversion in in addition  amortization of discounts on the argyle and alabama group notes is included in stock based interest expense 
loss before income taxes 
losses before income taxes were   and  in  and  respectively 
this increase from to is due primarily to increases of approximately  of stock based general and administrative expenses  an increase of  in general and administrative in compared to  offset by a decrease of approximately  in research and development expenses incurred as a result of pre production tooling costs and purchase of prototype engines of approximately  and a decrease in stock based interest expense of approximately  due to decrease in monthly amortization of beneficial conversion feature on notes payable 
the decrease from to is due primarily to a decrease of approximately  of stock based general and administrative expenses in compared to this decrease was offset by an increase of approximately  in research and development expenses incurred as a result of pre production tooling costs of approximately  and the purchase of prototype light engines for testing purposes 
income taxes 
income taxes consist primarily of minimum state tax requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions  particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates  where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and  generally to a lesser extent  cash flows 
senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates  and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 
revenue recognition we enter into commercial transactions to sell our products 
we evaluate revenue recognition for these transactions using the following criteria collectively called the revenue recognition criteria o evidence of an arrangement before revenue is recognized  we must have evidence of an agreement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions to deliver our products 
o delivery for products  delivery is considered to occur when title and risk of loss have been transferred 
o fixed or determinable fee we consider a fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment 
if a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize that amount as revenue when the amount becomes fixed or determinable 
we do not consider a fee to be fixed and determinable if any amount is due more than days from the delivery date 
payment terms of less than days are evaluated based upon the country in which the arrangement is entered into to assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable 
o collection is deemed reasonably assured collection is deemed reasonably assured if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we recognize revenue when collection becomes reasonably assured generally upon cash collection 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost based on the first in  first out method or market value 
we include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead in the cost of inventories 
in determining inventory market values  we give substantial consideration to the expected selling price of the product based on historical recovery rates 
if we assess the market value of our inventory to be less than costs we write it down to its replacement cost or its net realizable value 
our estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity and quality and mix of products in inventory  consumer and retailer preferences and economic conditions 
research and development our research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
income tax assets and liabilities in establishing our deferred income tax assets and liabilities  we make judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to our operations 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluate the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks  final us and foreign tax settlements  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions 
due to our lack of profitable operating history  potential limitations on usage of operating losses and general uncertainty  we provided for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we are also subject to examination of our income tax returns for multiple years by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
changes to our income tax provision or the valuation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities may affect our annual effective income tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
severance pay under sfas  in many cases  would be recognized over time rather than up front 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations  but may affect any exit or disposal activities entered into in the future 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as prescribed in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
additionally  sfas requires more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years ending after december   with early application permitted in certain circumstances 
adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operation  as we are not currently planning to make a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we did  however adopt the new disclosure provisions 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a qualified guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin no 
is effective on a prospective basis for qualified guarantees issued or modified after december  adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
we did  however adopt the new disclosure provisions 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a variable interest entity is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the company does not have any variable interest entities that must be consolidated 
in may  fasb issued accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the adoption of sfas no 
in did not have a material impact on the company s results of operation or financial position 
risk factors we have a history of losses and may incur losses in the future and therefore cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability 
we have incurred losses to date and have experienced cash shortages 
in and  we incurred net losses of approximately  and  respectively 
in addition  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we expect additional losses as we continue spending for production and other business activities as well as further research and development of our products 
as a result  we will need to generate substantial sales to support our costs of doing business before we can begin to recoup our operating losses and accumulated deficit and achieve profitability 
if we are unable to obtain further financing or generate required working capital  our ability to operate could suffer or cease 
our operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash and will continue to require substantial amounts of capital in the future 
in order to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant investments essential to our ability to operate profitably  including investments in further research and development  equipment  facilities and production activities 
although our financial condition and liquidity have been assisted through the exercises of warrants and public and private purchases of our common shares  including the approximately million raised by us in equity financings and  raised through exercises of stock options and warrants  we may still require additional financing to satisfy our increasing working capital requirements 
reliance for financing upon exercise of warrants  private equity purchase agreements and public offerings entails the additional risks of non exercise of such warrants because of the prevailing market prices of our underlying common shares  default by purchasers under these agreements or inability to sell publicly registered shares 
in the event that we are unable to obtain further financing  if any  on satisfactory terms  or we are unable to generate sales sufficient to offset our costs  or if our costs of development and operations are greater than we anticipate  we may be unable to grow our business at the rate desired or may be required to delay  reduce  or cease certain of our operations  any of which could materially harm our business and financial results 
we are subject to lengthy development periods and product acceptance cycles  which may significantly harm our business 
our business model requires us to develop microdisplays that perform better than existing technologies  contract with one or more third party manufacturers to manufacture our display units in bulk  and sell the resulting display units to original equipment manufacturers that will then incorporate them into their products 
original equipment manufacturers make the determination during their product development programs whether or not to incorporate our spatialight imagengine tm microdisplays and or display units in their products 
this requires us to invest significant amounts of time and capital in designing our spatialight imagengine tm microdisplays and or display units before we can be assured that we will generate any significant sales to our customers or even recover our investment 
if we fail to recover our investment in the spatialight imagengine tm microdisplays and or display units  it could seriously harm our financial condition 
in addition  the length of time that our products may be successfully received by our customers could be limited by the acceptance of new technologies developed by our competitors 
we incur substantial research and development costs in connection with technologies that may not be successful 
we currently have eleven full time engineering and seven full time manufacturing personnel based in california working on microdisplays 
this staffing creates significant research and development costs that may not be recouped 
even if our current microdisplays become accepted or successful  due to the rapid technological changes in our industry  we must continue to use  and may increase in number  our engineering and manufacturing personnel to develop future generations of our microdisplays 
as a result  we expect to continue incurring significant research and development costs 
we are currently manufacturing and shipping our microdisplays  but unanticipated difficulties in manufacturing our microdisplays may make it difficult to meet customer demands from time to time and our operating results could be significantly harmed by such difficulties 
we need to work closely with our manufacturing sources to assure production of our current microdisplays 
problems in production or lower than expected manufacturing yields could significantly harm our business because we will have already incurred the costs for the materials used in the microdisplay manufacturing process 
these problems could cause delays that might lead our potential customers to seek other sources 
we currently obtain silicon backplanes  a vital component in our microdisplays  from the far east 
some asian countries are subject to earthquakes  typhoons and political instability 
unless we obtain an alternative source  any disruption or termination of our silicon manufacturing source s operation in taiwan or air transportation with the far east could significantly harm our operations 
our microdisplays are assembled by combining the silicon backplanes with electronic components 
the design and manufacture of liquid crystal displays and display units are highly complex processes that are sensitive to a wide variety of factors  including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
we lease clean room space in california where we currently manufacture our spatialight imagengine tm microdisplays 
in addition  in january  we leased an additional clean room at the same location as the existing clean room to address current and anticipated increased manufacturing demand 
we believe that these current arrangements provide us with strong quality controls and effectively protect our proprietary technology in our products  but the risks discussed above associated with the highly complex processes of manufacturing these liquid crystal microdisplays remain applicable 
we continue to have working arrangements with the manufacturer of the light engines and lamps required in the assembly of our display units 
we have entered into an agreement for the supply of prisms and filters which are also required for the assembly of such units 
we do not have other such written agreements which are binding upon the manufacturers of the other components and no such manufacturer is bound to furnish us with any specific quantities of their products at previously specified prices 
at this date  we are not aware that any of our component manufacturers have known shortages of critical material 
because the manufacture of our spatialight imagengine tm microdisplays involves highly complex processes and technical problems may arise  we  in our capacity as manufacturing our liquid crystal microdisplays  which are an integral part of the display units  cannot assure the manufacturing yields of our products 
current purchase orders and future purchase orders  as to which we cannot give any assurance  will require us to produce greater quantities of our microdisplay products than we have produced in the past 
problems in production  including problems associated with increasing our production output or lower than expected manufacturing yields could significantly harm our business and operating results 
in addition  the complexity of our manufacturing processes will increase as the sophistication of our microdisplays and display units increases  and such complexities may lend to similar difficulties that could harm our business and operating results 
if markets for our products do not continue to develop  our business will likely be significantly harmed 
various target markets for our microdisplays  including high definition televisions  projectors  monitors  and portable microdisplays  are uncertain and may be slow to develop 
in addition  companies in those markets could utilize competing technologies 
high definition television has only recently become available to consumers  and widespread market acceptance  although anticipated  is uncertain 
in addition  the commercial success of the portable microdisplay market is uncertain 
the acceptance of our display units and or spatialight imagengine tm microdisplays will be dependent upon the pricing  quality  reliability and useful life of these units compared to competing technologies  as to which there can be no assurance 
in order for us to succeed  not only must we offer end product manufacturers better and less expensive microdisplays than our competitors  but the manufacturers themselves must also develop commercially successful products using our microdisplays 
spatialight s marketing efforts are focused on developing strategic customer and governmental relationships in china and the republic of south korea 
our failure to sell our microdisplays to such manufacturers or the failure of the ultimate target markets to develop as we expect will negatively effect our anticipated growth 
if our microdisplays do not become widely accepted by our customers or the end users  our business could be significantly harmed 
our microdisplays may not be accepted by a widespread market 
even if we successfully obtain customer orders  our customers may determine not to introduce or may terminate products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons  including the following o superior technologies developed by our competitors  o price considerations  and o lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products 
we currently have purchase order agreements with a limited number of customers 
despite our reasonable efforts to retain these customers  and obtain new customers we may not be successful in either of these regards 
the loss of any one or more of these customers or a failure to obtain new customers could materially harm our business and financial condition 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain additional purchase orders from our current or prospective customers  or  if we do  that such orders will generate significant revenues 
from through  we entered into agreements or memoranda of understanding mou with original equipment manufacturers oems in china and the republic of south korea for testing of our microdisplay products in contemplation of definitive purchase order agreements 
all of these agreements generally require that we supply prototypes of our display units and or spatialight imagengine tm microdisplays and that they meet technical criteria satisfactory to each of such prospective customers 
to date  we have received purchase orders from seven chinese oems 
certain other prospective customers have advised us that they are satisfied with the results of the testing of the prototypes under their agreements or mous with the company and we are currently negotiating terms of purchase orders for our display units and or spatialight imagengine tm microdisplays with each of them 
there are significant open issues with respect to these prospective purchase orders that have to be finally negotiated  including prices and quantities of our products 
we cannot offer assurance that we will receive  in the future  binding purchase orders from any of these companies for their purchase of our microdisplay products 
in addition  even if we receive purchase orders from our current or prospective customers for our microdisplay products  we may have problems implementing volume production of such microdisplay products 
furthermore  sales to manufacturers in the electronics industry are subject to severe competitive pressures  rapid technological change  and product obsolescence 
manufacturers may  at any time  cancel purchase orders or commitments or reduce or delay orders  thereby increasing our inventory and overhead risks 
therefore  even if we obtain purchase orders from several current or prospective customers  we cannot assure you that these agreements will result in significant revenues to us 
if our customers products are not successful  our business would be materially harmed 
we do not currently sell any products to end users 
instead  we design and manufacture various product solutions that our customers ie  oems may incorporate into their products 
as a result  our success depends almost entirely upon the widespread market acceptance of our customers products 
any significant slowdown in the demand for our customers products would materially harm our business 
our dependence on the success of the products of our customers exposes us to a variety of risks  including our need to do the following o maintain customer satisfaction with our design and manufacturing services  o match our design and manufacturing capacity with customer demand and maintain satisfactory delivery schedules  o anticipate customer order patterns  changes in order mix  and the level and timing of orders that we can meet  and o adjust to the cyclical nature of the industries and markets we serve 
our failure to address these risks may cause us to lose sales or for sales to decline 
the electronics industry is highly competitive  which may result in lost sales or lower gross margins 
we serve highly competitive industries that are characterized by price erosion  rapid technological change and competition from major domestic and international companies 
this intense competition could result in pricing pressures  lower sales  reduced margins and lower market share 
some of our competitors have greater market recognition  larger customer bases  and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than we possess 
as a result  they may be able to introduce new products and respond to customer requirements more quickly and effectively than we can 
our competitive position could suffer if one or more of our customers decide to design and manufacture their own microdisplay products  to contract with our competitors  or to use alternative technologies 
in addition  our customers typically develop a second source 
second source suppliers may win an increasing share of a program 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  both within and outside our control 
these factors include the following o our success in designing and manufacturing new display technologies  o our ability to address the needs of customers  o the quality  performance  reliability  features  ease of use  pricing  and diversity of our display products  o foreign currency fluctuations  which may cause a foreign competitor s products to be priced significantly lower than our displays  o the quality of our customer services  o the efficiency of our production sources  o the rate at which customers incorporate our displays into their own products  and o products or technologies introduced by our competitors 
our business is significantly affected by conditions or events occurring in the electronics industry generally 
the electronics industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices  and production over capacity 
since the electronics industry is cyclical in nature  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results because of general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations 
our results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future  which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
some of the factors that cause our operating results to fluctuate include the following o introductions of displays and market acceptance of new generations of displays  o timing of expenditures in anticipation of future orders  o changes in our cost structure  o availability of labor and components  o pricing and availability of competitive products and services  o the timing of orders  o the volume of orders relative to the capacity we can contract to produce  o evolution in the life cycles of customers products  and o changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
the market price of our common shares is highly volatile 
the market price of our common shares has been highly volatile  reflecting reported losses and receipt of additional financing 
other companies have found similar volatility correlates with class action securities lawsuits although to date we have not been a defendant in any such lawsuit 
the trading price of our common shares in the future could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  including the following o quarterly variations in our operating results  o actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new product developments by us or our competitors  o public announcements regarding our business developments  o changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance  o sales of large numbers of our common shares by our shareholders  o general conditions in the electronics industry  and o worldwide economic and financial conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations and other factors may adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
by further increasing the number of our common shares that may be sold into the market  additional offerings of our equity securities could cause the market price of our common shares to decrease significantly  even if our business operations are performing well 
the total number of our common shares and warrants to purchase our common shares  sold in two private financings and one public financing completed in represents approximately of the total number of our common shares that are issued and outstanding as of march  sales of these shares  into and within the public market  or the perception that future sales of these common shares could occur  might adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares in the near future 
our common shares may not be liquid 
our common shares are currently traded on the nasdaq smallcap market 
our shareholders may find that it is more difficult to sell our common shares than shares that are listed on the nasdaq national market  american stock exchange or new york stock exchange 
the trading volume of our common shares may be adversely affected due to the limited marketability of our common shares 
any substantial sales of our common shares may result in a material reduction in price because relatively few buyers may be available to purchase our common shares 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  our ability to compete could be harmed 
our development and operations depend substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and qualified technical personnel 
our products require sophisticated production  research and development and technical support 
the competition for qualified management and technical personnel is intense 
the loss of services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to add key personnel could have a material adverse affect on us  particularly since currently we do not have any insurance policies in place to cover that contingency 
our success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  marketing  manufacturing  financial and other key management personnel 
we face intense competition for the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products and technology 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain such personnel or not incur significant costs in order to do so 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property from use by third parties  our ability to compete in the industry will be harmed 
we believe that our success depends in part on protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements from our employees  consultants and advisors and other contractual provisions  to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products and technology is difficult  however 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  we face the following risks o pending patent applications may not be issued  o patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  o unauthorized parties may obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  o others may independently develop similar technology or design around any patents issued to us  o breach of confidentiality agreements  o intellectual property laws may not protect our intellectual property  and o effective protection of intellectual property rights may be limited or unavailable in some foreign countries  such as china  in which we may operate 
specifically  although we consider the following unlikely because of the complex technological structure of our products  one or more of our current or prospective chinese or korean customers  or their respective employees or other persons including our competitors  that have or gain access to our products for testing purposes  may seek to misappropriate or improperly convert to their own use our intellectual property and a lack of adequate remedies and impartiality under the chinese and korean legal systems may adversely impact our ability to protect our intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that we will have adequate remedies in the event any of the foregoing materializes 
failure to protect our intellectual property would limit our ability to produce and market our products in the future  which would materially adversely affect our revenues generated by the sale of such products 
in addition  third parties could assert that our products and technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights 
as a result  we may become subject to future patent infringement claims or litigation  the defense of which is costly  time consuming and diverts the attention of management and other personnel 
political  economic and regulatory risks associated with international operations may limit our ability to do business abroad 
a substantial number of our manufacturers  customers and suppliers are located outside of the united states  principally in the far east 
our international operations are subject to political and economic conditions abroad  and protectionist trade legislation in either the united states or foreign countries  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export or import compliance laws  or other trade policies  any of which could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell displays in foreign markets and to purchase materials or equipment from foreign suppliers 
all of our current agreements with customers are governed by foreign law and therefore  are subject to uncertainty with regard to their enforceability 
risks related to doing business in china may negatively affect our business 
our business is subject to significant political and economic uncertainties and may be adversely affected by political  economic and social developments in china 
over the past several years  the chinese government has pursued economic reform policies including the encouragement of private economic activity and greater economic decentralization 
the chinese government may not continue to pursue these policies or may significantly alter them to our detriment from time to time with little  if any  prior notice 
a lack of adequate remedies and impartiality under the chinese legal system may adversely impact our ability to do business in china and to enforce the agreements or purchase orders to which we are  or may become  a party 
at various times during recent years  the united states and china have had significant disagreements over political  economic and social issues 
controversies may arise in the future between these two countries 
any political or trade controversies between the united states and china  whether or not directly related to our business  could adversely affect our ability to do business in china 
we do not pay cash dividends 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common shares and do not anticipate that we will pay cash dividends in the near future 
instead  we intend to apply any future earnings to the expansion and development of our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we place all of our excess cash and cash equivalents in a checking account or money market account in the united states with a nationally reputable bank 
we do not expect any material losses from the company s placement of such cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is modest 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled  we do not have any immediate foreign currency exposure as nearly all of the company s business is transacted in united states currency
