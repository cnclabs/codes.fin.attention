consolidated operations other income expense on june   the company issued the original notes with a principal amount of million  substantially all of which were later exchanged for the company s senior secured notes that were registered under the securities act of  as amended  and had substantially the same terms collectively  the notes 
interest expense on the notes of million plus related amortization of loan fees totaled approximately million 
in addition  the interest expense on the retired first mortgage notes  the retired black hawk first mortgage notes and equipment and other financing costs totaled approximately million in for a combined total of interest expense of million 
this compares with million in interest expense in fiscal results were affected by the loss on extinguishment of debt totaling million or per share 
the costs included the call premium on the company s refinanced first mortgage notes and riviera black hawk s refinanced first mortgage notes  the write off of unamortized deferred loan costs associated with the refinanced bonds and the balance of the original issue discount on the first mortgage notes

see note to the financial statements  other long term liabilities 
although there is no current intention to require this funding  under certain circumstances  approximately million could be disbursed in a short period 
for  the company s net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in due primarily to the payment of interest to defease the old notes in cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in due to the increase in capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing was million in compared to cash used in financing activities of million in management believes that cash flow from operations  combined with the million cash and the million remaining on our senior secured credit facility discussed below  will be sufficient to cover the company s debt service and enable investment in budgeted capital expenditures of million for the next twelve months 
on june   the company secured new debt in the principal amount of million in the form of the notes with a maturity date of june  interest on the notes is at the annual rate of paid semiannually on each june and december  beginning december  the net proceeds of the notes  along with cash on hand  were used to defease riviera las vegas first mortgage notes due and to defease riviera black hawk s first mortgage notes with contingent interest due cash flow from operations is not expected to be sufficient to pay of the principal of the notes at maturity 
accordingly  the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to repay the notes at maturity will be dependent upon thier ability to refinance the notes 
there can be no assurance that the company and its subsidiaries will be able to refinance the principal amount of the notes at maturity 
on or after june   the company may redeem the notes from time to time at a premium beginning at and declining each subsequent year to par in the indenture governing the notes the note indenture provides that  in certain circumstances  the company and its subsidiaries must offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control or certain other events 
in the event of such mandatory redemption or repurchase prior to maturity  the company and its subsidiaries would be unable to pay the principal amount of the notes without a refinancing 
the note indenture contains certain covenants  which limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions  to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or other distributions  repurchase capital stock or other equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  create certain liens  sell certain assets  and enter into certain mergers and consolidations 
as a result of these restrictions  the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness to fund operations or to make capital expenditures is limited 
in the event that cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover cash requirements  the company and its subsidiaries would be required to curtail or defer certain of their capital expenditure programs under these circumstances  which could have an adverse effect on operations 
at december   the company believes that it is in compliance with the covenants 
on july   the company entered into a million  five year senior secured credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by substantially the same collateral that secures the notes 
the lien on the collateral securing the credit facility is senior to the lien on the collateral securing the notes 
the credit facility contains customary conditions to borrowing and certain representations and warranties customary in gaming related finance 
the credit facility also contains financial covenants and restrictions regarding  among other things  indebtedness  distributions and changes in control 
under the credit facility  the company can obtain extensions of credit in the forms of cash and letters of credit 
the company is required to pay interest on all outstanding cash advances at the rate of interest announced by wells fargo at its principal office in san francisco at its prime rate plus or at the rate at which major international banks in london charge each other for borrowings in us dollars plus 
however  the minimum interest rate we will be charged on outstanding cash advances is

management periodically evaluates its policies  estimates and assumptions related to  these policies 
the company operates in a highly regulated industry 
for both our las vegas  nevada and black hawk  colorado operations we are subject to regulations that describe and regulate operating and internal control procedures 
the majority of our casino revenue is in the form of cash  personal checks or gaming chips and tokens  which by their nature do not require complex estimations 
we estimate certain liabilities with payment periods that extend for longer than several months 
such estimates include customer loyalty liabilities  self insured medical and workers compensation costs and litigation costs 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable based upon our past experience with the business and based upon our assumptions related to possible outcomes in the future 
however  actual future results will likely differ from these estimates 
the company has determined that the following accounting policies and related estimates are critical to the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements long lived assets the company has a significant investment in long lived property and equipment 
the company estimates that the non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets exceed the current carrying value of these assets 
any adverse change to the estimate of these non discounted future cash flows could necessitate an impairment charge that would adversely affect operating results 
the company estimates useful lives for its assets based on historical experience  estimates of assets commercial lives  and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
should the actual useful life of a class of assets differ from the estimated useful life  the company would record an impairment charge 
the company reviews useful lives  obsolescence  and assesses commercial viability of these assets periodically 
deferred tax assets we utilize estimates related to cash flow projections for the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
to the realization of deferred tax assets 
our estimates are based upon recent operating results and budgets for future operating results 
these estimates are made using assumptions about the economic  social and regulatory environments in which we operate 
these estimates could be negatively impacted by numerous unforeseen events including changes to regulations affecting how we operate our business  changes in the labor market or economic downturns in the areas where we operate 
provision for credit losses the company maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
any unforeseen change in customer liquidity or financial condition could adversely affect the collectibility of that account and the company s operating results 
litigation reserves the company assesses its exposures to loss contingencies including legal matters and provides for an exposure if it is judged to be probable and estimable 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from management s estimate  operating results could be impacted 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation  and non union employee medical insurance coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
in estimating these costs  the company considers its historical claims experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
loyalty club program we offer to our guests the opportunity to earn points redeemable for cash and complimentary rooms and food and beverage based on their level of gaming and non gaming activities while at our properties 
an accrual is recorded as points are earned based upon expected redemption rates and  in the case of complimentaries  the estimated cost of the complimentary to be provided
