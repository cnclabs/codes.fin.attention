item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our primary business is the manufacturing and marketing of plastic films for use in the packaging  transportation  beverage  food  automotive  pharmaceutical  chemical  electronics  construction  agricultural and textile industries 
we currently have manufacturing operations located in nine countries in north america  europe and the asia pacific region 
we manufacture plastic films  principally from resins blended with other raw materials 
we may either sell the film or further process it by metallizing  printing  laminating  slitting or converting it 
our processing technologies enable us to create a variety of value added products according to the specifications of our customers 
resin costs generally averages between and of the cost of goods sold  however this rose to approximately for some product lines during the first six months of fiscal since resin costs typically fluctuate  selling prices are generally determined as a spread over resin costs  usually expressed as cents per pound 
accordingly  costs and profits are most often expressed in cents per pound  and  with certain exceptions  the historical increases and decreases in resin costs have generally been reflected over a period of time in the sales prices of the products on a penny for penny basis 
assuming a constant volume of sales  an increase in resin costs should  therefore  result in increased sales revenues but lower gross profit as a percentage of sales or gross profit margin  while a decrease in resin costs should result in lower sales revenues with higher gross profit margins and thus no impact on gross profit 
while we experienced some pricing relief during the second half of fiscal  the frequent increases in resin prices during latter part of fiscal and during our first and second quarters of fiscal  resulted in customer resistance and competitive pressure  and we were not able to pass all of these increases to our customers effectively during the fiscal year ended october  this adversely affected our revenue  gross profit and earnings in fiscal and there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on resin price increases on a penny for penny basis in the future 
results of operations year ended october   as compared to year ended october  net sales and gross profit net sales for the year ended october   increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended october  the increase in net sales included million of positive impact of foreign exchange and other increases comprised primarily of price increases attributable to higher raw material costs primarily resin which were partially passed on to customers of  or for the fiscal year 
net sales in north america increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  primarily due to a increase in per unit average selling prices combined with a less that increase in sales volume 
the increase in average selling prices is attributable to higher raw material costs  primarily resin  which because of the competitive market place were not entirely passed through to customers during fiscal net sales in europe increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to the positive impact of foreign exchange of million  which was partially offset by million due to lower per unit selling prices primarily as a result of the continuing general economic pressures of the region and the competitive marketplace 
net sales in asia pacific increased million to million during fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to the positive impact of foreign exchange of million  which increased average selling prices 
a change in product mix also had a positive impact on pricing  which increased per unit average selling price 
gross profit for the year ended october   was million compared to million for the year ended october  this increase of million in gross profit was primarily a result of the positive impact of foreign exchange of million  higher gross profit realized in north american and asia pacific of million offset by lower gross profit margin in europe of million 
gross profit in north america increased million  or  to million for the year ended october   as a result of the positive impact of foreign exchange of approximately  and being able to pass through to customers higher raw material costs  primarily resin  during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  which we were not able to pass through in fiscal  and a increase in fourth quarter volume 
gross profit in europe decreased million  or to million for fiscal from million for the year ended october  this decrease without the positive effect of foreign exchange of million  would have been million for the period 
this decrease was primary due to the continuing general economic pressures of the region  the competitive marketplace and the inability to pass through all resin cost increases during the period 
this decrease also included  of restructuring charges relating to the final phase of our shutdown of the united kingdom facilities and a  inventory write down associated with the liquidation of fiap see note no 
to our consolidated financial statements 
asia pacific gross profit for the year ended october   increased to million from million for the like period in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was a result of the positive impact of foreign exchange of million and change in sales mix to higher gross margin products and overall manufacturing efficiencies that were completed during the fiscal year 
operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended october  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for the prior fiscal year 
the fiscal operating expenses include million of shut down costs and of accounts receivable write downs pertaining to the voluntarily liquidation of fiap see note no 
to our consolidated financial statements and also includes million of negative impact of foreign exchange  partially offset by other decreases of  or  for fiscal delivery expenses for fiscal were million versus million in the prior year 
after giving effect to the negative foreign exchange impact of million  delivery expenses decreased by million from the prior year as a result of lower worldwide third party delivery costs 
selling expenses increased by million to million from million in the same period in the prior fiscal year 
this increase can be primarily attributed to the negative impact of foreign exchange of million 
total foreign selling expenses decreased by  which offset increased selling expenses in north america relating to commissions  general insurance  and healthcare costs 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal  including of accounts receivable write downs pertaining to the voluntarily liquidation of fiap  increased by million to million from million in the same period in the prior fiscal year 
this general increase of million was primarily due to a negative foreign exchange impact of million on overall foreign general and administrative expenses 
the balance of the increases is attributable to increase in the cost of general insurance  healthcare and third party consulting fees 
other operating income expense other operating income expense for the year ended october   amounted to a million in income for the period  which included gains on sale of our united kingdom land sale of million  the gain of  realized on the sale and leaseback of our spain manufacturing facility offset by  in losses on sales of machinery and equipment during the period 
interest expense  net interest expense  net for the year ended october   was million compared to million for the year ended october  this slight increase in interest expense resulted from higher average debt outstanding during fiscal versus fiscal  partially offset by lower average interest rates paid in fiscal gain on sale of interest in joint venture on may   the company sold its percent ownership of rapak asia pacific limited rapak to its joint venture partner  ds smith uk limited and received sale proceeds of million  net of expenses 
during fiscal  the company s share of rapak losses amounted to approximately million  which reduced the investment value to million 
the sale produced a gain of million million after tax 
gain on sale of interests in subsidiary on november   the company acquired all of the shares of the new zealand and australian flexible packaging businesses of visypak operations pty limited visypak for approximately million us dollars 
immediately following the acquisition  the company combined its liquipac bag in box business with the liquibag systems business it had acquired from visypak and sold of the new company to ds smith uk limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of ds smith  plc  for million  resulting in a gain of million

the fiscal provision for income taxes includes a million increase in valuation allowances relating to certain foreign deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards in which the company has determined that it is more likely than not that the carryforwards will not be fully utilized 
see note no 
to the consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the benefit that would be computed for statutory purposes 
year ended october   as compared to year ended october  net sales and gross profit net sales for the year ended october   increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended october  net sales in north america decreased to million in fiscal from million during fiscal the decline resulted from an overall decrease in raw materials cost as compared to the prior fiscal year  resulting in a decrease in per unit selling prices partially offset by a increase in sales volume 
net sales in europe decreased million or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices and decrease in sales volume as a result of the competitive market place in the region 
net sales in asia pacific increased to million during fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of the visypak film and laminating businesses located in new zealand and australia  which increased sales volume by and average selling prices by 
gross profit for the year ended october   was million compared to million for the year ended october  gross profit in north america decreased million or to million for the year ended october  although average raw materials cost per unit was below those incurred in the prior year  resin costs increased substantially during the last four months of fiscal reductions in per unit manufacturing costs resulting from the company s cost containment efforts combined with the effects of increases in volume were insufficient to fully offset the company s inability to pass though these increased resin costs to our customers in the highly competitive market place 
gross profit in europe decreased to million for the year ended october  primarily due to the continuing general economic pressures of the region and the competitive marketplace  which resulted in lower average selling prices 
during the same period in fiscal  the european region incurred additional costs of million relating to its shutdown of the uk manufacturing facility and set up costs on the transfer of the uk manufacturing equipment to spain 
asia pacific gross profit for fiscal  increased by to million  as a result of the acquisition of the visypak film and laminates businesses  which increased sales volume of higher gross margin products in the region  which offset lower average per unit selling prices of other products 
the general economic pressures and highly competitive marketplace in the region negatively effected the asia pacific margins 
gross profit for fiscal included million of restructuring charges recorded for the shut down of the melbourne  australia facility 
operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended october   were million  an increase of million or from million for the year ended october  delivery expenses increased to million in the current period from million in the prior fiscal year  primarily due to the increase in worldwide sales volume  which increased our third party delivery costs 
selling and general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase can be primarily attributed to the visypak acquisition and commissions paid on the increased sales volume sold during the year offset by a decrease of million of goodwill amortization from fiscal effective november   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
and therefore ceased the amortization of its goodwill 
other operating income expense other operating income expense for the year ended october   amounted to  from gains on sales of equipment versus million in the prior year  which included a million gain on the sale of its former new jersey operating facility  and other miscellaneous income and expenses of million for the close down of our manufacturing facilities in england and million of restructuring charges for the closedown of our melbourne  australia  plant 
interest expense  net interest expense for the year ended october   was million compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease in interest expense resulted from lower average interest rates paid during the current period partially offset by higher average debt outstanding for the period 
gain on sale of interests in subsidiary on november   the company acquired all of the shares of the new zealand and australian flexible packaging businesses of visypak operations pty limited visypak for approximately million us dollars 
immediately following the acquisition  the company combined its liquipac bag in box business with the liquibag systems business it had acquired from visypak and sold of the new company to ds smith uk limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of ds smith  plc  for million  resulting in a gain of million 
other income expense other income expense  net for the year ended october   amounted to a million expense versus other income of  for fiscal this amount included foreign currency transaction losses of million realized during the current period versus gains of  in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through cash flow generated from operations and borrowings by us and our subsidiaries under various credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash have been to fund working capital  including operating expenses  debt service and capital expenditures 
our working capital amounted to million at october   compared to million at october  this million decrease in working capital was primarily the result of a million increase in short term borrowings by our foreign subsidiaries and a decrease of million in current deferred tax assets 
these decreases were offset by a net increase in working capital of million due to the liquidation of our fiap business which resulted from a million reclassification to current assets of the net book value of our property which is held for sale in italy  partially offset by additional reserves on its account receivable and inventory of million and accruals for severance benefits of million 
the improved management of our accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable helped improve our working capital by approximately million for the year 
on november   we entered into a loan and security agreement with congress financial corporation  as agent  and the financial institutions named in the agreement  as lenders 
under this agreement the lenders provided a maximum credit facility of million  including a letter of credit facility of up to million 
amounts available for borrowing are based upon the sum of eligible domestic values of buildings and equipment at the closing date and eligible accounts receivable and inventories on a monthly basis 
the credit facility is secured by mortgages and liens on our domestic assets and on of our equity ownership in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the agreement contains customary bank covenants  including limitations on the incurrence of debt  the disposition of assets  the making of restricted payments and the payment of cash dividends 
if the loan s excess availability  as defined  is less than million  we must meet certain minimum financial covenants including the activation of a lock box whereby daily cash collections would automatically pay down the credit facility 
if the loan s excess availability is less than million  we are subject to further restrictions including limitations on inter company funding 
during fiscal the excess availability under this credit facility ranged from million to million 
for the period from february  to july  the lock box was activated and we were required to meet the aforementioned financial covenants 
during this period  the amounts outstanding under the credit facility were classified as a current liability  which resulted in a deficit in our working capital 
we currently project that our excess availability under this facility will exceed million throughout fiscal based upon fiscal budgeted financial statements and budgeted cash requirements 
interest payable under this facility is based upon excess availability levels or certain leverage ratios at a margin of prime rate plus 
to for overnight borrowings and libor plus a range of to for term loans up to one year 
as of october   there was million outstanding at under this credit facility with excess availability of million 
this credit facility expires in november and is expected to be refinanced at that time 
in november  we completed an offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated debentures due november  debentures 
the issue price was resulting in an effective yield of 
the debentures contain certain customary representations  warranties  covenants and conditions such as  but not limited to  cash flow ratio and certain restrictions on  but not limited to  dividends  consolidations and certain asset sales and additional indebtedness 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the debentures at october  we maintain various credit facilities at our foreign subsidiaries 
at october   the aggregate amount outstanding under such facilities was million of which million is secured by various assets of the foreign subsidiaries which may include accounts receivable  inventories and machinery and equipment 
the amount of the collateral at october  was million 
there was million additional availability under these facilities at october  the company guarantees certain of the debt of its foreign subsidiaries through corporate guarantees aggregating approximately million at october  there are no existing events of default that would require the company to satisfy these guarantees 
borrowings under these facilities are used to support operations at such subsidiaries and are generally serviced by local cash flow from operations 
during fiscal  the company entered into two capital leases totaling million related to manufacturing equipment 
the current portion of these leases is contained in accrued liabilities and the long term portion of million is contained in other long term liabilities 
these capital leases will be paid in full by fiscal our cash and cash equivalents were million at october   as compared to million at october  net cash provided in operating activities during the fiscal year ended october   was million  primarily due to depreciation and amortization of million  million relating to provisions for the shutdown of fiap  decreases in accounts receivable and inventories including provision for losses of million  decreases in other current and long term assets of million  in equity interest in subsidiary of million  and in deferred tax assets of million and increases in accrued expenses and long term liabilities of million offset by a net loss for the period of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million  the gain of million on the sale of our interests in joint venture and million gain on sales of property  plant and equipment 
in each period  the net decreases in other operating assets and liabilities reflect normal operating activity 
net cash provided from investing activities during the year ended october   was million  resulting primarily from proceeds of million from the sale of our interest in our rapak joint venture and million proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment  of which million and million resulted from the sale of our united kingdom land and the sale leaseback of our spanish land and building  respectively 
this was offset by our investment in capital expenditures of million 
net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal  was million  reflecting net repayments of million offset by proceeds from stock issuances of  the company s aggregate commitments under its loan agreement  senior subordinated debentures  foreign borrowings  capital leases and noncancelable operating lease agreements as of october   are as follows for the fiscal years ending october  borrowings capital leases operating leases total commitment amounts in thousands thereafter the company expects to refinance its senior subordinated debentures and its revolving credit facility during fiscal year the company has estimated that it will use approximately million of cash in the fiap shutdown in fiscal the company knows of no current or pending demands or commitments that will materially affect its liquidity 
the company s has approximately million of unfunded pension benefit obligations at october  for its foreign locations 
the company announced in november  that from time to time and as permitted by its various loan agreements  it may repurchase up to million of its senior subordinated debentures 
we believe that our cash on hand at october  and our cash flow from operations  assuming no material adverse change  combined with the availability of funds under the current credit facility and credit lines available to our foreign subsidiaries for local currency borrowings will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
at october   the company had an aggregate of approximately million available under these credit facilities 
effects of inflation inflation is not expected to have significant impact on our business 
contingencies in fiscal  the company s holland subsidiary was served by the european commission with a notice to produce various documents and other evidence relating to its investigation of a possible violation of european competition law by the subsidiary 
the company is cooperating with the european commission in its investigation 
at this time  no litigation is pending against the company involving this matter  and the company is not in a position to evaluate the outcome of this investigation 
however  there can be no assurance that in the event that the european commission serves a statement of objections instituting a proceeding against the company s holland subsidiary which results in a fine being assessed  that the amount of the fine would not be material 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  product returns  doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  assets held for sale  income taxes  financing operations  retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  including customer rebates  promotions and other incentive programs estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or potentially obsolete inventories  lifo valuations and litigation accruals accounting for income taxes  estimating the realizability of deferred tax assets and evaluating income tax contingencies derivative instruments cash flow hedges purchase accounting and valuation of investment in joint venture impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill estimating the costs to shutdown divested entities the company recognizes sales and cost of sales at the time the product is shipped to the customer and records estimated reductions to revenue for customer rebates  returns  promotions or other incentive programs 
customer rebate programs are based upon annual rebate agreements based upon predetermined sales volume requirements and accrued at each customer s agreed rebate percentage 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive programs  thus resulting in a reduction of gross sales and profit at the time the incentive is offered 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age  applying historical trend rates to the most recent months sales  less account write offs to date 
when it is deemed probable that a customer account is uncollectable  that balance is added to the calculated reserve 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and may be affected by changes in the general economic conditions 
management reviews its physical inventories at each business unit to determine the obsolescence of the products on hand 
when the company determines it has obsolete inventory  our north america operations scrap those inventory items and our international operations establish the appropriate reserve for these items 
the company maintains its united states inventory on the lifo method of inventory valuation  except for supplies 
the lifo valuation is reviewed quarterly for net realizable value and adjusted accordingly 
management s current estimated ranges of liabilities related to pending litigation are based on management s best estimate of future costs 
final resolution of the litigation contingencies could result in amounts different from current accruals and  therefore  have an impact on the company s consolidated financial results in a future reporting period 
the company is involved in routine litigation in the normal course of its business and these proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
management accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 an asset and liability approach is required 
such approach results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on the future taxable income of the entity to which the deferred tax asset relates 
management assesses the likelihood that such deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
should the future taxable income of such entities be materially different from management s estimates an additional valuation allowance may be necessary in future periods 
such amounts  if necessary  could be material to our results of operations and financial position  as they were in fiscal the company operates internationally giving rise to exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
derivative financial instruments are utilized by the company to reduce these risks 
the company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
certain of the company s intercompany loans are short term in nature 
in those loans  the company primarily enters into forward exchange contracts with terms that mirror the existing intercompany loans  which give rise to the foreign currency risk 
gains and losses on these derivatives are recognized for changes in the fair value of these derivatives in the consolidated statements of operations for each reporting period 
in addition  the company hedges foreign currency risk on third party commitments with cash flow hedges 
at the inception of the hedge the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and appropriate documentation is prepared 
on an on going basis the company assesses hedge effectiveness for all designated hedges in order to determine that each derivative continues to be effective 
should these cash flow hedges prove to be ineffective  changes in the fair value of the derivatives would be recognized in operations each reporting period 
the acquisition of visypak in november was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition 
we formed a new zealand company  rapak asia pacific ltd 
rapak and sold of the venture to ds smith as part of a joint venture agreement for the operation of rapak 
rapak acquired the bag in box business conducted by visy in new zealand and australia  and we transferred our new zealand liquipac business to rapak 
we retained the flexible packaging business we acquired from visy 
since we did not have an effective controlling voting interest in this venture  we have accounted for our investment under the equity method of accounting 
we recorded our equity in the income or losses of rapak based upon the best information available as of the date of the financial statements 
on may   we sold our ownership of rapak to our joint venture partner  ds smith and received sale proceeds of million  net of expenses 
during fiscal  our share of rapak losses amounted to approximately million  which reduced the investment value to million 
the sale produced a pre tax gain of million million after tax  which is included within the balance of the other income expense in the accompanying statement of operations for the fiscal year ended october  we have used our best estimates in establishing the asset impairment charges  provisions  writedowns and reserves recorded as a result of the voluntary liquidation of fiap 
we estimated the net realizable value of fiap s accounts receivable based on an analysis of collections made subsequent to october  as well as regarding the collectibility of the remaining customer balances for which payment has yet to be received 
the write down of inventories was determined based on an analysis of sales made subsequent to october   and estimates regarding the net realizable value of inventory remaining to be sold 
we estimated the net realizable value of machinery and equipment based on sales made subsequent to october   and an estimate of the net realizable value of machinery and equipment  land and building remaining to be sold based on third party offers received by us to date 
employee termination benefits were determined based on negotiation with the local italian union 
the agreement with the union was comprised of three items compliance with the italian government required social plan  exit bonus for each employee negotiated between us and the union  and payment of the accrued termination indemnity fund  a statutorily determined amount which we had accrued monthly 
additionally  as part of the shutdown of the fiap facility in italy  we closed our fiap sales office located in meudon  france 
all five employees have been terminated 
the severance package was determined by statutory law and is expected to be paid during the first quarter of fiscal the write downs  provisions and reserves relating to the liquidation of fiap were based upon the company s best estimates given the information available at the filing date 
actual realizable values or payments to be made may be different from such estimates and such differences will be recorded in fiscal on november   we elected to adopt the provision of sfas no 
as required by sfas no 
 we perform an annual assessment as to whether there was an indication that goodwill is impaired 
the company performed its annual impairment analysis under sfas on september  based on a comparison of the company s market capitalization to its book value at that date 
the company also performed a supplemental estimate of the fair value of the company using comparable industry multiples of cash flows compared to the book value of the company 
the company s policy is that impairment of goodwill will have occurred if the market capitalization of the company were to remain below book value for a period of more than six months or the estimated value of the company based on cash flow multiples is below book value 
should the carrying value of the company exceed its fair value for an other than temporary period of time  the amount of any resulting goodwill impairment may be material to our financial position and results of operations 
the company concluded that goodwill was not impaired at september  the company plans to perform its impairment test at september each fiscal year 
we also review our financial position quarterly for other triggering events as described in sfas no 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations and other sections of this report contain forward looking statements about prospects for the future  such as our ability to generate sufficient working capital  amount of excess availability under our credit facility  our ability to continue to maintain sales and profits of our operations and our ability to generate sufficient funds to meet our cash requirements 
we wish to caution readers that the assumptions which form the basis for forward looking statements with respect to  or that may impact earnings or liquidity for  the year ending october   include many factors that are beyond our ability to control or estimate precisely 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  availability of raw materials  ability to pass raw material price increases to customers in a timely fashion  the potential of technological changes which would adversely affect the need for our products  price fluctuations which could adversely impact our inventory  and changes in united states or international economic or political conditions  such as inflation or fluctuations in interest or foreign exchange rates 
parties are cautioned not to rely on any such forward looking statements or judgments in this section and in other parts of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
the company seeks to minimize these risks through operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates the company may use interest rate swaps  collars and options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at october   the company was not a party to any interest rate swaps  collars or options 
the fair value of the company s fixed interest rate debt varies with changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
at october   the carrying value of the company s total debt was million of which approximately million was fixed rate debt 
as of october   the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt  which includes the cost of replacing the company s fixed rate debt with borrowings at current market rates  was approximately million 
foreign exchange the company enters into derivative financial instruments principally foreign exchange forward contracts against the euro  canadian dollar  australian dollar and new zealand dollar primarily to hedge intercompany transactions and trade sales and purchases 
foreign currency forward contracts reduce the company s exposure to the risk that the eventual cash inflows and outflows  resulting from these intercompany and third party trade transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency  will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
as of october   the company had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding with a notional contract amount of million  all of which have a maturity of less than one year 
at october   the net fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges by the company was a loss of million  which is included in accrued expenses 
the company s foreign subsidiaries had third party outstanding debt of approximately million on october  such debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary 
the company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  thereby reducing its need to enter into foreign exchange forward contracts 
commodities the company uses commodity raw materials  primarily resin  and energy products in conjunction with its manufacturing process 
generally  the company acquires such components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
as a result  the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices in connection with these components 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties we describe below and the other information in this annual report or incorporated by reference before deciding to invest in  or retain  shares of our common stock 
these are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial  or that we have not predicted  may also harm our business operations or adversely affect us 
if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition  operating results or liquidity could be materially harmed 
industry risks our business is dependent on the availability of raw materials and our ability to pass on price increases to our customers the principal raw materials that we use in our products are polyethylene  polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride resins 
our ability to operate profitably is dependent  in large part  on the market for these resins 
the supply and demand for these resins and the petro chemical intermediates from which they are produced are subject to substantial price fluctuations and market disturbances  including occasional shortages of supply 
prices fluctuate as a result of changes in natural gas and oil prices and the capacity of the companies that produce these products 
our ability to maintain profitability is heavily dependent upon our ability to pass through to our customers the full amount of any increase in raw material costs 
if there is overcapacity in the production of any specific product that we manufacture and sell  we frequently are not able to pass through the full amount of any cost increase 
if resin prices increase and we are not able to fully pass on the increases to our customers  our results of operations and our financial condition will be adversely affected 
intense competition in the flexible packaging markets may adversely affect our operating results the business of supplying plastic packaging products is extremely competitive 
we believe that there are few barriers to entry into many of our markets 
as a result  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  competition resulting from new manufacturers of various types of film in our product line 
also  when new manufacturers enter the market for a product or existing manufacturers increase capacity  they frequently reduce prices to achieve increased market share 
companies can also develop products that have superior performance characteristics to our products 
any of these actions by our competitors can adversely affect our sales 
in addition  we face competition from a substantial number of companies  which sell similar and substitute packaging products 
some of these competitors are subsidiaries or divisions of large international diversified companies with extensive production facilities  well developed sales and marketing staffs and substantial financial resources 
competitive products are also available from a number of local manufacturers 
this results in competition which is highly price sensitive 
we also compete on the basis of quality  service  timely delivery and differentiation of product properties 
an increase in competition could result in material selling price reductions or loss of our market share 
this could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations which govern our operations and which may result in potential liability our operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations which govern discharges into the air and water  the storage  handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste  the remediation of soil and ground water contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or waste  and the health and safety of our employees 
future compliance with these laws and regulations may require material expenditures by us 
in addition  the nature of our current and former operations and the history of industrial uses at some of our manufacturing facilities expose us to the risk of liabilities or claims with respect to environmental and worker health and safety matters 
we may also be exposed to claims for violations of environmental laws and regulations by previous owners or operators of our property 
in addition  the presence of  or failure to remediate  hazardous substances or waste may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent any property or to use it as collateral for a loan 
we also may be liable for costs relating to the investigation  remediation or removal of hazardous waste and substances from a disposal or treatment facility to which we or our predecessors sent waste or materials 
company risks we experience fluctuations in operating income  which may cause our stock price to fluctuate our operating income loss has been subject to significant quarterly and annual fluctuations 
these fluctuations can be caused by global economic conditions  competition  variability in raw material prices  acquisitions  asset sales  business restructuring initiatives  seasonality  and foreign currency fluctuations these fluctuations make it more difficult for investors to compare our operating results to corresponding prior year periods 
these fluctuations may also cause our stock price to fluctuate 
you should not rely on our results of operations for any particular quarter or year as indicative of our results for a full year or any other quarter 
because we have limited contractual relationships with our customers  our customers may unilaterally reduce the purchase of our products we generally do not enter into long term contractual relationships with our customers 
as a result  our customers may unilaterally reduce the purchase of our products or  in certain cases  terminate existing orders for which we may have incurred significant production costs 
our business may be adversely affected by risks associated with foreign operations approximately of our revenues are generated from operations conducted outside north america 
conducting an international business inherently involves a number of difficulties and risks  including the following currency fluctuations  inflation  export restrictions  compliance with existing and changing regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in shifting production between different facilities  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability and economic downturns  seasonal reductions in business activity in europe during the summer months  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
we have experienced and may continue to experience any or all of these risks 
any of these factors may materially adversely affect our sales  profits  cash flow and financial position  which could adversely affect our stock price 
we may  from time to time  experience problems in our labor relations of our employees in north america  unions represent employees under three collective bargaining agreements 
these agreements expire in march negotiations to start in february and in february and march further  we have collective bargaining agreements at our international facilities  covering substantially all of the hourly employees at these facilities 
changes in these agreements  over which we have no control  could adversely affect us 
our business may be adversely affected by results of ongoing health and safety studies on plastics and resins continuing studies of the potential effect on health and safety of various resins and plastics  including polyvinyl chlorides  are being conducted by industry groups  government agencies and others 
the results of these studies  along with the development of any other new information  may adversely affect our ability to market and sell certain of our products or may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured by such products  any of which could adversely affect our profits and financial condition 
anti takeover and change of control provisions may adversely affect our stockholders our directors are elected for three year terms  so approximately one third of the board is elected each year 
we are subject to a delaware statute regulating business combinations 
these factors could discourage  hinder or preclude an unsolicited acquisition of our company and could make it less likely that stockholders receive a premium for their shares as a result of any such attempt 
in addition  our board of directors may issue  without stockholder approval  shares of preferred stock 
the preferred stock could have voting  liquidation  dividend or other rights superior to those of the common stock 
therefore  if we issue preferred stock  your rights as a common stockholder may be adversely affected 
in connection with our senior subordinated notes offering  we entered into an indenture which requires us  upon a change of control  to offer to purchase the outstanding senior subordinated notes 
if a change of control were to occur and we could not obtain a waiver or if we do not have the funds to make the purchase  we would be in default under the senior subordinated notes  which could depress our stock price 
possible violation of european competition law could adversely affect us in fiscal  the european commission served our holland subsidiary with a notice to produce various documents and other evidence relating to its investigation of a possible violation of european competition law by that subsidiary 
we are cooperating in this investigation 
no litigation has been instituted against us involving this matter 
however  we are not in a position to evaluate the outcome of the investigation 
if the litigation is instituted  a fine may be assessed 
we are not in a position to predict whether litigation will be commenced and  if commenced  and our subsidiary is found guilty  that the fine would not be material 
financial risks we have a high level of debt relative to our equity  which reduces cash available for our business  may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional funds and increases our vulnerability to economic or business downturns we are highly leveraged and our operations are subject to restrictions imposed by the terms of our indebtedness 
as at october   our total consolidated indebtedness  including short term borrowings and capitalized leases  was approximately million and our total shareholders equity was approximately million 
total indebtedness represented of the total capitalization 
accordingly  we are subject to all of the risks associated with substantial indebtedness  including a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be used to service our indebtedness  we will have reduced funds available for operations  future business opportunities and other purposes  our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate or other purposes may be impaired  we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and less able to withstand competitive pressures and react to changes in our industry and general economic conditions  the parent company to some extent finances its foreign subsidiaries  and as these inter company loans increase  our exposure to currency fluctuations and costs associated with these loans increases 
in addition  the indenture under which our million outstanding senior subordinated notes were issued and the loan and security agreement under which a major portion of our other borrowings were made contain covenants which may limit our operating flexibility with respect to certain business matters 
if we fail to meet our scheduled debt service requirements  we will need to refinance our indebtedness or sell material assets  and if we fail to do so  a substantial portion of our assets can be sold by the lenders under the loan and security agreement 
if we are unable to meet our future debt service requirements from our cash flow  we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness  selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital 
there can be no assurance that any of these actions could be taken on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or that we will be able to satisfy our additional capital requirements 
in addition  the terms of the indenture and the loan and security agreement may prohibit us from adopting any of one or more of the alternatives which might otherwise be available 
our borrowings under the loan and security agreement are secured by mortgages and liens on our domestic assets and on of our ownership interest in certain foreign subsidiaries 
accordingly  if a default occurs under the loan and security agreement and is not cured  it may result in a substantial reduction or termination of our business 
further  such default would also constitute default under the indenture pursuant to which our senior subordinated notes were issued
