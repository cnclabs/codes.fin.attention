item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview highlights our net product sales of approximately million in fiscal represented an increase of over fiscal our income from operations in fiscal increased by  or  over fiscal despite one time restructuring costs of million and million in legal and accounting fees associated with the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal and the investigation being conducted by the sec regarding the restatement 
restatement sec investigation in august  we decided to amend various reports previously filed with the sec to modify certain accounting matters related to our acquisition of smith wesson corp 
we decided to restate our financial statements for the fiscal year ended april  as well as our financial statements for the quarters ended july  and  october  and  and january  and the form ksb report for the fiscal year ended april  was filed in december and included restated financial statements for fiscal the amended form qsb reports for the july and october quarters were filed in january  and the amended form qsb reports for the january quarters were filed in march we are current in all of our sec filings 
the sec is conducting an investigation regarding the circumstances surrounding the restatement 
we are cooperating fully with the sec in this investigation 
the investigation is still ongoing 
management objectives in january  we decided to refocus our emphasis on our core business the manufacture and sale of quality firearms 
towards that end  we decided to discontinue our advanced technology and crossings catalog divisions  which were both unprofitable and a drain on our resources 
we also decided to close our corporate office in scottsdale  arizona and relocate our corporate functions and licensing operations  previously conducted in that office  to our main facility in springfield  massachusetts 
we believe that these actions will better enable us to devote our attention to our core business 
in addition  we expect to save million per year pre tax as a result of the closure of our corporate office in scottsdale 
our business we are one of the largest handgun manufacturers in the world 
we offer one of the broadest lines of handguns in the industry 
our product line consists of both revolvers and pistols 
we are also one of the largest manufacturers of handcuffs and restraints in the united states 
key performance indicators we evaluate the performance of our business based upon operating profit  which includes net sales  cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses  and certain components of other income and expense 
we also use ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization to evaluate our performance 
we evaluate our various product lines by such measurements as cost per unit produced  units produced per day  and incoming orders per day 

table of contents key industry data the handgun market in the united states has remained relatively constant over the past years 
handguns have been subject to legislative actions in the past  and the market has reacted to these actions 
there was a substantial increase in sales in the early s during the period leading up and shortly after the enactment of the brady bill 
in the period  the us handgun market increased by over  as consumers purchased handguns in fear of prohibition of handgun ownership 
the best measurement of us market share is federal excise tax collections 
this information is issued on a quarterly basis by the us government 
by comparing our tax payment to the reported collection  we can estimate our market share data 
based upon the most recent data  we believe that we have an share of the us consumer market 
this compares to in the period just before we acquired smith wesson corp 
it also compares favorably with market share figures of the s when we had an estimated market share 
results of operations net product sales the following table set forth certain information relative to net product sales for the fiscal years ended april    and change change revolvers pistols walther performance center other total firearms handcuffs specialty services other non firearms total we recorded net product sales of  in fiscal  an increase of  or  over fiscal firearms sales increased by  or 
total handgun unit sales in fiscal were approximately  units  an increase of over fiscal sales of approximately  units 
non firearm sales in fiscal declined by  or  compared to fiscal  as a result of our decision to exit certain non core businesses 
revolver sales increased by  or  in fiscal to  the introduction of new products  such as our model revolver  helped to fuel the increase in net product sales 
we sold over  model revolvers in fiscal  generating approximately million in sales 
during fiscal  we continued our aggressive pricing strategy by reducing the price on our m revolver 
sales for the m increased from approximately  units in fiscal to over  units in fiscal  representing an increase of approximately million 
the revolver order backlog was at  at april  
table of contents pistol sales of  were  or higher  in fiscal the increase in pistol sales was attributable to the full year impact of our sw pistol and an aggressive pricing strategy on our sigma ve pistol 
sales of the sw accounted for approximately million of the increase in pistol sales in fiscal the sigma ve pistol sales increased from approximately  units in fiscal to approximately  units in fiscal  an increase in sales of million  as a result of the new pricing 
partially offsetting some of the gains in these two areas was a decline in our traditional metal frame pistols and lower international pistol sales  which declined by approximately million and  respectively 
the higher cost of our traditional pistols puts us at a competitive disadvantage  particularly against foreign competitors whose labor costs are lower 
the pistol order backlog was at  at april  we are the exclusive us distributor of walther firearms 
this product line has grown considerably over the last two years 
walther sales totaled  in fiscal  an increase of  or  over the previous fiscal year 
the increase in walther sales was attributable to the success of the p pistol 
the walther order backlog was at  at april  performance center sales increased by  or  in fiscal to  custom variations of the model and sw were responsible for the increase in sales 
the performance center has an order backlog of  at april  non firearms sales declined by  or  in fiscal as a result of the discontinuation in late fiscal of certain product lines as part of our decision to focus more on the firearms business 
in fiscal  we discontinued our machining and cutter grinding businesses for third party customers  as well as our bicycle business 
we also closed four of our five retail locations in fiscal as a result of these decisions  non firearms sales declined by  in fiscal  partially offset by  in optics sales 
we discontinued the optics product line in fiscal  and our sales reflect the closeout of the inventory on hand 
in fiscal  net product sales increased  or  over fiscal net product sales of  firearms sales accounted for  of the increase  while non firearms sales accounted for  total handgun units sold increased by  from approximately  units in fiscal to approximately  units in fiscal the firearms sales increase was driven by increased demand for our products as consumers and dealers began buying smith wesson products again after we purchased smith wesson corp 
many consumers and dealers had been boycotting smith wesson products after smith wesson corp had signed an agreement with the us department of housing and urban development 
we launched an aggressive promotional effort after we acquired smith wesson corp  which persuaded dealers and consumers to resume buying our products 
the impact started in the latter portion of fiscal  but was more pronounced in fiscal we also introduced a number of new products  which also served to stimulate demand 
revolver sales increased by  or  in fiscal  reflecting the increased demand and an aggressive pricing program on the model sales of the model increased by approximately  units in fiscal  generating additional sales of approximately million 
pistol sales increased by  or  in fiscal as a result of the increased demand and the full year impact of the sw series of pistols 
sw pistol sales increased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal walther sales in fiscal reflected the full year impact of our distribution agreement versus four months in fiscal sales increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  an increase of 
fiscal sales only reflect four months of sales as our distribution of walther products began in january non firearms sales increased by  or  in fiscal the increase in non firearms sales was due to our specialty services business and handcuff sales 
our specialty services sales increased by  or  in fiscal to  as a result of the increase in our third party machining business 
handcuff sales increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 

table of contents licensing revenue the following table sets forth certain information relative to licensing revenue for the fiscal years ended april    and change change licensing revenue in fiscal increased by  or  over the previous fiscal year 
the increase in licensing revenue resulted from new licensees added during the year 
we have relocated our licensing operations to our springfield facility and have retained a consultant to assist us in enhancing our licensing efforts 
we plan to focus on areas that have synergy with our core products  our brand  and our customer base 
we also intend to add additional licensees and to develop strategies with our existing licensees to assist them in expanding their business and thereby increase our licensing revenue 
cost of goods sold and services and gross profit the following table sets forth certain information regarding cost of good sold and services and gross profit for the fiscal years ended april    and change change cost of goods sold and services of net product sales and licensing revenue gross profit of net product sales and licensing revenue gross profit in fiscal increased by  or  over fiscal the increase in gross profit was attributable to the increase in net product sales as well as improvements in efficiency 
our increased handgun production  without a corresponding increase in staffing and infrastructure  has led to improved efficiency as evidenced by the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net product sales and licensing revenue 
the dismissal of several of the municipal litigation cases resulted in a reduction of our reserves 
this had a favorable impact on gross profit of  or  over fiscal refunds from insurance carriers on defense costs paid in fiscal reduced cost of sales by  gross profit  as a percentage of net product sales and licensing revenue  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit in fiscal increased by  or  over fiscal again  the contributing factors to the increase in gross profit were the increase in sales and improved efficiency as a result of the increased production to meet the higher demand 
gross profit  as a percentage of net product sales and licensing revenue  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal 
table of contents operating expenses the following table sets forth certain information regarding operating expenses for the fiscal years ended april    and change change research and development  net sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring costs environmental costs operating expenses of net product sales and licensing revenue operating expenses in fiscal increased by  or  over fiscal of the increase in fiscal operating expenses   related to the discontinued crossings catalog and advanced technology divisions   related to the restructuring costs relative to the closing our corporate office in scottsdale   related to legal and accounting fees relative to the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal and the sec investigation   related to higher profit sharing expenses due to increased profits   related to increased advertising expenses  and  related to higher management bonuses 
operating expenses increased by  or  in fiscal over the previous fiscal year 
of the increase in operating expenses   related to promotional efforts   related to higher profit sharing expense as a result of higher profits   related to salaries and fringe benefits  and  related to research and development costs associated with advanced technology products 
in fiscal  we incurred  in severance costs as a result of our decision to discontinue our third party machining business and our bicycle business 
we also incurred an additional  in consulting fees 
in fiscal  there were one time charges relating to our acquisition of smith wesson corp 
that totaled  in addition  we incurred a one time charge of  to provide for environmental remediation costs at our springfield facility in fiscal operating income loss the following table sets forth certain information regarding operating income for the fiscal years ended april    and change change operating income loss of net product sales and licensing revenue operating income was  in fiscal  an increase of compared to operating income of  in fiscal the increase reflected the improved results of our handgun operation and the reduction of the municipal litigation reserve  partially offset by the losses incurred by the discontinued divisions  restructuring costs  and legal and accounting fees related to the restatement and the sec investigation 
the following table illustrates the impact of these items on operating income 
table of contents change change operating income as reported catalog division loss advanced technology division loss restructuring cost sec legal and accounting adjusted operating income operating income in fiscal  after adjusting for one time items and discontinued products and services  increased by approximately million  or  over fiscal the increase in operating profit was attributable to increased firearms sales and improved utilization of our springfield facility  as well as the reduction of the municipal litigation reserve 
these factors drove the  increase in gross profit as well as the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net product sales and licensing revenue from to 
operating income of  in fiscal was  higher than our operating loss of  in fiscal gross profit in fiscal increased by  or  over the previous fiscal year 
the increase was again attributable to the  increase in net product sales as well as improved efficiency due to a higher utilization of our springfield manufacturing facility 
other income expense other expense totaled  in fiscal compared to income of  in fiscal other expense included a  exchange loss related to purchase of inventory from walther 
while we purchased forward contracts to hedge against exchange losses  the dollar declined so significantly against the euro that we were unable to protect ourselves fully against the loss 
partially offsetting this loss were insurance refunds on municipal litigation costs of  other income of  in fiscal included an insurance refund of  and a gain on the sale of land of  these two items were partially offset by an inventory adjustment of  to write down the optics and versa vault inventories down to market value 
other expense was  in fiscal interest income of  in fiscal represented a decline of  versus  in fiscal due to reduced cash available for investment as well as a decline in interest rates on invested cash 
interest income of  in fiscal declined  from fiscal interest income of  the decrease was also attributable to the lower interest rates on invested cash and a lower amount of cash available for investment 
interest expense the following table sets forth certain information regarding interest expense for the fiscal years ended april    and change change interest expense declined in fiscal by  due to repayments made in fiscal and on the tomkins note 
we made early payments on the tomkins note in fiscal  totaling  we repaid an additional  in fiscal the interest rate on this note is 
the  in interest in fiscal included approximately million in amortization of debt issue costs related to the financing in conjunction with our purchase of smith wesson corp 

table of contents income taxes our income tax benefit for fiscal was  compared to an income tax benefit of  in fiscal the tax benefit for fiscal was primarily attributable to the federal net operating loss adjustments described below and the reversal of  of our state tax valuation allowance 
the tax benefit in fiscal of  related primarily to the reversal of  and  of federal and state tax valuation allowances 
income tax expense of  in fiscal was for state income taxes 
there was no deferred tax provision in fiscal due to the valuation allowances 
the fiscal tax provision included a  benefit for federal net operating loss adjustments 
this benefit related to the filing of amended fiscal and federal income tax returns to recognize tax deductions for warrant and option exercises 
we were previously not entitled to these deductions as we had not complied with federal statutory reporting requirements 
we have subsequently complied with these reporting requirements  and we therefore are now entitled to realize these tax benefits related to the warrant and option exercises 
our income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets  liabilities  and net operating loss carryforwards 
these amounts are reflected in the balance of our net deferred tax assets  which totaled approximately million  before valuation allowance  at april  in assessing the realization of our deferred income tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets depends upon generating future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary differences become deductible and before our net operating loss carryforwards expire 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets by assessing the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be recovered  a valuation allowance will be established against some or all of our deferred income tax assets 
recording a valuation allowance or reversing a valuation allowance could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
as of april   we had a federal and state valuation allowance established against our deferred tax assets of approximately million and million respectively 
based on the operational changes discussed below  no valuation allowance was provided on our deferred federal income tax assets as of april  and  as we believe that it is more likely than not that all such assets will be realized 
we do  however  continue to maintain a valuation allowance of  and  provided against our state deferred tax assets as of april  and  respectively 
this valuation allowance specifically relates to state net operating loss carryforwards 
there is uncertainty related to the recognition of the benefit attributable to these state net operating losses 
we reached these conclusions after considering both changes in our business as well as the availability of taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies  and the likelihood of generating future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
differences between forecasted and actual future operating results could adversely impact our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
we reached these conclusions despite the existence of cumulative losses in recent years 
cumulative losses are weighted heavily in the overall assessment of the need for a valuation allowance 
however  we believe our current year pre tax income  pre tax income in fiscal  our utilization of approximately  of federal net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal  and the additional positive evidence discussed below outweigh the negative evidence of the cumulative losses 
in making this assessment  we took into consideration the existence of significant expenses in the fiscal year ended april  relating to the acquisition of smith wesson corp  that are not recurring in this or future fiscal years 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended april   we determined that a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was no longer needed  with the exception for certain state deferred tax assets 
in prior years  we had losses before income taxes for financial reporting purposes 
however  for fiscal years ended april  and  we are reporting pre tax income of approximately million and million  respectively 
we believe that existing levels of income from changes in our operations that have taken place or will take place are sufficient to generate the minimum amounts of taxable income set forth below to utilize our deferred tax assets and net operating losses before they expire 
such changes included i maintaining a strong order backlog  ii successful launch of new firearm products in fiscal  which have been well received by the marketplace  iii new licensing strategies  which are projected to generate royalty income  and iv other changes in an effort to increase the 
table of contents efficiency of our business operations  including the closing of our scottsdale  arizona office and discontinuing our crossings catalog and the advanced technology divisions 
to utilize all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards before expiration  we would need to generate minimum taxable income of million the amount of net operating loss carryforwards before as of april   we have total gross book as compared to tax temporary differences of million  which may result in future tax deductions 
therefore  future income of million would need to be generated to realize all of our deferred tax assets 
we believe our current level of pre tax earnings are sufficient to realize all of these deferred tax assets 
the following chart reconciles our income loss before taxes for financial statement purposes to our taxable income loss for income tax purposes year ended year ended year ended april  april  april  dollars in millions income loss before income taxes adjustments to determine taxable income depreciation gain loss on sale of land installment sale product liability section a unicap adjust lifo to fifo accounting change adjustment financing costs various reserves accruals inventory obsolescence environmental reserve inventory step up acquisition other book vs 
tax differences utilization of net operating loss carryforwards taxable income at april   we had federal income tax loss carryforwards of  available subject to various statutory restrictions for use on future federal income tax returns 
these carryforwards will expire as follows  expires  expires  expires  expires  expires  expires utilization of these losses may be limited by certain federal statutory provisions 
in conjunction with the acquisition of smith wesson corp  there may have been a cumulative change in ownership over a three year period pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
additional analysis is still required in order to conclude whether or not a section change has occurred 
however  these provisions are not expected to impair our ability to realize these assets prior to expiration 
based on our projections of future taxable income  we expect to utilize the largest portion of our net operating loss carryforward over the next five to six years 
finally  since our net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until  and based on our projections of future financial reporting income  we expect to utilize all 
table of contents of our net deferred income tax assets of million after  state tax valuation allowance over the next seven to eight years 
net income loss the following table sets forth certain information regarding net income loss and the related per share data for the fiscal years ended april    and change change net income loss net income loss per share basic diluted the decrease in net income and net income per share in fiscal resulted primarily from the comparative effect of an income tax valuation allowance reversed in fiscal of approximately million that resulted in an income tax benefit 
the release of the allowance was triggered by our improved profitability and the likelihood that we would be able to utilize income tax loss carryforwards 
in addition  the losses associated with our crossings catalog and advanced technology divisions  the restructuring charges incurred in the third quarter  and the costs related to the restatement and the sec inquiry eroded the profitability in fiscal the  loss in fiscal was attributable to a number of items 
our results included million in provision for environmental remediation and an additional million in product liability provision 
as indicated in the interest expense section  we incurred approximately million in amortization of debt issue costs relative to the acquisition of smith wesson corp 
in addition  there were a number of costs associated with the acquisition  including  in legal and accounting fees   in debt extinguishment costs  and approximately million in other expenses 
liquidity and capital resources our principal cash requirements are to finance the growth of our firearms and licensing operations and to service our existing debt 
capital expenditures for new products  capacity expansion  and process improvements represent important cash needs 
while one of our strengths is our ability to generate cash from operations in excess of our internal operating needs  certain loan covenants in the tomkins note preclude us from repaying other indebtedness and other obligations utilizing cash from our wholly owned subsidiary  smith wesson corp 
the following table sets forth certain information relative to cash flow for the fiscal years ended april    and change change operating activities investing activities financing activities total operating activities represent the principal source of our cash flow 
cash flow from operating activities increased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal the improvement in operating cash flow in fiscal was attributable to improved profitability 
we launched an aggressive sales promotion campaign in january 
table of contents the program included extended payment terms to our distributors 
as a result  accounts receivable collections were lower than our historical levels 
while this program resulted in higher sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal  the cash impact will not be felt until fiscal cash flow from operating activities decreased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of our receipt in fiscal of  from tomkins in connection with our acquisition of smith wesson corp 
apart from this transaction  cash flow from operating activities would have improved by approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal cash used for investing activities increased by  in fiscal  partially as a result of a  increase in capital expenditures 
collateralized cash deposits increased by  as a result of banking agreements relative to the forward exchange contracts we have purchased 
the fiscal cash flow provided by investing activities resulted from our acquisition of smith wesson corp and the cash balance on its books 
we intend to spend approximately million on capital expenditures in fiscal the major capital expenditures will focus on increasing revolver production capacity to meet the increased demand and on expanding our pistol product line 
the  decrease in cash used for financing activities in fiscal resulted from our repayment of  in debt in fiscal compared to  in fiscal repayment on the note to banknorth  our primary bank  commenced in april  and principal payments on the tomkins note commenced in may the financing activities in fiscal related to our acquisition of smith wesson corp in may and the related costs associated with financing that transaction 
as of april   we had open letters of credit aggregating million 
as of april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we have credit facilities with banknorth to support letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business 
borrowing capacity is limited  however  by the covenants in the tomkins note 
the covenants prohibit additional borrowing capacity until the tomkins note has been repaid in full 
the covenants in the tomkins note also limit the amount of money that we can withdraw from our subsidiary  smith wesson corp 
while we do not believe that this will be an issue during the upcoming fiscal year  over the longer term  we will need to restructure the tomkins debt in order to address the issues raised by the restrictive covenants in the tomkins note 
we have retained an investment banking firm to assist us with refinancing activities 
other matters inflation we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on us during fiscal   or critical accounting policies principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of smith wesson holding corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries smith wesson corp  smith wesson firearms training center gmbh germany  smith wesson distributing  inc  smith wesson  inc  smith wesson licensing  llc  smith wesson interactive management  llc  smith wesson technology  llc  and lost coast ventures  inc inactive and its majority owned subsidiary smith wesson advanced technologies  llc 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
use of estimates in preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts 
table of contents of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
operating results in the future could vary from the amounts derived from these estimates and assumptions 
in addition  future facts and circumstances could alter our estimates with respect to the adequacy of insurance reserves 
the more significant estimates and assumptions used by the us in the preparation of the financial statements relate to the reserves established for uncollectible accounts receivable  obsolete and slow moving inventory  and certain accrued liabilities  including product  environmental  and warranty liabilities and workers compensation 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of products are recognized when title to the products are transferred to the customer product shipment  when no further contingencies or material performance obligations exist  when collectibility is reasonably assured  and when we have earned the right to receive and retain payments for products shipped and billed 
we recognize tooling  forging  heat treating  finishing  plating  and engineering support revenues after acceptance by the customer and when no further contingencies or material performance obligations exist  when collectibility is reasonably assured  and when we have earned the right to receive and retain payments for services performed and billed 
we recognize revenue from use of our registered trademarks and from licenses to use our identi kit software 
software revenue is recognized over the subscription period 
trademark licensing revenues consists of i initial fees that are collected upon the signing of  or upon meeting certain conditions in  the licensing agreement and ii minimum royalties and or a percentage of a licensee s sales of licensed products that are collectible over a multi year period 
we recognize trademark licensing revenues for all individual licensees on a quarterly basis based on actual receipts due from licensees through the date of our financial statements 
this revenue consists of minimum royalties and or a percentage of a licensee s sales on licensed products 
under our current licensing agreements  these revenues are payable on a calendar quarter basis 
fees received upon initial signing of license agreements are recognized as revenues to the extent of costs incurred 
as a result of a combination of uncertain factors regarding existing licensees  including current and past payment performance  market acceptance of the licensee s product  and insufficient historical experience  we believe that reasonable assurance of collectibility does not exist based on the results and past payment performance of licensees in general 
therefore  we do not initially recognize minimum royalty payments  but instead record such revenue over the period the minimum royalty becomes due and payable 
we also believe that  due to the factors noted above  an allowance for uncollectible minimum royalties cannot be reasonably estimated 
our accounting policy addresses our license revenue as a single class of transactions 
we have contractual  undiscounted  minimum royalties of  over the next five years while certain agreements extend beyond that period 
product liability we provide reserves for potential product liability defense costs based on estimates determined in consultation with litigation counsel 
adjustments to the provision for product liability are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are charged or credited to cost of sales 
this evaluation is based upon information regarding potential or existing product liability cases 
any future costs as a result of this evaluation are recorded when considered both probable and reasonably estimable 
at this time  the estimated range of reasonably possible additional losses  as that term is defined in sfas no 
 is zero 
stock options we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits revised fas  as revised 
fas  as revised  requires additional disclosures about pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans compared with those required in the original fasb statement these disclosures require that additional information be provided related to assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit post retirement plans 
fas  as revised  also requires that information be provided regarding the types of plan assets  investment strategy  and measurement date s 
most of the required disclosures under fas  as revised  that are pertinent to us were effective for annual periods ending after december  and interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities revised december  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation requires variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit an entity to finance its activities without support from other parties or the equity investors lack certain specified characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
we do not currently have any accounting or disclosure requirements under the provisions of this interpretation 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of april  less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations expected pension contributions total off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any transactions  arrangements  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to affect our liquidity or capital resources

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
our principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar 
a portion of our gross product sales during 
table of contents the three and months ended april  million and million  respectively  representing approximately and  respectively  of aggregate gross revenues came from the sale of goods that were purchased  wholly or partially  from a european manufacturer  in euros 
annually  we purchase approximately million of inventory from a european supplier 
this exposes us to risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a drop in the value of the us dollar in relation to the euro would  to the extent not covered through price adjustments  reduce our gross profit on that million of inventory by approximately million 
in an effort to offset our risk from unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations  we enter into euro forward contracts 
forward contracts entered into during the past three fiscal years consist of the following contract average rate original amount remaining date per euro in euros balance in euros
